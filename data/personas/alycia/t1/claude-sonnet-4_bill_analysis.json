The deponent needs to be thoroughly prepared to authenticate these documents and establish proper chain of custody, as any successful challenge to key documentary evidence could significantly undermine Norfolk Southern's defense.",

This creates a critical gap that needs to be narrowed down. I would press for specifics: What exactly was Trinity's polymerization input? Who at Trinity provided it? When? In what form? To whom? \n\nThis line of questioning could reveal either that Trinity's involvement was more extensive than claimed, or establish clear boundaries that protect the client from liability for decisions outside their expertise.
