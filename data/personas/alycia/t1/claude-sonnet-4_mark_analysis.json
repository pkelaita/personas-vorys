This foundation is critical because it will determine the validity and scope of every answer he gives throughout the deposition, and any gaps in his preparation could expose Norfolk Southern to sanctions or adverse inferences.\n\nMy next line of questioning would systematically go through each designated topic, confirm his preparation process, identify his sources of information, and establish clear boundaries around what he can and cannot testify to on behalf of the corporation.",
