I will ensure he adheres strictly to our preparation: pause, listen carefully, answer *only* the question asked, and do not volunteer a single word beyond it, thereby establishing a disciplined, fact-limited tone for the remainder of the deposition.",
  "chunk_0-1": "Be prepared to object if the questioning strays beyond the specific topics enumerated in the deposition notice.",
  "chunk_0-2": "Before making any other move, I must obtain and review the complete deposition transcript and all associated exhibits. I can't start digging until I have the dirt.",
  "chunk_0-3": "Establish on the record the exact, enumerated 30(b)(6) topics this witness was prepared to testify on, and confirm that their preparation was limited to those specific subjects to prevent opposing counsel from pushing them into unprepared-for topics.",
  "chunk_0-4": "Object to the question as likely being overly broad or seeking to improperly close the door, and instruct the witness to answer only based on the specific information they personally reviewed in preparation for the deposition.",
  "chunk_0-5": "Compel counsel to define \"the Norfolk\" on the record before allowing the witness to answer, to eliminate ambiguity and prevent them from testifying to a potentially inaccurate premise.",
  "chunk_0-6": "Listen to the complete question to identify the specific subject matter being referenced, assess its connection to our key documents, and prepare any necessary objection on the record.",
  "chunk_0-7": "On my redirect examination, I would solidify the distinction between the witness's personal knowledge and a definitive corporate statement by asking: \"You testified that *you* don't have any information that Trinity provided input on the vent and burn; are you aware of what every other engineer or employee at Trinity may have discussed on that topic?\"",
  "chunk_0-8": "On redirect, establish the data-driven rationale for the 200-degree industry standard, specifically eliciting testimony on the significant operational risks and network-wide safety hazards created by the high rate of \"false positives\" that a lower, more sensitive threshold would trigger.",
  "chunk_0-9": "Focus my redirect examination on clarifying the witness's definition of \"input,\" seeking to reframe their absolute statement to mean a lack of final decision-making authority rather than a total absence of participation.",
  "chunk_0-10": "Instruct the witness on the record to answer questions based only on the information he has reviewed, and not to adopt counsel\u2019s attempts to characterize that testimony as an absolute \u201ctrue\u201d or \u201cfalse.\u201d",
  "chunk_0-11": "Immediately locate that page in my own copy of the exhibit to anticipate the specific admission or inconsistency opposing counsel is targeting, ensuring I am ready for the attack before the question is even asked.",
  "chunk_0-12": "Before counsel asks the next question, I would instruct my client: \"Take your time. Read the entire page to ensure you understand the full context of that paragraph before you answer.\"",
  "chunk_0-13": "Object for lack of foundation and insist that counsel identify the document from which they are reading and provide the witness a copy to review the full paragraph before answering.",
  "chunk_0-14": "Establish the full context of the quoted document and lock down testimony on all the specific, unusual facts of *this* derailment that made the \"typical\" options inapplicable or insufficient.",
  "chunk_0-15": "Ask the witness to please read the entire sentence and the following sentence from the document, and then to identify that document by its title, date, and Bates number for the record.",
  "chunk_0-16": "Immediately clarify, on the record, what specific inspection was performed on that tank car to assess its structural integrity and safety *before* the decision was made to re-rail and move it.",
  "chunk_0-17": "Immediately seek to clarify the record and lock down the testimony by asking: \"Is the process you just described for making that determination outlined in a specific written policy, procedure, or other document?\"",
  "chunk_0-18": "Establish the witness's precise role in this report's creation, focusing on the fact that he is a project manager relying on the conclusions of his engineering team, not an engineer making his own technical assessment of the damage.",
  "chunk_0-19": "Listen intently for the remainder of the question, but be prepared to object that it is vague as to time and instruct my witness not to guess about an unspecified timeframe.",
  "chunk_0-20": "Object on the grounds that the term \"re-railing\" is vague, ambiguous, and assumes facts not in evidence. Demand that opposing counsel clarify precisely what activity they are referring to before the witness is permitted to answer.",
  "chunk_0-21": "On redirect, I will use a line of questioning to precisely define the word \"considered\"\u2014clarifying the specific actions, duration, and outcome\u2014to prevent opposing counsel from exaggerating the nature of that consideration.",
  "chunk_0-22": "Object on the grounds of vagueness and ambiguity until opposing counsel specifies precisely which individuals they mean by \"the folks at Norfolk\" and clarifies the context of the forthcoming question.",
  "chunk_0-23": "Insist the witness differentiate the specific, distinct actions taken by each entity\u2014Southern, SPSI, and SRS\u2014individually, rather than allowing them to be vaguely grouped together under the term \"helped.\"",
  "chunk_0-24": "Use my examination to establish that the witness's answer was an assumption and that they have no direct, personal knowledge of who reviewed those specific options, thereby neutralizing their speculative testimony.",
  "chunk_0-25": "Immediately work to de-bundle the term \"contractors,\" forcing opposing counsel to specify which entity they are asking about so you can confine the testimony to the precise, documented, and limited scope of that specific independent contractor's engagement.",
  "chunk_0-26": "Object that the question calls for speculation. Instruct the deponent to confine any answer to what company policy and the facts of *this specific incident* dictated, not what the company might hypothetically \"consider.\"",
  "chunk_0-27": "Call for a break to confer with my client and ensure he can articulate the specific, non-speculative factual basis for his \"safety reasons\" answer before he testifies further.",
  "chunk_0-28": "Prepare to object that the question calls for speculation and ensure the witness answers based only on their personal knowledge, not what they presume the entire corporation or its various agents \"would\" do.",
  "chunk_0-29": "Object to the question as incomplete and ambiguous. Instruct the witness not to answer until opposing counsel finishes the question and clarifies the specific factual predicate he is referencing.",
  "chunk_0-30": "On redirect, I will use the specific maintenance logs and federal inspection reports for that tank car to have the witness clarify exactly what the pressure release device \"was not,\" anchoring their testimony to the documentary record to neutralize the damaging ambiguity.",
  "chunk_0-31": "Object to the pending question as overbroad and instruct the witness he can only testify as to his personal knowledge, not speculate on what \"nobody at Norfolk Southern\" knew.",
  "chunk_0-32": "Insist that opposing counsel provide the witness with the entire document and ask him to first read the full paragraph 120, including all subparagraphs and introductory clauses, for complete context before answering any questions about one isolated part.",
  "chunk_0-33": "Confine the witness's testimony exclusively to the documented history\u2014lease, inspection, and maintenance records\u2014of Car 26 to prevent speculation and force opposing counsel to ground their questions in specific, established facts.",
  "chunk_0-34": "Object to the vague premise of \"discrepancies.\" Demand counsel place the AAR 4-2 document in front of the witness, identify exactly what it is allegedly discrepant *with*, and point to the specific lines in question before my witness answers.",
  "chunk_0-35": "Based on my analysis, the next step is:\n\nForce opposing counsel to precisely link that specific certificate to that specific tank. I would press them to establish, on the record, the exhibit number, date, and any serial or identification numbers on the certificate, and then require them to have the witness confirm those identifiers match the as-built specifications and data plate of the actual tank in question before allowing any substantive questions about its contents.",
  "chunk_0-36": "Focus on establishing all other representations made about the car outside of this specific document, such as oral statements, emails, or different advertisements, to demonstrate my client\u2019s reliance on a broader set of facts not covered by this particular disclaimer.",
  "chunk_0-37": "Object to the question's form as vague and ambiguous. Demand opposing counsel specify exactly which individual from \"Norfolk\" they are asking about before allowing my witness to answer.",
  "chunk_0-38": "During the next break, I would ask my client what they thought the question about \"Southern\" was going to be, and immediately cross-reference that word against my case chronology and key documents to neutralize that line of attack before opposing counsel inevitably returns to it.",
  "chunk_0-39": "Object that the question improperly calls for a legal conclusion and invades attorney work product. I would instruct my client not to create an exhaustive list, but to answer questions about specific facts he personally knows or documents shown to him."
