  "chunk_0-0": "Ensure the witness, in response to the inevitable questions about his preparation, precisely defines the scope of his testimony by stating that his knowledge is based solely on the specific corporate information he reviewed for the designated 30(b)(6) topics, thereby establishing the boundaries for the entire deposition.",
  "chunk_0-1": "Object and instruct the witness not to answer questions about the contents of the notice or the process used to locate documents, as that improperly probes into matters of legal strategy and attorney work-product.",
  "chunk_0-2": "Based on my analysis, the single most important strategic point to focus on next is to pivot the witness's testimony to narrowly define her role within the larger, multi-agency \"system architecture\" of the incident response. Her answers must clarify that she was retained to analyze a specific dataset provided by the Unified Command, and that the responsibility for determining sampling locations and methodology (i.e., soil testing, basement monitoring) resided with other experts, such as the EPA's field teams, who were tasked with the data *collection* part of the system.",
  "chunk_0-3": "Pivot the testimony to the corporation's system of preparation, detailing every person the witness spoke with and every document they reviewed to become knowledgeable on the specified topic, thereby demonstrating our good-faith effort to comply.",
  "chunk_0-4": "After they complete that answer, I will immediately begin mapping the corporate architecture by asking: \"And what specific company policy, organizational chart, or other internal document establishes that person/committee as the designated authority on this matter?\"",
  "chunk_0-5": "Object to the question as ambiguous and instruct the witness not to answer until opposing counsel clarifies the specific legal entity\u2014or entities\u2014they are referencing by \"Norfolk Southern Railway\" and \"the Norfolk,\" and to define the scope of their question as it pertains to each distinct corporation.",
  "chunk_0-6": "Object to the question's form as vague and ambiguous, and instruct the witness not to answer until opposing counsel precisely defines what \"certain\" refers to.",
  "chunk_0-7": "On redirect, I will establish the precise operational and communication boundaries of this witness's specific role to demonstrate *why* they would not be privy to information about the vent and burn decision, thereby neutralizing opposing counsel's attempt to equate this individual's knowledge with the corporation's.",
  "chunk_0-8": "Strictly limit the witness's testimony to the specific topics designated in the Rule 30(b)(6) notice and their direct, personal knowledge. Vigorously object to and instruct the witness not to answer any questions that attempt to use them as a human index to \"map the architecture\" of the entire corporation, speculate on the feasibility of data retrieval from systems outside their purview, or name other potential deponents not directly related to their designated topics.",
  "chunk_0-9": "Let's take that as a given for a moment. Walk me through the exact, step-by-step process for how the decision *was* made. Who initiated the discussion, what information did they review, and who had the final authority to give the green light?",
  "chunk_0-10": "Object to the form and for mischaracterizing the testimony. I would then instruct my witness to distinguish carefully between his personal knowledge and a blanket statement about the company, and to state clearly if he cannot answer a \"true/false\" question because it assumes facts or knowledge he does not have.",

  "chunk_0-14": "Challenge the premise that these \"four options\" existed in a vacuum; I will object and instruct the witness to only answer regarding the options and information that were *actually known and available to them* amidst the chaos of the live, evolving incident, not based on a sterile, after-the-fact document.",
  "chunk_0-15": "Demand that opposing counsel identify the document by exhibit number and read the full sentence and surrounding paragraph into the record, ensuring complete context before my witness answers a question based on a fragment.",
  "chunk_0-16": "Focus the line of questioning on establishing the specific, step-by-step company safety protocol and the on-site job briefing that governed the re-railing, anchoring every action in a formal, approved procedure.",
  "chunk_0-17": "Object to the question as vague and calling for speculation. Instruct the witness not to answer until counsel can ground the hypothetical by identifying who \"they\" are and what specific policy governs their determination process.",
  "chunk_0-18": "Immediately establish the full context and provenance of the document\u2014its author, date, and purpose\u2014before allowing any further questions that would require my client to interpret, adopt, or speculate on the meaning of that isolated phrase.",
  "chunk_0-19": "Use this question as an entry point to meticulously \"scene paint\" the event, forcing a precise timeline and context (how, where, who else was present) to undermine any attempt at creating a misleading narrative and to begin mapping the corroborating evidence.",
  "chunk_0-20": "Methodically deconstruct the risk assessment that precipitated the re-railing attempt: what specific structural inspections were performed on that car, who conducted them, what were the precise findings, and what written protocol authorized moving a compromised vinyl chloride tanker versus securing it in place.",
  "chunk_0-21": "Drill down on the term \"considered\" to define precisely what actions that entailed, who specifically was involved, where the consideration was documented, and what the specific outcome and rationale were.",
  "chunk_0-22": "Object on the grounds that the term \"the folks at Norfolk\" is vague and ambiguous, and instruct my client not to answer until counsel clarifies precisely which individuals they are referring to and establishes my client's personal knowledge of them.",
  "chunk_0-23": "Let's take those one at a time. Starting with Southern, specifically describe everything they did to help.",
  "chunk_0-24": "Take a break to instruct the witness to stop speculating about what the \"team\" was doing and to answer questions based only on their direct, personal knowledge.",
  "chunk_0-25": "Instruct the witness to only testify about their own personal knowledge, clarifying the specific contractor they are referring to and what they personally observed them do, distinct from what they saw Southern employees do.",
  "chunk_0-26": "Focus the testimony on the specific, documented safety protocols and multi-factor risk assessment that govern any re-railing decision, rather than allowing the witness to speculate on an incomplete hypothetical.",
  "chunk_0-27": "Take a break to instruct my client to stop offering broad, conclusory answers like \"for safety reasons\" and to testify only about the specific, factual instructions they were given or procedures they followed.",
  "chunk_0-28": "After the question is completed, object to its form as likely calling for speculation and instruct the witness to answer only based on their personal, firsthand knowledge of policies or procedures they were actually responsible for, not what the entire corporation might do.",
  "chunk_0-29": "Establish the precise source for that standard. I'd ask: \"Is that 'if' condition written down in a field manual, a General Code of Operating Rules provision, a contractor agreement, or is it just an unwritten rule of thumb? I need to see the document that governs the architecture of that decision.\"",
  "chunk_0-30": "Explain, step-by-step, your company's protocol for inspecting and maintaining that exact type of pressure release device, and then identify every person responsible for executing that protocol on this specific tank car in the twelve months before the incident.",
  "chunk_0-31": "On the next break, instruct the witness to clarify the specific limits of their role and redirect the inquiry to the proper corporate channel, for instance: \"I'm not personally aware, as that type of hardware analysis would be conducted by the Mechanical Department, not by someone in my position.\"",
  "chunk_0-32": "Before my witness answers, I would ask opposing counsel to identify the full document by its title, author, date, and Bates number to establish the complete context from which this isolated phrase is being taken.",
  "chunk_0-33": "Describe for me the specific software, database, or records system Trinity uses to track the complete lifecycle of its rail cars, and then walk me through the exact steps you would take within that system to pull the entire file for Car 26, from its acquisition to today.",
  "chunk_0-34": "Immediately pivot to establishing the complete systemic context of the AAR 4-2\u2014who authored it, when, what specific source data was used in its creation, and this deponent's precise role in that process\u2014before allowing my witness to address the substance of any alleged discrepancy.",
  "chunk_0-35": "Trace the path of this certificate for me: starting with the underlying data and inspections required to create it, through the specific database or filing system where the final version is stored and how it is linked to this specific tank.",
  "chunk_0-36": "Have the witness read the entire paragraph aloud to provide full context for the record before answering any questions about that specific phrase.",
  "chunk_0-37": "Object that the question is incomplete and instruct my witness not to answer until a full, clear question has been posed for the record.",
  "chunk_0-38": "Take a break to ask my client what they anticipated the full question about \"Southern\" was going to be, allowing us to prepare for the rephrased version which counsel is clearly struggling to frame correctly.",
  "chunk_0-39": "Object to the form of the question as overly broad and vague. Instruct the witness not to create an exhaustive list from memory, and direct opposing counsel to ask about specific facts or documents."
