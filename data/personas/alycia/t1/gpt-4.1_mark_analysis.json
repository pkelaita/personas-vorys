  "chunk_0-1": "Ask the witness:  \n\u201cDid you personally receive or review the notice referenced in this question, and can you describe precisely how such notices are typically handled or processed within your organization?\u201d",
  "chunk_0-2": "Seek granular, scene-painting testimony regarding **how and where records relating to train operations, safety incidents, and maintenance are generated, stored, and accessed** at Norfolk Southern\u2014naming specific databases, forms, physical or digital logs, and the roles of personnel involved\u2014to systematically map the information architecture and underpin both discoverability and substantive liability arguments.",
  "chunk_0-3": "Clarify and press for the precise scope and subjects on which the requesting party wants the witness to testify\u2014pin them down on the specific topics or Rule 30(b)(6) categories\u2014so you can ensure the right preparatory focus and prevent later expansion or \u201ctopic creep.\u201d",

This serves both to map potential sources of relevant evidence and to systematically undermine any future burden or lack-of-knowledge assertions.",
  "chunk_0-7": "Zero in on the **actual mechanics of decision-making authority**: Ask the deponent to diagram or explicitly describe the system\u2014organizationally and procedurally\u2014by which third parties (like Trinity) would or could provide input on vent and burn decisions for derailed cars, including any standard protocols, communication channels, or required documentation, to systematically clarify if their absence of involvement is routine, documented, or deviates from norms.",

I want to ensure we are discussing the same material.\u201d",
  "chunk_0-13": "My next move would be to immediately ask the examining attorney to finish reading Paragraph 81 in its entirety, or to provide the full text myself and confirm the witness is seeing it, ensuring we are operating with the complete context before proceeding. This prevents piecemeal questioning, supports scene-painting for a full and accurate record, and helps avoid any misrepresentation or undue pressure on the witness.",
  "chunk_0-14": "Ask the witness: \u201cCan you walk me through, step by step, what the four options are for responders in a tank car derailment and fire, and then explain in detail how, in your experience or training, responders determine which option to choose in an unfolding emergency?\u201d",

This will let me map the system architecture, connect roles to actions, and uncover specific knowledge or gaps.",

  "chunk_0-24": "Ask the witness to specifically identify who, by name and role, was on \u201cthat team,\u201d and to clarify what direct knowledge (versus assumption) they have of each person\u2019s participation or review of the options\u2014pressing for the factual basis of their statement rather than generalizations or assumptions.",
  "chunk_0-25": "Ask the witness to clarify and specify:  \n\u201cWhen you refer to \u2018Southern and its contractors that it hired,\u2019 can you name each of the contractors specifically involved, describe their respective roles, and explain how their responsibilities were communicated or documented?

  "chunk_0-28": "Clarify and expand on the incomplete question. Request that opposing counsel finish their question so the record accurately reflects what is being asked, and ensure the witness fully understands before answering.",
  "chunk_0-29": "Ask the witness to clarify\u2014in granular, step-by-step detail\u2014what criteria or protocols are used by contractors to determine whether a car will be re-railed, and who specifically makes or documents that decision at the scene.",
  "chunk_0-30": "Clarify exactly who was responsible for inspecting, maintaining, and certifying the tank car\u2019s pressure release device, and elicit the documented procedures or logs reflecting that oversight to systematically map where accountability for that safety-critical component resides.",
  "chunk_0-31": "I would focus immediately on pinpointing the **exact system or process in place for Norfolk Southern (NS) to receive and review tank car certification data and discrepancy reports\u2014if any\u2014before, during, and after an incident**. \n\nMy next step would be:\n\n\"Can you walk me through, step by step, NS's process or system\u2014whether it's a database, a manual log, or communications protocol\u2014for identifying, recording, and escalating discrepancies between AAR forms and actual tank car characteristics?

  "chunk_0-39": "I would immediately and empathetically clarify the question by asking: \"Could you specify which decision or factual conclusion you're referring to, so we can identify exactly what evidence supported it?\" This refocuses the exchange, ensures the witness isn't trapped by ambiguity, and creates a record that demands the other side define the parameters\u2014setting up a scene-painting, fact-tracing discussion rooted in concrete evidence rather than assumptions."
