My name is Chris Ritona.\nI'm the videographer with Golkow\nLitigation Services.\nToday's date is November 3,\nand the time is approximately\na.m. Eastern.\nThis video deposition is being\nheld in Washington, DC, at WilmerHale,\nPennsylvania Avenue, in the\nmatter of the East Palestine Train\nDerailment, US District Court for the\nNorthern District of Ohio, Eastern\nDivision, Case Number\nCV-00242-BYP.\nAnd the deponent today is David\nDixon.\nAll counsels' appearances will\nbe noted upon the stenographic record.\nThe court reporter today is\nCarrie Campbell, and she will now\nplease swear in the witness.\nDAVID DIXON,\nof lawful age, having been first duly sworn\nPage 10\nto tell the truth, the whole truth and\nnothing but the truth, deposes and says on\nbehalf of the Plaintiffs, as follows:\nDIRECT EXAMINATION\nQUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:\nQ.   All right. Good morning,\nMr. Dixon.\nA.   Good morning.\nQ.   My name is Roger Denton. I\nthink we shook hands briefly before the\ndeposition. I represent the group of\nresidents in East Palestine involving the\nNorfolk Southern train derailment that\nhappened on February 3, 2023.\nDo you understand that?\nA.   I do.",
  "Q.   Okay. We served a notice of",
  "deposition on Norfolk Southern and requested",
  "that they provide a witness to testify on",
  "behalf of the corporation, that would be the",
  "Norfolk Southern Railway and the Norfolk",
  "Southern corporation, concerning certain",
  "topics that were in our notice of deposition.\nAnd you're the person that they have\nPage 326\nany of the derailed VCM cars.\nRight?\nA.   They had input with their\nthoughts with respect to polymerization.\nQ.   Now, no one from Trinity\nprovided any input or advised on whether a\nvent and burn operation should be performed\non the derailed VCM cars.\nRight?\nA.   I don't have any information\nthat says that Trinity provided any input.\nQ.   So based on your knowledge as a",
  "corporate representative of Norfolk Southern,",
  "Trinity had no input on whether to perform",
  "the vent and burn operation.\nTrue?\nA.   Again, I don't have any\ninformation that claims Trinity had any input\non any of the rail cleanup.\nQ.   Okay. So the answer to my\nquestion is, correct, true.\nRight?\nMS. PUJARI: Objection. Asked\nand answered.\nTHE WITNESS: Could you repeat\nPage 328\nthat anyone from Trinity advised on whether\npolymerization was or was not occurring in\nany of the derailed VCM cars.\nTrue?\nA.   I haven't seen any, again,\ninformation that Trinity provided.",
  "Q.   Flip a page, please, to",
  "page 17. I want to look at paragraph 81.\nAre you there?\nA.   I'm there.",
  "Q.   Paragraph 81 reads, \"Following",
  "a tank car derailment and fire, responders\ntypically have four options.\"\nDo you see that?\nA.   I see that.\nQ.   So focusing to begin on the",
  "first option, it says, \"First, responders can",
  "re-rail the tank car and move it to the next",
  "destination if they determine there is no",
  "tank damage.\"\nDo you see that?\nA.   I do see that.",
  "Q.   And at some point in time,",
  "re-railing one or more of the vinyl chloride",
  "cars was something that unified command\nPage 329\nconsidered.\nRight?\nA.   Yes. I would say that they did\nconsider that.\nQ.   Yeah.",
  "And the folks at Norfolk",
  "Southern and at SPSI and at SRS, they helped",
  "advise on that, didn't they?\nA.   I would assume, again,\neverybody on that team was looking through\neach one of these options.\nQ.   Okay. Now, focused on Norfolk",
  "Southern and its contractors that it hired,",
  "would Norfolk Southern consider re-railing a",
  "tank car that it determined was not stable?\nA.   No.\nMS. PUJARI: Objection.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:\nQ.   Why not?\nA.   For safety reasons.",
  "Q.   Would Norfolk Southern or its",
  "contractors consider re-railing a car if that",
  "tank car's pressure release device was not",
  "functioning properly?\nA.   Again, if you're having a\nPage 358\nMr. Keltz, I believe, right?\nA.   I believe that was the FRA\nrepresentative.\nQ.   Okay. Other than that analysis\nby the FRA or Mr. Keltz and any documents\nthey might have created or testimony they\ngave, did Norfolk Southern do any independent\nanalysis into any discrepancies between the\nAAR form and the actual car?\nA.   I'm not aware of any Norfolk\nSouthern employees looking at -- looking at\nthe actual characteristics versus the\ncertificates of construction.\nQ.   At any time, right?\nA.   I'm not aware -- again, I'm not\naware if it occurred, so it would be anytime,\nbecause, again, I'm not aware that it\noccurred.\nQ.   Right.\nAnd but more focused, certainly\nbetween February 3rd, when the train\nderailed, and February 6th, when the vent and\nburn was executed, nobody at Norfolk Southern\nhad any information regarding any so-called\ndiscrepancies between the AAR Form 4-2 and\nPage 359\nthe tank car's actual characteristics.\nCorrect?\nA.   Again, I'm not aware of any - 4  any information that was supplied to NS\nshowing the discrepancies between the actual\ncar characteristics and the certificate of\nconstruction during that time.\nQ.   If you look at the",
  "subparagraph A in paragraph 120, it says,",
  "Trinity Industries Leasing Company's Car 26",
  "has discrepancies between its AAR 4-2",
  "certificate of construction and the tank",
  "car's actual characteristics.\"\nDo you see that?\nA.   I do see that.",
  "Q.   When did anyone from Norfolk",
  "Southern -- well, let me ask it -- let me\nwithdraw that.",
  "What evidence do you rely on in"
