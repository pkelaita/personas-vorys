 5        DIRECT EXAMINATION
 6  QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:
 7     Q.   All right. Good morning,
 8  Mr. Dixon.
 9     A.   Good morning.
10     Q.   My name is Roger Denton. I
11  think we shook hands briefly before the
12  deposition. I represent the group of
13  residents in East Palestine involving the
14  Norfolk Southern train derailment that
15  happened on February 3, 2023.
16        Do you understand that?
17     A.   I do.
18     Q.   Okay. We served a notice of
19  deposition on Norfolk Southern and requested
20  that they provide a witness to testify on
21  behalf of the corporation, that would be the
22  Norfolk Southern Railway and the Norfolk
23  Southern corporation, concerning certain
24  topics that were in our notice of deposition.
25  And you're the person that they have

                             Page 326
 1  any of the derailed VCM cars.
 2        Right?
 3     A.   They had input with their
 4  thoughts with respect to polymerization.
 5     Q.   Now, no one from Trinity
 6  provided any input or advised on whether a
 7  vent and burn operation should be performed
 8  on the derailed VCM cars.
 9        Right?
10     A.   I don't have any information
11  that says that Trinity provided any input.
12     Q.   So based on your knowledge as a
13  corporate representative of Norfolk Southern,
14  Trinity had no input on whether to perform
15  the vent and burn operation.
16        True?
17     A.   Again, I don't have any
18  information that claims Trinity had any input
19  on any of the rail cleanup.
20     Q.   Okay. So the answer to my
21  question is, correct, true.
22        Right?
23        MS. PUJARI: Objection. Asked
24     and answered.
25        THE WITNESS: Could you repeat

```

```
                             Page 328
 1  that anyone from Trinity advised on whether
 2  polymerization was or was not occurring in
 3  any of the derailed VCM cars.
 4        True?
 5     A.   I haven't seen any, again,
 6  information that Trinity provided.
 7     Q.   Flip a page, please, to
 8  page 17. I want to look at paragraph 81.
 9        Are you there?
10     A.   I'm there.
11     Q.   Paragraph 81 reads, "Following
12  a tank car derailment and fire, responders
13  typically have four options."
14        Do you see that?
15     A.   I see that.
16     Q.   So focusing to begin on the
17  first option, it says, "First, responders can
18  re-rail the tank car and move it to the next
19  destination if they determine there is no
20  tank damage."
21        Do you see that?
22     A.   I do see that.
23     Q.   And at some point in time,
24  re-railing one or more of the vinyl chloride
25  cars was something that unified command

                             Page 329
 1  considered.
 2        Right?
 3     A.   Yes. I would say that they did
 4  consider that.
 5     Q.   Yeah.
 6        And the folks at Norfolk
 7  Southern and at SPSI and at SRS, they helped
 8  advise on that, didn't they?
 9     A.   I would assume, again,
10  everybody on that team was looking through
11  each one of these options.
12     Q.   Okay. Now, focused on Norfolk
13  Southern and its contractors that it hired,
14  would Norfolk Southern consider re-railing a
15  tank car that it determined was not stable?
16     A.   No.
17        MS. PUJARI: Objection.
18  QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:
19     Q.   Why not?
20     A.   For safety reasons.
21     Q.   Would Norfolk Southern or its
22  contractors consider re-railing a car if that
23  tank car's pressure release device was not
24  functioning properly?
25     A.   Again, if you're having a

                             Page 358
 1  Mr. Keltz, I believe, right?
 2     A.   I believe that was the FRA
 3  representative.
 4     Q.   Okay. Other than that analysis
 5  by the FRA or Mr. Keltz and any documents
 6  they might have created or testimony they
 7  gave, did Norfolk Southern do any independent
 8  analysis into any discrepancies between the
 9  AAR form and the actual car?
10     A.   I'm not aware of any Norfolk
11  Southern employees looking at -- looking at
12  the actual characteristics versus the
13  certificates of construction.
14     Q.   At any time, right?
15     A.   I'm not aware -- again, I'm not
16  aware if it occurred, so it would be anytime,
17  because, again, I'm not aware that it
18  occurred.
19     Q.   Right.
20        And but more focused, certainly
21  between February 3rd, when the train
22  derailed, and February 6th, when the vent and
23  burn was executed, nobody at Norfolk Southern
24  had any information regarding any so-called
25  discrepancies between the AAR Form 4-2 and

```

-----

```
                             Page 359
 1  the tank car's actual characteristics.
 2        Correct?
 3     A.   Again, I'm not aware of any - 4  any information that was supplied to NS
 5  showing the discrepancies between the actual
 6  car characteristics and the certificate of
 7  construction during that time.
 8     Q.   If you look at the
 9  subparagraph A in paragraph 120, it says,
10  "Trinity Industries Leasing Company's Car 26
11  has discrepancies between its AAR 4-2
12  certificate of construction and the tank
13  car's actual characteristics."
14        Do you see that?
15     A.   I do see that.
16     Q.   When did anyone from Norfolk
17  Southern -- well, let me ask it -- let me
18  withdraw that.
19        What evidence do you rely on in
20  making that allegation?
21     A.   Looking at information from the
22  NTSB, both the Hazardous Materials Group
23  Chair Factual reports and again the FRA's
24  testimony concerning the investigative
25  hearing.
