They breached when you vented\nand burned them on February 6th.\nR i g h t ?\nMS. PETTY: Objection.\nTHE WITNESS: The vent and burn\nwas performed on those cars on\nFebruary 6th because all other options\nto remove product from them were not\navailable to us.\nQUESTIONS BY MR.

BUCHANAN: 15 Q. Right? 16 A. The contractor that performed 17 the vent and burn used shaped explosives and 18 blew holes in the car. 19 Q. So when this chart says that 20 they breached, they breached as a result of 21 the intentional acts of Norfolk Southern's 22 contractor to plant explosives on them to 23 blow them up. 24 MS. PETTY: Objection. 25|\nQUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:\nQ.   Correct?\nMS.

BUCHANAN:\nQ.   Okay. As a factual matter,\nsir, these tanks, the vinyl chloride tank\ncars, that I read into the record a moment\nago that we see on the sheet, those cars were\nbreached when Norfolk Southern's contractor\nplanted explosives and blew them up.\nMS. PETTY: Objection.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:\nQ.   Correct?\nA.   A vent and burn was performed\non the five vinyl chloride cars, but these\ncars had released burning product during the\npool fire incidents.\nQ.

PETTY: Objection.\nTHE WITNESS: Butyl acrylate\nwas released. How much burned, how\nmuch entered the waterway, the ditch\nPage 47 1 product as a matter of the design of the 2 pressure relief device, which is designed to 3 relieve pressure in the tanks. 4 Right? 5 MS. PETTY: Objection. 6 THE WITNESS: There were 7 releases from the PRDs as well as all 8 the other valves on the car. 9 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 10 Q. There are other HAZMAT cars. 11 We talked about the non-HAZMAT cars. We 12 talked about the five that your contractor 13 planted explosives on and blew up, but there 14 are others. 15 Right? 16 MS. PETTY: Objection. 17 THE WITNESS: There were other 18 hazardous materials cars involved in 19 the derailment. 20 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 21 Q. Okay. You had a tank car of 22 isobutylene. 23 Right?

PETTY: Objection. 12 Foundation. 13 THE WITNESS: There were 14 materials from the derailment that 15 reached Sulfur Run and I believe 16 Leslie Run. The quantities of which 17 chemicals it was, I can't answer to 18 that. 19 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 20 Q. Okay. And which materials did 21 you ultimately determine had entered into the 22 creeks, into the waterway? 23 MS. PETTY: Objection. 24 THE WITNESS: Everything that 25 spilled, HAZ and non-HAZ, had the|\npotential of entering the ditch line\nbecause of where the derailment was\nat.\nQUESTIONS BY MR.

And you got this call on Friday\nof the 3rd relating to this train.\nDo you recall that call, sir?\nMS. PETTY: Objection.\nIs there a question?\nMR. BUCHANAN: Yeah, pretty\nclearly.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:\nQ.   Remember the call?\nA.   Yes. I was notified about the\nderailment.\nQ.   Right.\nYou received the consist very\nshortly after the derailment.\nRight?\nA.   I went to our server and\ndownloaded a copy of the consist.\nQ.   Looks like you get it around,\nwhat is that, 9:08 p.m.?\nIs that consistent with your\nmemory, sir?\nPage 51 1 A. That is correct. 2 Q. And two tank cars, benzene 3 residue. 4 Right? 5 A. There were two residue tank 6 cars of benzene involved in the derailment 7 that did not breach. 8 Q. How much benzene was in those 9 cars, sir? 10 MS. PETTY: Objection. 11 THE WITNESS: The residue cars? 12 They're required to be shipped -- 13 residue is an \"iffy\" determination. 14 So it had been emptied to the greatest 15 extent possible.

As a matter of regulation or 19 practice, sir, what's the -- what's the 20 maximum amount you're allowed to still have 21 in a car and still call it residue? 22 A. When the car has been emptied 23 to the greatest extent possible. 24 Q. So we're looking at this report 25 that lists a summary of the derailed cars and|Page 53 1 A.

BUCHANAN: 12 Q. Okay. 13 A. -- which makes the car unsafe 14 to be around. 15 Q. Well, I mean, the PRD -- 16 MR. FUKUMURA: Are you done 17 with your answer? 18 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 19 Q. Oh, I'm sorry. 20 Are you done with your answer? 21 A. Yes. 22 Q. I mean, the PRDs had been going 23 off at various points in time over those two 24 days. 25 Right?|Page 129 1 enough that if the PRDs start going off, you 2 can't be around the cars. 3 Q. You didn't have the 4 understanding, sir, that when the pressure 5 release devices went off, that whenever they 6 went off, that actually has a cooling effect? 7 You didn't have that knowledge, sir? 8 MS. PETTY: Objection. 9 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 10 THE WITNESS: The PRDs in the 11 fire, they operated as they're 12 designed to operate. 13 But we had one of the cars, 14 five and a half hours out of being out 15 of any fire, the PRD went off for like 16 70 minutes. That was one of the first 17 things that alarmed us. The car 18 hadn't been in a pool fire, I believe, 19 for over five and a half hours. 20 So any rise in temperature is a 21 concern to us. 22 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 23 Q.

Yes. 7 Q. So the issue was identified by 8 the Ohio EPA to Norfolk Southern, and 9 notwithstanding Norfolk Southern being made 10 aware of it, remediation measures to prevent 11 it from continuing were ineffective. 12 MS. PETTY: Objection. 13 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 14 Q. Right? 15 A. According to Norfolk -- to Ohio 16 EPA, the containment boom was not holding 17 properly. 18 Q. It says it was in a failing 19 condition. 20 Right? 21 A. Yes, that's what it says. 22 Q. It states, \"Throughout the day, 23 weather conditions prevented vacuum truck 24 recovery of accumulated material, but 25 alternative recovery methods were not|\nutilized to alleviate the buildup at the\ncontainment points, adding to the bypass of\nthe containment measures.\"\nDo you see that?\nA.   I do see that.\nQ.   And is that consistent with\nyour memory of the situation, sir?\nMS. PETTY: Objection.\nTHE WITNESS: I'm not sure what\nalternative recovery methods the\ngentleman is referring to. There were\nvac trucks there.",
  "QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:\nQ.

  "A.   No.\nQ.   So you assume that it was\ndischarging liquid from the PRD solely based\nupon the orientation of the tank car?",
  "Page 243 1 also oriented a little different, too. So it 2 was in a liquid phase to begin with, which is 3 more than likely made the fire worse under -- 4 when it was just jetting, it was throwing 5 liquid out.\" 6 Do you see that testimony? 7 A. Yes. 8 Q. And which car were you 9 referring to when you were talking about the 10 car being in the liquid phase? 11 MR.

BROZ: 18 Q. So would that be OCPX80370? 19 A. Yes. 20 Q. And what is the basis for your 21 understanding that car OCPX80370 was, 22 quote/unquote, in the liquid phase? 23 A. The orientation of the car and 24 the position of the valves on the car, 25 specifically the PRD.|Page 245 1 A. Yes. The base of the PRD would 2 have been in the liquid. 3 Q.

I apologize. Let's go to|\nline 21 of that page.\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   In answer to the question, \"And\nwhat does that do to the pressure relief\ndevice?\" you answered, \"It will operate, but\nit doesn't relieve pressure as fast because\nit's pushing liquid.\"\nDo you see that?\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   Was OCPX80370 in fact pushing\nliquid?\nA.   My belief is yes.\nQ.   Based upon what?\nA.   The position of the PRD.\nQ.   Any other basis to conclude\nthat OCPX80370 was pushing liquid?\nA.   No.\nQ.   Do you have any video evidence\nshowing OCPX80370 pushing liquid out of the\nPRD?\nA.   Just the video of fire coming\nfrom the PRD.\nQ.   Fire and nothing else?\nA.   That's it.\nQ.   Do you have any pictures of it\nQUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:\nQ.   So it's your opinion that once\nmonomer exits from a PRD and reacts with\noxygen, it will automatically polymerize?\nMS. PETTY: Objection.\nTHE WITNESS: It's my\nunderstanding it can.\nQUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:\nQ.   Was the monomer that allegedly\nwas exiting from OCPX80370 polymerizing once\nit met with oxygen outside the vinyl chloride\ntank car?\nMS.

Did you find any polymer -- let\nme strike that.\nDid you find any polymerized\nvinyl chloride outside of OCPX80370 when you\nhad an opportunity to inspect the tank cars?\nA.   I did not inspect the tank\ncars.\nQ.   How about when your responders\ninspected the tank cars?

Nothing else? 7 A. Correct. 8 Q. You never saw liquid? 9 A. Fire. 10 Q. Just fire? 11 A. Yes. 12 Q. Okay. Let's go to line 24. 13 So you say, \"So it's pushing 14 that monomer that wants to polymerize when it 15 gets some oxygen out through the ports.\" 16 Do you see that? 17 A. Yes. 18 Q. What is your basis that the 19 minute the stabilized vinyl chloride that was 20 in OCPX80370 went through the port that it 21 would automatically polymerize? 22 MS. PETTY: Objection. 23 THE WITNESS: The polymer 24 exiting the PRD. Or, excuse me, the 25 monomer exiting the PRD.|Page 249 1 OCPX80370? 2 A. No, just evidence of fire. 3 Q. Do you have any evidence -- or 4 let me strike that. 5 Based upon your knowledge, were 6 the PRDs activating properly in the five tank 7 cars containing vinyl chloride? 8 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 9 MS. PETTY: Objection. 10 THE WITNESS: The PR -- the 11 PRDs on the five vinyl chloride cars 12 did operate. 13 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 14 Q. You can set that aside. 15 MR.

I believe unified command was.\nThat would have been one of their functions.\nQ.   So these were internal -- these\nincidence status reports were internal\nNorfolk Southern forms?\nA.

It varies by incidents.\nQ.   All right. How about for this\nincident?\nA.   I believe these were being done\ntwice a day, I think, at shift change. I\nthink. Some incidents they're done just\nevery morning. It depends.\nQ.   And when was shift change?\nA.   Generally 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.\nPage 251 1 reports? 2 A. To provide an incident update 3 to NS personnel as well as any regulatory 4 agency that wanted it. 5 Q. And who prepared these incident 6 status reports for Norfolk Southern? 7 A. It would have been one of the 8 HAZMAT managers on -- 9 Q. Do you know who? 10 A. I was responsible for some of 11 them. Jon Simpson would have done some of 12 them. Probably most of them were done by Jon 13 Simpson, I think. 14 Q. Do you know which ones you 15 prepared as compared to which ones 16 Mr. Simpson prepared? 17 A. I do not recall. 18 Q. If you look at the top of -- 19 I'm going to go by Bates numbers -- NS-CA, 20 and the last three digits are 572. 21 Do you see at the bottom corner 22 there? 23 A. Uh-huh. 24 Q. Okay. Can you go to the top of 25 that page?|Page 253 1 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. 2 Q. Do you know why this one is 3 labeled 7 p.m. to 7 a.m.? 4 A. That's generally when 5 operational periods are, and you have an 6 overlap in personnel. 7 Q. So at the end of an operational 8 period, you'll complete an incident status 9 report? 10 A. Correct. Someone will. 11 Q. And you will do that every 12 12 hours? 13 A. On some incidents. 14 Q. How about this incident? 15 A. I believe so. At least for a 16 period of time. 17 Q. You believe that one was 18 created every 12 hours? 19 A. I believe. 20 Q. Do you know whether you 21 prepared what we've marked as Deposition 22 Exhibit 18? 23 A. I do not. 24 Q. Is there a way of telling who 25 prepared this form?|\nA.   I don't think so.\nQ.   Where do you go -- let me start\nthat again.\nIs there a computer system that\nyou go to to complete these forms at the end\nof a shift change?\nA.   This is just a Word document.\nQ.   And where is the Word document\nstored?\nA.   Before or after?\nQ.   After you're done completing\nit.\nA.   I think everything from East\nPalestine went to the server file for the -15    Q.

Okay. And if you could turn to 25 Bates number 336.|Page 257 1 that we previously marked as Deposition 2 Exhibit 18, that the vinyl chloride was in 3 situ? 4 A. Yes. 5 Q. Earlier today, I believe you 6 testified that vinyl chloride was being 7 released from the other valves of the vinyl 8 chloride cars? 9 A. Yes. 10 Q. And what is your basis for that 11 understanding? 12 A. Visible burning from around the 13 valves. 14 Q. So we're back to the fire 15 again? 16 A. Yes. 17 Q. Any other reason to conclude 18 that liquid vinyl chloride was leaking from 19 any of the valves contained on the tank cars? 20 A. It's reasonable to conclude 21 that that's vinyl chloride burning. 22 Q. I understand you're concluding 23 it's vinyl chloride, but what is your basis 24 to conclude that liquid vinyl chloride was 25 released -- was leaking from the valves in|\nthe tank cars?\nA.   I said vinyl chloride was.\nQ.   But not liquid?\nA.   I don't know.\nQ.   So you're changing your\ntestimony from earlier today where you\ntestified that liquid vinyl chloride was\nleaking from the valves in the tank cars?\nMS. PETTY: Objection.\nMR. FUKUMURA: Objection.\nTHE WITNESS: No.\nWhat was stated in the record\nhere and otherwise is we believed it\nwas liquid vinyl chloride burning out\nof the PRD due to the position of it.\nThe possibility exists,\ndepending on where the fire is coming\nfrom the valves, it could be liquid,\nit could be vapors. We don't know.\nQUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:\nQ.   I think let's go a step back.\nWhat is your basis for\nunderstanding that vinyl chloride, liquid or\notherwise, was releasing from anything other\nthan the PRDs?\nfactual report which we've marked as\nExhibit 3?\nMS. PETTY: Objection.\nTHE WITNESS: Yes.\nQUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:\nQ.   And that wasn't included in\nthere.\nCorrect?\nA.   I don't recall whether it was\nfrom me. I believe it was from somebody\nelse.\nQ.   Where is that in this document?\nA.   I don't know. I could go look.\nQ.   We can go off the record and\nyou can look -- you can look all you want.\nA.   Okay.\nMS. BROZ: Okay. Let's go off\nthe record.\nVIDEOGRAPHER: We are now going\noff the video record. The time is",
  "currently 2:08 p.m.\nOff the record at 2:08 p.m.)\nVIDEOGRAPHER: We are now back\non the video record. The time is\ncurrently 2:19 p.m.\nPage 259 1 A. The visible fires burning. 2 Q. Is it possible that the fires 3 were burning as a result of reacting with 4 some other chemical other than vinyl 5 chloride? 6 MS. PETTY: Objection. 7 THE WITNESS: No, I don't 8 believe so. 9 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 10 Q. Other than the fires, did you 11 see vinyl chloride leaking from anything else 12 other than the P -- let me take that back. 13 Let me start my question again. 14 Other than the fires, do you 15 have any other evidence that vinyl chloride 16 was leaking from any other of the valves on 17 the vinyl chloride tank cars? 18 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 19 THE WITNESS: No. 20 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 21 Q. And if you believe that, in 22 fact, vinyl chloride was leaking from the 23 valves on the vinyl chloride tank cars, you 24 would have the opportunity to include that 25 fact in the hazardous materials group chair|Page 261 1 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 2 Q. Mr. Wood, we went off the 3 record for about ten minutes to give you the 4 opportunity to review Wood Deposition 5 Exhibit 3. 6 Correct? 7 MR. FUKUMURA: For the record, 8 this is 159-page document. 9 MS. BROZ: The document speaks 10 for itself, Counsel. No speaking 11 objections. 12 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 13 Q. Did you have an opportunity to 14 review Wood Deposition Exhibit 3? 15 A. Yes. Part of it. 16 Q. And would you like to go off 17 the record again to continue to review Wood 18 Deposition 3? 19 A. No. 20 MS. PETTY: We're not going off 21 the record again. If you want to use 22 your time like this, that's fine, but 23 it will count to your time. 24 MS. BROZ: I note for the 25 record that the -- your opportunity to|\nreview the document was restricted by\nyour counsel and not by me.\nMS. PETTY: Objection.\nQUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:\nQ.   And I believe that the reason\nthat we went off the record was for you to\nfind the citation in Wood Deposition\nExhibit 3 where it states that the valves\nwere leaking vinyl chloride in the five vinyl\nchloride railcars.\nDid you find that citation?\nA.   The first instance of a -13 dealing with an angle valve is on .66.\nQ.   And on .66, does it say\nanything about that valve leaking vinyl\nchloride after the derailment?\nA.   It says, \"The teardown of the\nangle valve, the Midland manufacturing model\nA720-0X-CVGFS, Serial Number GE-022-RA, found\nthe valve stem seal was heat-damaged and\nmissing and the gasket was heat-damaged.\"\nQ.   And did you find anything in\nwhat we've marked as Deposition Exhibit 3\nstating that the valve, in fact, was leaking?\nA.   Just that the valve gasket was\nBLEVE model by 08:00 on conference call\nsourced by Norfolk Southern.\"\nDo you see that?\nA.   I do see that.\nQ.   Do you know why \"requested\" is\nin quotes?\nA.   I do not.\nQ.   And was Occidental's request\nfor a BLEVE model relayed to you?\nA.   It may have been. I don't\nrecall.\nQ.   Did you in fact receive a BLEVE\nmodel?\nA.   I did not.\nQ.   You did not.\nWood Exhibit 19 marked for\nidentification.)\nQUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:\nQ.   19?\nSo we're going to mark the next\nexhibit as Deposition Exhibit 19, which is an\ne-mail with an attachment, and we're going to\nput those together to make one exhibit.\nMR. FUKUMURA: Can you give us\ntwo copies unless we're going to have\nPage 263 1 no longer there. 2 Q. And that's it? 3 A. Yes. 4 Q. Okay.

It appears to be a theoretic 25 outcome of a BLEVE.|Page 269 1 Q. Were you concerned about the 2 possibility of a BLEVE happening? 3 A. Yes. 4 Q. And what did -- who did you 5 relay that concern to? 6 A. The incident commander, 7 initially. 8 Q. And did you ask anyone to 9 prepare a model? 10 A. I did not. 11 Q. You did not? 12 A. I did not. 13 Q. Why would John T. Wilson be 14 sending you a copy of a BLEVE model on 15 February 5th if you didn't ask for it? 16 MS. PETTY: Objection. 17 THE WITNESS: More than likely 18 due to me being on site at the time. 19 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 20 Q. Any other reason? 21 A. I'm a representative from NS. 22 Q. You see that you're the only 23 one copied on the e-mail from John T. Wilson? 24 A. I do see that. 25 Q. And you never reviewed this?|\nA.   I don't recall ever reviewing\nthis.\nQ.

And what would cause the 4 internal overpressurization? 5 A. We believe the cars were 6 p o ly m e r iz in g . 7 Q. Is there anything else, other 8 than the possibility of the five vinyl 9 chloride cars polymerizing, that would cause 10 internal overpressurization? 11 A. The product being in pool fires 12 would cause it to overpressurize. Failure of 13 the car can be due to pressurization combined 14 with damage to the tank in the derailment. 15 So there are multiple factors that go into 16 it . 17 Q. The pool fires would cause the 18 tank car to heat up. 19 C o r r e c t ? 20 A. Yes. 21 Q. When the tank car is heated up, 22 the PRDs would activate? 23 A. Yes. 24 Q.

Mr. Wood, when we broke, we|\nwere looking at Deposition Exhibit 21, Bates\nnumber ending 1936.\nAre you still there?\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   And you testified, I believe,\nand please correct me if I'm wrong, that you\ncalled the demo experts at 5 p.m. on\nFebruary 5th to ask them to come to East\nP a l e s t i n e ?\nA.   I did not contact them. Chip\nDay with SRS actually contacted them.\nQ.   Were you on that phone call\nwith him?\nA.   No.\nQ.   Did you tell him to contact\nt h e m ?\nA.   I did.\nQ.   And why did you tell him to\ncontact them?\nA.   Because we believed\npolymerization was going on in the vinyl\nchloride tank cars and that we were going to\nneed to perform a vent and burn.\nQ.   And did you have Chip Day\ncontact the demo experts before or after you\ncan someone just tell how much, if\nany, time has been ceded to counsel\nfor Oxy?\nMS. BROZ: Not a specific\namount of time, but they have ceded\ntheir time to me.\nMS. PETTY: Okay.\nQUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:\nQ.   Are you there?\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   Okay. And if you turn to -12 we're now referring to the numbers in the top\nright-hand corner, the .2?\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   And these were temperature\nreadings that were recorded on the\nspreadsheet that was maintained by Norfolk\nS o u t h e r n .\nC o r r e c t ?\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   And if I'm reading this\ncorrectly, and I don't do it well with\nmilitary time, 15:30 is 3:30 p.m.?\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   And that's on February 6th?\nPage 291 1 spoke with Chief Drabick? 2 A. It would have been right about 3 the same time. 4 Q. You know it's impossible to do 5 two things at once, so was it before or 6 a f t e r ? 7 A. We had the discussion right 8 outside the fire station before I walked in 9 and talked to the chief. 10 Q. You and Chip Day had the 11 discussion outside the fire station to call 12 the demo experts before you talked to Chief 13 D r a b ic k ? 14 A. Yes. 15 Q. And are these demo experts 16 called Explosive Services International? 17 A. I know them as ESI, but I think 18 that's what it stands for. 19 Q. Let's go back to what was 20 previously marked as Deposition Exhibit 9, 21 p le a s e . 22 MR. FUKUMURA: It's the chart. 23 THE WITNESS: Yeah, it's -- 24 MS. PETTY: Counsel, while 25 everyone is looking for the document,|Page 293 1 A. Yes. 2 Q. And the vinyl chloride car that 3 you were most concerned about, OCPX80370, had 4 dropped 126 degrees. 5 Is that correct? 6 MS. PETTY: Objection. 7 THE WITNESS: The temperature 8 readings we were getting from the 9 surface of the tank were 126 degrees. 10 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 11 Q. Is there any temperature 12 reading at which you would have called off 13 the vent and burn operation? 14 MS. PETTY: Objection. 15 THE WITNESS: The discussion 16 about if the temperature approached 17 185 degrees. 18 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 19 Q. Let me put it the other way. 20 The temperature is going down. 21 Correct? 22 MS. PETTY: Objection. 23 THE WITNESS: The temperature 24 was 126 at 14:30, yes. 25|\nQUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:\nQ.   And that is lower than it was\nrecorded at any time prior?\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   Is there a temperature reading\nthat you would have obtained from OCPX80370\nthat would have caused you to call off the\nvent and burn operation on February 6th?\nMR. FUKUMURA: Objection.\nMS. PETTY: Objection. Form.\nTHE WITNESS: I know of no\ndiscussion about a low-end\ntemperature, no.\nQUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:\nQ.

Mr. Wood, I've handed you what\nwe've marked as Deposition Exhibit 22 and ask\nyou if you recognize that.\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   And what is it?\nA.   It's the instructions provided\nto NS on how the protective housings and\npressure plates were to be removed from the\nvinyl chloride cars.\nQ.   Did you have any say in how the\npressure plates or valve assemblies were to\nbe removed -16        MR. FUKUMURA: Objection.\nQUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:\nQ.   -- from the vinyl chloride\ncars?\nMR. FUKUMURA: Objection.\nTHE WITNESS: No, other than\nwhat type of equipment we would have\nto use to remove them.\nQUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:\nQ.
