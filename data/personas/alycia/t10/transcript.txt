1    Q.   All right. My name's Dave
2 Buchanan. I represent, you know, folks in
3 East Palestine and elsewhere that have been
4 impacted by that derailment.
5        I take it you're not surprised
6 to find yourself in that chair today.
7        Are you, sir?

19    people displaced as a result of the
20    derailment. I do know that.
21 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
22    Q.   Pretty significant event.
23        Fair to say?

1    Norfolk Southern has never had to
2    perform a vent and burn on any
3    i n c i d e n t .
4 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
5    Q.   So I guess the answer to my
6 question would be they've never had to do a
7 vent and burn with regard to vinyl chloride
8 monomer before.
9        R i g h t ?
10        MR. FUKUMURA: Objection.
11    Asked and answered. Foundation.
12 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:

15 never had to conduct a vent and burn on any
16 c a r .
17    Q.   At the time of the derailment,
18 sir, you were the systems manager for
19 hazardous materials at Norfolk Southern.
20        Is that right?
21    A.   That's correct.
22    Q.   You had that role since 2019?
23    A.   Yes.
24    Q.   And before that, am I right you

PETTY: Objection. 24 You can answer, if you know. 25 THE WITNESS: To my knowledge,|Page 13 1 at Norfolk Southern? 2 A. That's correct. 3 Q . From about 2012 to 2019? 4 A. That's correct. 5 Q. Okay. Now if I understand it 6 correctly, in May of 2023 you received a 7 p r o m o t io n . 8 Is that right? 9 A. That's correct. 10 Q. And you're now the director of 11 hazardous materials? 12 A. That is correct. 13 Q . And you're responsible for 14 emergency response and preparedness. 15 Is that right? 16 A . I manage the Norfolk Southern 17 emergency response and preparedness program. 18 Q.

PETTY: Objection. 22 THE WITNESS: That was true. 23 That was one of my duties at the time. 24 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 25 Q. Am I correct, sir, you managed|
|---|---|


-----

1 at that point in time a team of, what is it,
2 eight regional managers and HAZMAT managers?
3    A.   At that time it was a team of
4 two regional managers, and the rest were
5 HAZMAT managers.
6    Q.   And you reported to an
7 individual named David Schoendorfer.
8        Is that right?
9    A.   That is correct.
10    Q.   As of that point in time?
11    A.   That's correct.
12    Q.   He was the director of
13 environmental for Norfolk Southern.
14        Is that correct?
15    A.   That is correct.
16    Q.   You no longer report to
17 Mr. Schoendorfer?
18    A.   Mr. Schoendorfer has retired.
19    Q.   Do you know when he was asked
20 to retire -21        MS. PETTY: Objection.
22 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
23    Q.   -- following the derailment of
24 Train 32N, sir?
25        MS. PETTY: Objection. Lack of


1 Southern's perspective, he was the incident
2 commander from the 6th until the time of his
3 departure from the scene?
4    A.   He was the incident commander
5 for Norfolk Southern for the site starting -6 it wouldn't have been on the 6th because Dave
7 Gooden was still the incident command rep for
8 Norfolk Southern at the time.
9    Q.   All right. Why don't we -10 we'll get into some greater detail on all
11 this as we go, but since we're on it now, who
12 was the incident commander for Norfolk
13 Southern on site on February 3rd, that
14 Friday, if anyone?
15    A.   Kraig Barner and Dave Gooden
16 were both there, I believe.
17    Q.   And who had that role or
18 function or title, sir?
19        MS. PETTY: Objection.
20 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
21    Q.   Of incident commander for
22 Norfolk Southern.
23    A.   For Norfolk Southern, it would
24 have been Kraig Barner when he got there.
25    Q.   And was there another incident
|Page 15 1 foundation. Assumes facts. 2 THE WITNESS: I don't know why 3 Mr. Schoendorfer retired. 4 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 5 Q. You weren't aware that he was 6 asked to retire? 7 MS. PETTY: Objection. 8 Foundation. 9 THE WITNESS: I was not. 10 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 11 Q. Did he have some role and 12 involvement, sir, in East Palestine? 13 MS. PETTY: Objection. Vague. 14 THE WITNESS: Yes. He was 15 involved in the response to East 16 Palestine. He served as incident 17 commander at one point for Norfolk 18 Southern. 19 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 20 Q. At what point in time? 21 A. He was -- if I can remember 22 correctly, he was there, I think, on the 6th, 23 and then when he -- when he departed from the 24 site, I can't -- I can't remember. 25 Q. Okay. So from Norfolk|Page 17 1 commander for Norfolk Southern between that 2 Friday and Monday when Mr. Schoendorfer 3 became Norfolk Southern's incident commander 4 at the site? 5 A. I don't recall the date 6 Mr. Schoendorfer took over incident command 7 responsibilities. I don't believe it was the 8 6th. He was there, but so was Mr. Barner. 9 Q. Okay. And so as best you 10 recall, sir, Mr. Barner, excuse me, was the 11 incident commander for Norfolk Southern from 12 the 3rd until a point in time when 13 Mr. Schoendorfer became the incident 14 commander for Norfolk Southern at the site. 15 Is that right? 16 A. At some point in time it would 17 have been himself or Dave Gooden. 18 Q. What's the sequence as you 19 remember it, sir, between those three 20 individuals? 21 A. I do not know whether Dave 22 Gooden or Kraig Barner arrived on the scene 23 first on the 3rd. Whichever one arrived 24 first, they would have been the senior 25 transportation officer who would have been|
|---|---|


-----

1 the incident commander for Norfolk Southern's
2 portion.
3    Q.   Okay. And then that person
4 would have stayed in that role until a
5 transition to Mr. Schoendorfer?
6        MS. PETTY: Objection.
7 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
8    Q.   Just trying to understand, sir.
9    A.   There would have been a senior
10 transportation officer serving as incident
11 commander. I believe Dave Gooden would have
12 been who passed it on to Mr. Schoendorfer. I
13 believe.
14    Q.   Okay. There's been a number of
15 folks who have testified in the last several
16 weeks relating -- in the litigation setting,
17 sir, relating to this particular derailment.
18        You're aware of that?
19    A.   Yes.
20    Q.   Have you had communications
21 with any of them about their testimony, sir?
22    A.   No.
23    Q.   Have you had communications
24 with anyone about your testimony today?
25        MS. PETTY: Objection.


1        We have day-to-day work that
2    we're still doing on site that I talk
3    with contractors.
4 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
5    Q.   We talked briefly about you
6 ultimately arrive on scene in East Palestine.
7        Correct, sir?
8    A.   I arrived on site Saturday, the
9 4 t h .
10    Q.   And you're involved, obviously,
11 with a lot of the activities that happen over
12 the period of time after you arrive.
13        Fair, sir?
14        MS. PETTY: Objection.
15        THE WITNESS: I was part of
16    operations going on at the site.
17 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
18    Q.   You were part of operations -19 I'm sorry, I missed that word.
20    A.   Emergency response operations
21 on the site with our contractors.
22    Q.   Understood.
23        There was a vent and burn that
24 was conducted on February 6th.
25        Do you recall that?
|Page 19 1 You can answer to the extent it 2 doesn't require you to disclose any 3 communications with counsel. 4 MR. BUCHANAN: I don't care 5 about the content if you were speaking 6 to counsel, but I do want to know 7 whether you were or were not. 8 THE WITNESS: Yes, I have 9 spoken with NS counsel. 10 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 11 Q. Anybody other than NS counsel, 12 sir? 13 A. NS's outside counsel and my 14 counsel. 15 Q. How about folks who were 16 involved in the aftermath of the derailment - 17 Norfolk Southern's response, its contractors, 18 et cetera? 19 MS. PETTY: Objection. 20 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 21 Q. Have you spoken to any of them? 22 MS. PETTY: Objection to the 23 form. 24 THE WITNESS: Not with regard 25 to any deposition.|Page 21 1 A. Yes. 2 Q. You said first time you'd ever 3 been a part of a vent and burn operation. 4 R ig h t ? 5 A. That's correct. 6 Q. First time Norfolk Southern had 7 ever been a part of a vent and burn operation 8 with vinyl chloride. 9 R ig h t ? 10 MS. PETTY: Objection. Asked 11 and answered. 12 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 13 Q. You can answer. 14 A. That was the -- again, to my 15 knowledge, that was the first vent and burn 16 that Norfolk Southern had ever had to 17 c o n d u c t . 18 Q. On anything? 19 A. On anything. 20 Q. You provided an interview to 21 the NTSB on February 8th. 22 Do you recall that, sir? 23 A.

18    A.   Yes.
19    Q.   You had a chance to read it, I
20 guess, after it happened?
21    A.   I did review it, yes.
22    Q.   In providing that statement to
23 the NTSB, sir, I take it you tried to be
24 truthful and accurate?
25    A.   Yes.


1    Q.   To the best of your knowledge,
2 sir, you certainly didn't formally provide
3 any further information on this interview

24    Q.   There's also cars listed here
25 that are not classified as HAZMAT.


1    Q.   I'm using line numbers for the
2 cars, but there can be some confusion using
3 line numbers.
4        Right?
5        MS. PETTY: Objection.
6        THE WITNESS: No, you should be
7    using the car numbers. That's what we
8    teach.
9 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
10    Q.   Okay. So GPLX 74465, that's a
11 polyethylene hopper car, not classified as

14        MS. PETTY: Objection.
15        MR. FUKUMURA: Objection.
16        THE WITNESS: I don't -- I
17    don't recall whether -- not all of the

19    burned; some didn't. I would have to
20    go back and review David's reports to
21    see.
22 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
23    Q.   Okay. Maybe we'll have a
24 chance to look at those today.
25        Three cars of propylene glycol.

PETTY: Objection. 17 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 18 Q. Two hopper cars up top, 25 and 19 26? 20 A. Yes. 21 Q. And I'm using line number, but 22 there can be some confusion using car numbers 23 that way. 24 Right, sir? 25 A. I'm sorry, I don't --|Page 37 1 Do you see those, also 2 breached? 3 A. Again, this -- going through, 4 there were several propylene glycols in here. 5 I have to see how many were breached. 6 Q. We'll have a chance to look at 7 the actual damage assessment, I think, a 8 little later today, sir. 9 Just satisfy yourself that 10 there was propylene glycol, or a car of 11 propylene glycol, at least, that breached. 12 True? 13 MS. PETTY: Objection. 14 THE WITNESS: That is correct. 15 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 16 Q. Okay. There was one car of 17 ethylene glycol monobutyl ether that 18 breached? 19 A. Yes. 20 Q.

5 to.
6    A.   There were several PVC cars
7 involved and hopper cars involved in the
8 accident. I don't -- I don't remember
9 exactly how many breached and how many just
10 burned or how many were not damaged.
11    Q.   You are aware, sir, that
12 there -- they did burn.

22 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
23    Q.   You had three cars of petroleum
24 lube oil breached.
25        Right?


1 that mean?
2    A.   I'm sorry -3    Q.   What does breached mean when
4 we're talking about cars and their contents
5 in the context of a derailment?
6    A.   The actual tank shell of the
7 car was opened up and allowed product to
8 r e l e a s e .
9    Q.   Not a good thing?

19    Q.   And these are the cars that are
20 not classified as HAZMAT.
21        Right?
22        MS. PETTY: Objection.
23        THE WITNESS: The polyethylene,
24    the polyvinyl chloride, the petroleum
25    lube oil and those glycols are not,

2 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
3    Q.   You're not surprised to hear,

5 carcinogenic.
6        That doesn't surprise you, does
7 it, sir?
8        MS. PETTY: Objection.
9        THE WITNESS: I'm not familiar
10    with the carcinogenic properties of
11    PAHs. That's a whole family of
12    chemicals.

24 m a t e r i a l s .
25        Five tank cars of vinyl


1 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
2    Q.   Okay. So the cars themselves,
3 sir, did not breach in the derailment.
4        C o r r e c t ?
5        MS. PETTY: Objection. Asked
6    and answered.
7        THE WITNESS:  The vinyl
8    chloride cars did not breach in the
9    a c c i d e n t .
10 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
11    Q.   They breached when you vented
12 and burned them on February 6th.
13        R i g h t ?
14        MS. PETTY: Objection.
15        THE WITNESS: The vent and burn
16    was performed on those cars on
17    February 6th because all other options
18    to remove product from them were not
19    available to us.
20 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
21    Q.   We'll get a chance to talk
22 about that today. I just want to understand
23 the facts, sir.
24        They did not breach in the
25 d e r a i l m e n t .
|Page 43 1 chloride monomer, 28, 29, 30, 31 and 55. 2 That's, what, TILX402025, 3 OCPX80235, OCPX80179, GATX95098, and 4 OCPX80370, vinyl chloride stabilizer. 5 Do you see those, sir? 6 A. Yes. 7 Q. And they weren't breached in 8 the derailment. 9 R ig h t ? 10 MS. PETTY: Objection. 11 THE WITNESS: The tank shells 12 were not breached, but the cars vented 13 from the PRDs and burned during the 14 w r e c k . 15 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 16 Q. And that acronym we'll probably 17 have a chance to talk about today. That's a 18 pressure relief -- pressure release device? 19 A. A pressure relief device, yes. 20 Q. Okay. And pressure relief 21 devices are designed to vent product as 22 pressure builds. 23 R ig h t ? 24 MS. PETTY: Objection. 25 THE WITNESS: That's correct.|Page 45 1 C o r r e c t ? 2 MS. PETTY: Objection. Asked 3 and answered. 4 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 5 Q. Right, sir? 6 A. The vinyl chloride cars did not 7 breach in the accident. 8 Q. They breached when Norfolk 9 Southern's contractor blew them up. 10 MS. PETTY: Objection. 11 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 12 Q. Intentionally. 13 MS. PETTY: Objection. 14 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 15 Q. Right? 16 A. The contractor that performed 17 the vent and burn used shaped explosives and 18 blew holes in the car. 19 Q. So when this chart says that 20 they breached, they breached as a result of 21 the intentional acts of Norfolk Southern's 22 contractor to plant explosives on them to 23 blow them up. 24 MS. PETTY: Objection. 25|

1 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
2    Q.   Correct?
3        MS. PETTY: Objection.
4        THE WITNESS: No, this column
5    in the chart lists whether material
6    was released from them either from a
7    breach or either from being burned.
8    That's what this spreadsheet
9    indicates.
10 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
11    Q.   Okay. As a factual matter,
12 sir, these tanks, the vinyl chloride tank
13 cars, that I read into the record a moment
14 ago that we see on the sheet, those cars were
15 breached when Norfolk Southern's contractor
16 planted explosives and blew them up.
17        MS. PETTY: Objection.
18 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
19    Q.   Correct?
20    A.   A vent and burn was performed
21 on the five vinyl chloride cars, but these
22 cars had released burning product during the
23 pool fire incidents.
24    Q.   When you say they "released
25 burning product," they released burning


1        Right? Car 50?

13        THE WITNESS: Material
14    eventually entered the ditch lines
15    along the railroad tracks, yes.
16 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
17    Q.   And just to make sure that we
18 have a clean record, when you say "material,"
19 you're aware that butyl acrylates entered the
20 waterway there.
21        Right?
22        MS. PETTY: Objection.
23        THE WITNESS: Butyl acrylate
24    was released. How much burned, how
25    much entered the waterway, the ditch
|Page 47 1 product as a matter of the design of the 2 pressure relief device, which is designed to 3 relieve pressure in the tanks. 4 Right? 5 MS. PETTY: Objection. 6 THE WITNESS: There were 7 releases from the PRDs as well as all 8 the other valves on the car. 9 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 10 Q.

I am a member of the AAR HAZMAT 20 committee, along with all the Class I 21 railroads who developed the AskRail app, and 22 we monitor the usage of it, especially during 23 an emergency. 24 Q. And so when did you get that 25 information?|Page 69 1 scene shortly after you got word about the 2 derailment? 3 A. Yes. Yes. 4 Q. He was, what, one of the 5 closest people to the scene? 6 A. Yes.

4        THE WITNESS: I believe that is
5    correct.
6 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
7    Q.   Right. I take it you're not on
8 the ground at that point, but you defer to
9 Mr. Deutsch in terms of his observations and
10 experience there?
11    A.   Yes.
12    Q.   So is it correct, sir, that -13 or at least you understand that Mr. Deutsch
14 directed the firefighters to withdraw from
15 the area?
16    A.   Yes.
17    Q.   And to stop all fire
18 suppression activities.
19        Right?
20    A.   I don't know that he instructed
21 them to stop fire suppression activities. He
22 told them to remove personnel. They may have
23 still been running unmanned -- unmanned
24 master streams. I don't know.

1        THE WITNESS: I'm not aware of
2    that.
3 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
4    Q.   Would you defer to Mr. Deutsch,
5 I guess, and his recollection and testimony
6 on that?
7    A.   Yes.
8    Q.   And Mr. Deutsch, I take it he
9 reached out to contractors to assist in the
10 fire suppression activities.
11        Right?
12        MS. PETTY: Objection.
13        THE WITNESS: Mr. Deutsch would
14    have engaged contractors to come -15 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
16    Q.   Right.
17    A.   -- as part of a response.
18    Q.   You have that knowledge, do you
19 not, sir, that Mr. Deutsch reached out to
20 SPSI, among others, in connection with
21 mobilizing Norfolk Southern's response at the
22 derailment site?
23    A.   Yes.
24    Q.   But even though Norfolk
25 Southern brought in contractors, ultimately
|Page 75 1 instructed to stop all fire suppression 2 activities at some point in that February 3rd 3 to February 4th time frame. 4 Correct? 5 MS. PETTY: Objection. 6 THE WITNESS: I was told that 7 the firefighters were told to egress 8 from the site. 9 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 10 Q. You're not aware that it was 11 Mr. Deutsch's recommendation that the fire 12 protection personnel pull back and cease 13 engaging in other fire suppression 14 activities? 15 MS. PETTY: Objection. 16 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 17 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 18 Q. Not aware of that? 19 A. Yes. Scott Deutsch said the 20 firemen need to be removed from where they 21 were at because they were -- their safety. 22 Q. Not aware that he also told 23 them to cease engaging in other fire 24 suppression activities? 25 MS. PETTY: Objection.|Page 77 1 it was Norfolk Southern -- Norfolk Southern's 2 responsibility to approve the decisions made 3 in the derailment site. 4 Right? 5 MS. PETTY: Objection. 6 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 7 THE WITNESS: No. The ultimate 8 decisions have to come from the 9 incident commander. 10 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 11 Q. Isn't it true, sir, that 12 ultimately anything done on one of Norfolk 13 Southern's derailment sites has to meet 14 Norfolk Southern's approval? 15 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 16 MS. PETTY: Objection. 17 THE WITNESS: When we're 18 working a site under a unified 19 command, unified command and the 20 incident commander ultimately has 21 decision-making abilities. 22 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 23 Q. Let's take a look at your 24 testimony before the NTSB, sir. 25 Do you have Exhibit 256 before|

4        MS. PETTY: Counsel, are you
5    talking about -- do you mean
6    Exhibit 2? You said 256.
7        MR. BUCHANAN: My apologies. I
8    have an internal number on it. It's
9    Exhibit 2 your deposition, sir.
10 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
11    Q.   Top right corner, do you see
12 those numbers?
13        I'd like to take you, sir, if
14 we could, to -15    A.   I don't see an Exhibit 2. Oh,
16 I'm sorry. This one.
17    Q.   This is a transcript of the
18 investigative hearing, right, before the
19 NTSB?
20        Do you see that first page?
21    A.   Yes.
22    Q.   June 22, 2023.

1 of our sites has to meet our approval."
2        Do you see that, sir?
3    A.   I do. I'm referring to the
4 work of our contractors.
5    Q.   That's right.
6        And when your contractors
7 recommend the course of activity with regard
8 to pressurized cars or vent and burn,
9 ultimately, Norfolk Southern has to approve.
10        Right?
11        MS. PETTY: Objection -12        MR. FUKUMURA: Objection.
13        MS. PETTY: -- to the form.
14        THE WITNESS: Norfolk Southern
15    has to approve the work of all of our
16    contractors. But in unified command,
17    that decision ultimately has to be
18    approved by that incident commander.
19 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
20    Q.   And what you said, sir, was,
21 "But ultimately, anything that's done on one
22 of our sites has to meet our approval."
23        That's what you told the NTSB.
24        Correct, sir?

|Page 79 1 Southern Railway derailment in East 2 Palestine. 3 Do you see that? 4 A. Yes. 5 Q. All right. Let's go to 190, 6 top right corner. Actually, 191, I believe. 7 And there's a question put to 8 you in an interaction with some panelists at 9 the NTSB hearing. 10 Do you see that? 11 A. Yes. 12 Q. And there's a quote from you. 13 Do you see that, Mr. Wood, in the middle of 14 the page? 15 A. 191? 16 Q. Yeah. I'm sorry, top of the 17 page, carrying over. Carries over.

The work of our contractors 8 must meet our approval. 9 Q. And the recommendation to vent 10 and burn had to meet your approval. 11 R ig h t ? 12 It's Norfolk -- 13 A. Any work by our contractors has 14 to meet the approval of Norfolk Southern. 15 Q. And before that had to be done 16 or before that was done, you approved it? 17 MS. PETTY: Objection. 18 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 19 THE WITNESS: Norfolk Southern 20 didn't approve the vent and burn. 21 Unified command at East Palestine and 22 the incident commander ultimately 23 approved the vent and burn. 24 QUESTIONS BY MR.

1 recommended it to incident command.
2        Wasn't that you that did that,
3 sir?
4    A.   I was one of the ones who did
5 that because I believed that was the safest
6 course of action.
7    Q.   Okay. Your contractors
8 recommended it, and then you recommended it
9 to incident command.
10        Right?
11        MS. PETTY: Objection.
12        THE WITNESS: Yes, it was
13    recommended to incident command.
14 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
15    Q.   You'd agree, sir, when incident
16 command is making a decision to do something
17 that Norfolk Southern itself has never done
18 before or that its contractor has never done
19 before, that you certainly shouldn't conceal
20 safety information about the risks of that
21 event.
22        Right?
23        MS. PETTY: Objection.
24        Wait. Wait. Wait for me to
25    finish my objection.


1    Same objections.
2        THE WITNESS: I'm sorry, you'll
3    have to repeat your question.
4 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
5    Q.   Yes, sir.
6        You said it was incident
7 command that made the decision.
8        My question to you, sir, was,
9 you'd agree that you shouldn't conceal safety
10 risks or information pertinent to the
11 decision from the people making the decision.
12        Right?

16        THE WITNESS: I agree, all
17    safety items should be brought to
18    the -- to the incident commander.
19 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
20    Q.   And when you bring in the
21 subject matter expert, and the subject matter
22 experts tell you something that's contrary to
23 the view expressed from somebody else, that's
24 certainly something you should be sharing
25 with the ultimate decision-makers.

PETTY: Same objections. 6 THE WITNESS: Ultimately, vinyl 7 chloride is a Chlorine Institute 8 mission chemical. We had two of the 9 three Chlorine -- CHLOREP contractors 10 on site. 11 Chip Day has been involved in 12 several vent and burns. And to my 13 knowledge, ESI, who we brought in, has 14 performed, I would say, every vent and 15 burn that's been conducted in the 16 United States. 17 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 18 Q. My question to you, sir, was, 19 you'd agree that you shouldn't conceal safety 20 information from incident command when 21 presenting a decision like that? 22 MS. PETTY: Objection. Vague. 23 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 24 Q. You'd agree? 25 MS. PETTY: Assumes facts.|Page 85 1 Right? 2 MS. PETTY: Objection. Calls 3 for a hypothetical. 4 THE WITNESS: Again, I can't 5 speak to any information that was 6 withheld from incident command on my 7 part. 8 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 9 Q. You weren't aware, sir, that 10 the subject matter experts had told Norfolk 11 Southern that the vinyl chloride and the cars 12 that were being discussed was not 13 polymerizing? 14 MS. PETTY: Objection. 15 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 16 Q. You were not aware of that, 17 sir? 18 MS. PETTY: Objection. 19 THE WITNESS: I was told by NS 20 HAZMAT personnel and contractors that 21 there were people from -- the shipper 22 of the product didn't believe the 23 product was polymerizing. 24 But that was the extent of it. 25 They didn't believe it.|

1 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
2    Q.   Folks didn't tell you, sir,
3 your team, your contractors, that when they

5 product, they had said, let me be clear, it's
6 not polymerizing?
7        MS. PETTY: Objection.
8 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
9    Q.   Nobody shared that with you,
10 sir?
11        MS. PETTY: Objection.
12        THE WITNESS: Information from
13    Oxy was shared that there were some -14    they believed it was not polymerizing.
15        We were dealing with a realtime
16    emergency, with observation from the
17    subject matter experts who respond to
18    these chemicals on a regular basis.
19        We consider all information.
20 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
21    Q.   I'm sorry, sir. My question
22 was, nobody shared with you that the subject
23 matter experts at Oxy Vinyls had said,
24 polymerization is not happening? No one
25 shared that with you?


1    one of -- two of three certified
2    CHLOREP contractors in the United
3    States.
4        There had been conversations

PETTY: Same objections. 7 THE WITNESS: Either -- one of 8 the NS HAZMAT managers or -- either 9 Chip Day or Drew McCarty, said folks 10 from Oxy had stated they believe the 11 product was polymerizing. 12 But that statement went against 13 every piece of written documentation 14 about the chemical out there. 15 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 16 Q. Who was the subject matter 17 expert on vinyl chloride monomer that Norfolk 18 Southern spoke with? 19 MS. PETTY: Objection. 20 THE WITNESS: Myself 21 personally?

7 conversations had taken place either between
8 the contractors and Oxy or our folks and Oxy.
9 When exactly those took place, I do not know.
10    Q.   You arrive on the scene, as I
11 understand it, sir, on the morning of
12 February 4th. That's a Saturday.
13        Is that right?
14    A.   Yes.

2        THE WITNESS: Yes, foam was
3    used -4 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
5    Q.   During the time you were there.
6    A.   Foam was eventually used to put
7 out spot fires.
8    Q.   Okay. On what days?
9    A.   I believe it would have started
10 on either Saturday afternoon or Sunday
11 morning, I believe.
12    Q.   Okay. Water was not being used
13 to cool the tanks.
14        R i g h t ?
15    A.   To cool which tanks?
16    Q.   Any of the areas that were in
17 the pool fire.
18    A.   There were no tanks being
19 cooled, mostly because the five tanks that we
20 were concerned about are jacketed tanks. So
21 spraying water on the jacket serves no
22 purpose. It's not actually contacting the
23 actual tank.
24    Q.   And so they're insulated from
25 heat?

PRDs had been going off over a 11 period of time since -- I don't know whether 12 they began before midnight on the 3rd or 13 whether into the morning of the 4th. 14 Q.

6 initial notifications.
7        After that, I'm -- I do not
8 know exactly who from NS on a given
9 conversation was part of it.
10    Q.   Did you know, sir, that Oxy
11 Vinyls had assembled a special situations

19        THE WITNESS: I don't know of
20    a n y o n e .
21 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
22    Q.   You did -- was it reported back
23 to you, sir, that if this vinyl chloride -24 we're talking about a constituent molecule.

Did you yourself say, I want to 6 talk to these folks? 7 MS. PETTY: Objection. 8 THE WITNESS: I did not. 9 My staff and our contractors 10 handled that communication. 11 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 12 Q. Okay. I mean, you spoke to 13 Chief Drabick about this issue, didn't you, 14 sir? 15 A. I did. 16 MS. PETTY: Objection. Vague. 17 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 18 Q. Before going to Chief Drabick, 19 you didn't attempt to go to the subject 20 matter expert yourself and understand really 21 what the state of the evidence was, the state 22 of the risks were, by speaking to them 23 yourself? 24 MS. PETTY: Objection. Lacks 25 foundation. Assumes facts.|Page 101 1 generate a lot of heat. 2 Was that shared with you? 3 A. That was shared, but that's a 4 common component of all monomers. 5 Q. Right. 6 And they said that if you were 7 worried about polymerization, you can find 8 out if it's polymerizing by looking to see if 9 the temperature is increasing. 10 Right? 11 MS. PETTY: Objection. Vague 12 as to "they." 13 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 14 Q. The Oxy Vinyls folks out of 15 Dallas, that's what they shared with your 16 team. 17 Did anybody share that with 18 you? 19 MS. PETTY: Objection. 20 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 21 Foundation. 22 Do you know what the question 23 is? 24 THE WITNESS: Did we know if -- 25 that if the product was polymerizing,|

1    it would get hot? Yes.
2 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
3    Q.   I mean, ultimately you started
4 to look at temperatures.
5        Right?
6        MS. PETTY: Objection.
7        MR. FUKUMURA: Objection.
8 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
9    Q.   Didn't Norfolk Southern,
10 through its contractors, start to monitor
11 their temperatures after speaking with Oxy
12 Vinyls about this temperature signature?
13        MR. FUKUMURA: Objection.
14        MS. PETTY: Objection.
15        THE WITNESS: Because the cars
16    had been involved in pool fires,
17    monitoring temperatures is part of
18    damage assessment. So, yes, we would
19    have monitored temperature of the cars
20    where available to us.
21 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
22    Q.   I want to be clear, sir. You
23 weren't monitoring all the cars that were in
24 pool fires for temperature.
25        Right?


1    Q.   So after this call on Saturday,
2 SPSI was already at vent and burn.
3        Weren't they?
4        MR. FUKUMURA: Objection.
5        MS. PETTY: Objection.
6        THE WITNESS:  The concerns
7    about the fear of runaway
8    polymerization with the cars were real
9    to us.
10        There were every indication,
11    there is a history with monomers, that
12    monomers will have a runaway -- when
13    they start polymerizing, they will run
14    away and there will be catastrophic
15    failures of a railcar if they're not
16    dealt with. It has happened before.
17 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
18    Q.   And the folks, Oxy Vinyls, said
19 the content of those cars is not
20 polymerizing. Nobody shared that with you.
21        C o r r e c t ?
22        MS. PETTY: Objection.
23        MR. FUKUMURA: Objection.
24        THE WITNESS:  The information
25    shared with me was that Oxy believed
|Page 103 1 MS. PETTY: Objection. 2 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 3 Q. You were just monitoring the 4 VCM cars. 5 Right? 6 MS. PETTY: Objection. 7 THE WITNESS: That's incorrect. 8 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 9 Q. The data you were tracking, 10 sir, the spreadsheet that you created, you 11 were tracking temperatures on the VCM cars. 12 Correct, sir? 13 MS. PETTY: Objection. 14 THE WITNESS: That is correct. 15 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 16 Q. We move into Sunday morning. 17 After you have your Saturday evening call 18 with the Oxy Vinyls folks, you had another 19 call. 20 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 21 MS. PETTY: Objection. 22 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 23 Q. Right? 24 A. I did not have any call with 25 Oxy Vinyls.|Page 105 1 the product was not polymerizing. 2 They never said this product would not 3 p o ly m e r iz e . 4 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 5 Q. Well, let's talk about that. 6 Who is Mr. Thomas, sir? 7 A. I believe he -- there's someone 8 named Thomas who was with Oxy. I believe. 9 Q. When you say so definitively, 10 sir, nobody said that, you're not aware 11 that's exactly what was said? 12 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 13 Asked and answered -- 14 MS. PETTY: Objection. 15 MR. FUKUMURA: -- 14 times. 16 THE WITNESS: No one said that 17 to me. 18 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 19 Q. Okay. So when the Oxy Vinyl 20 folks shared that with Norfolk Southern 21 representatives and its contractors, let me 22 be clear, "polymerization is not 23 occurring," you're saying nobody shared that 24 with you? 25 MS. PETTY: Objection.|

2    Foundation.
3        THE WITNESS: No. The word
4    shared with me was Oxy did not believe
5    it was polymerizing.
6 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
7    Q.   Okay. Nobody shared with you
8 that Oxy told SPSI and Norfolk Southern,
9 don't vent and burn because of
10 polymerization, because polymerization was
11 not occurring?
12        MS. PETTY: Objection.
13        MR. FUKUMURA: Objection.
14        MS. PETTY: Assumes facts.
15 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
16    Q.   No one shared that with you?
17    A.   No one shared anything other
18 than they believed the product was not
19 p o l y m e r i z i n g .
20    Q.   So the evening of the 4th and
21 the morning of the 5th, the Oxy folks are
22 sharing with your team, don't vent and burn
23 because of polymerization, because it's not
24 happening. And that information is not being
25 shared with you, sir.


1 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
2    Q.   The jury will have a full
3 record.
4        I just want to know factually,
5 sir, did anybody share that information with
6 you that I just related?
7        MR. FUKUMURA: Objection.
8        MS. PETTY: Objection.
9        MR. FUKUMURA: Asked and
10    answered now 17 times.
11        THE WITNESS: What was shared
12    with me was that Oxy believed the
13    product was not polymerizing.
14 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
15    Q.   When you were interviewed with
16 the NTSB, sir, in I believe it's Exhibit 1,
17 and -- you told the NTSB that some folks from
18 Oxy Vinyls said they didn't believe the
19 product would polymerize but others who
20 definitely said, yes, this stuff is going to
21 p o l y m e r i z e .
22        Do you recall telling the NTSB
23 that in your interview, sir?
24        MR. FUKUMURA: What page are
25    you referring to?

PETTY: And compound. 7 THE WITNESS: Again, the 8 information was shared that Oxy did 9 not believe the product was 10 p o ly m e r iz in g . 11 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 12 Q. Okay. Well, the jury will 13 decide what Oxy shared. It'll be a full 14 record for the jury. 15 MR. FUKUMURA: There's no 16 question. 17 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 18 Q. My question to you, sir, is, 19 nobody shared that with you. 20 Correct? 21 MR. FUKUMURA: Asked and 22 answered 16 times. 23 MS. PETTY: Objection. Assumes 24 facts. Asked and answered. 25|Page 109 1 MR. BUCHANAN: I'm sorry, it's 2 .12, sir. Exhibit 1. 3 MR. FUKUMURA: Take your time 4 and look at it. 5 THE WITNESS: I'm sorry. I'm 6 trying to see where -- 7 MR. BUCHANAN: I'm sorry. It's 8 .13, page 12. My apologies, sir. 9 MR. FUKUMURA: You can start at 10 12. 11 MR. BUCHANAN: Yeah, that's 12 fine. 13 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 14 Q. It reads here, sir, "We got 15 differing opinions from Occidental. Some 16 said this product, they didn't believe, would 17 polymerize, and others who definitely said, 18 yes, this stuff is going to polymerize." 19 Do you see that? 20 A. Yes. 21 Q. You told the NTSB that there 22 were Oxy Vinyl folks or Occidental folks who 23 said, who definitely said, yes, this stuff is 24 going to polymerize. 25 That's what you said, right?|

1        MS. PETTY: Objection.
2        THE WITNESS: That was the
3    information relayed to me, I believe,
4    from Drew McCarty.
5 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:

14 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
15    Q.   Do you know? Do you know from
16 that -- from what you heard from Mr. McCarty?
17    A.   I believe it was from one of
18 the representatives on site.
19    Q.   Oh. Who said it was definitely
20 going to polymerize?
21    A.   That's what I was told.
22    Q.   And you didn't share with the
23 NTSB in your interview that the Oxy Vinyls
24 folks who you spoke to on -- from the
25 situation room in Dallas said it's not going

4    Objection. Asked and answered.
5        THE WITNESS: That information
6    was never given to me, that Oxy said
7    this was definitely not polymerizing.
8 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
9    Q.   Pretty important information,
10 you'd agree?
11        MS. PETTY: Objection.
12        MR. FUKUMURA: Objection.
13        What?
14        THE WITNESS: All information
15    in an emergency is important.
16 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
17    Q.   It's certainly, sir, important
18 information that should be shared with
19 decision-makers making important decisions
20 about whether to conduct a vent and burn.

PETTY: Objection. 5 Same objection. 6 THE WITNESS: Again, the word 7 from -- that was given to me, the 8 people in Texas believed the product 9 wasn't polymerizing. And they were 10 saying that from Texas, not from East 11 Palestine. 12 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 13 Q. Right. 14 And they said, don't vent and 15 burn because of polymerization, because it's 16 not polymerizing. 17 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 18 MS. PETTY: Objection. 19 MR. FUKUMURA: Asked and 20 answered. 21 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 22 Q. We can agree you didn't share 23 that with the NTSB in the interview. 24 Correct? 25 MR. FUKUMURA: Share what?|Page 113 1 THE WITNESS: Again, all 2 information relative to an emergency 3 is important. 4 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 5 Q. Sure. 6 Certainly if the concern is a 7 runaway polymerization reaction and the 8 consequences thereof, it would be important 9 to share that the experts on the product have 10 said the product is not polymerizing. 11 You'd agree with that, right? 12 MS. PETTY: Objection. 13 THE WITNESS: That's 14 hypothetical. That's not what's -- 15 what was said. They believed it 16 wasn't polymerizing. 17 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 18 Q. Well, I'm sorry, sir, but, 19 respectfully, you didn't speak to Oxy Vinyl. 20 Right? 21 A. That is correct. 22 Q. And when this information was 23 relayed to you -- I think you've 24 characterized as you had different 25 viewpoints -- you never reached out to the|

10    experts we had on-scene had. Other NS
11    personnel had that are subject matter
12    experts as well.
13 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
14    Q.   So, sir, are you saying then if
15 the folks from Oxy Vinyls had said, this is
16 not polymerizing, don't conduct a vent and
17 burn, that was shared with your contractors,
18 that was not shared with you?
19        Is that what you're saying?
20        MS. PETTY: Objection.
21        MR. FUKUMURA: Objection.

Paul was assigned as a liaison 19 for site visits, and he would have instructed 20 them to go through SPSI because they were 21 handling emergency operations at the site to 22 tell them where it was safe to go and where 23 not safe to go. 24 Q. And you had Oxy Vinyl people on 25 the site Sunday afternoon.|Page 117 1 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 2 Q. Are you aware, sir, that 3 Mr. Williams directed that Oxy Vinyl reps 4 were not to communicate with NTSB, Norfolk 5 Southern, unified command?

7    conversations. I was not a part of
8    conversations with Oxy Vinyls.
9 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
10    Q.   Understood.
11        You've told us about what was
12 relayed or not relayed to you from those
13 conversations.

16        THE WITNESS: Yes.
17 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
18    Q.   There's obviously other
19 testimony from Oxy Vinyls representatives and
20 others about what was communicated or not
21 communicated in those meetings.
22        I take it you would defer to
23 the participants in those conversations.
24        Fair?
25    A.   I'm not sure what you're

2    A.   No. I walked into his fire
3 station and talked to him personally.
4    Q.   And put some time on that if
5 you could for us, sir. When was that in the
6 a f t e r n o o n ?
7    A.   Late afternoon? I want to say
8 somewhere around five o'clock.
9    Q.   And am I correct, sir, that you
10 provided Chief Drabick with about the same
11 update that you shared with the NTSB at six
12 o'clock that evening?
13        MS. PETTY: Objection.
14        THE WITNESS:  I provided him
15    the information of what we believed
16    that we had problems with the vinyl
17    chloride cars, that we had a
18    polymerization issue with a potential
19    railcar failure.
20 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
21    Q.   And it was essentially the same
22 update you provided to the NTSB at six
23 o'clock.

BUCHANAN: 25 Q. And you called Chief Drabick.|Page 121 1 MS. PETTY: Objection. 2 MR. FUKUMURA: Foundation. 3 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 4 Q. You don't recall previously 5 stating that, sir? 6 MS.

Do you have Exhibit 3 before you, 13 sir? 14 A. Yes. 15 Q. Okay. 16 MR. FUKUMURA: What page? 17 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 18 Q. We are going to .77. 19 This is the Hazardous Materials 20 Group Chair's Factual Report from the NTSB 21 h e a r in g . 22 Do you see that, sir? 23 A. Yes. 24 Q. And if we can go to the heading 25 at dot -- I'm sorry. The description at the|

1 top of .77 says, "At the NTSB progress
2 meeting on February 5, 2023, at 6 p.m."
3        Do you see that?
4    A.   Yes.
5    Q.   It says 18:00, but...
6        All right. "The Norfolk
7 Southern systems manager for hazardous
8 materials reported the following."
9        Do you see that?
10    A.   Yes.

16 that report to NTSB?

2        THE WITNESS: I knew there were
3    interactions, and I -- to clarify. By
4    the time the 5th -- the 4th and 5th
5    were there, we had 24-hour shifts
6    running, and I was running night
7    shift. So anything that happened
8    during the day, I physically was not
9    there. I was there from like 6 p.m.
10    till 6 a.m. the next morning.
11 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
12    Q.   Okay. I think you said you met
13 with Chief Drabick sometime Sunday afternoon.
14        R i g h t ?
15    A.   Right. It would have been
16 right about five o'clock before I took over
17 my shift.
18    Q.   Okay. So you're coming in.
19 You meet with Chief Drabick. You give him
20 essentially this update, and then there's a
21 unified command meeting.
22        R i g h t ?
23    A.   There was a meeting with city
24 officials. I'm not sure exactly who all was
25 there because I wasn't able to attend that

PETTY: Objection. 17 THE WITNESS: Again, I don't 18 know when all the -- exactly when all 19 those conversations took place. 20 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 21 Q. You're aware there were 22 significant interactions with those folks out 23 of Dallas. 24 R ig h t ? 25 MS. PETTY: Objection.|Page 125 1 entire meeting because I had to leave to go 2 to Youngstown, Ohio, to the NTSB meeting. 3 Q. Did you present essentially the 4 same information on .77 to both Chief Drabick 5 as well as unified command thereafter? 6 MS. PETTY: Objection. 7 THE WITNESS: I did not, 8 because I was not there. I was at the 9 NTSB meeting. So the contractors and 10 NS personnel that were there gave -- 11 really, the NS contractors, SPSI and 12 SRS, did most of the briefing, was my 13 u n d e r s t a n d in g . 14 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 15 Q. At unified command? 16 A. At the meeting at city hall. 17 Q. Okay. Well, let's look at what 18 you reported to Chief Drabick. 19 It says, "A Norfolk Southern 20 system manager for hazardous materials" -- 21 That's you, second to last 22 b u l le t . 23 Do you see that? 24 A. Yes. 25 Q. Okay.|

1        -- "stated the temperature in
2 one car, as measured with a thermal camera on
3 the tank shell, had risen to 138 degrees
4 F a h r e n h e i t . "
5        Do you see that?
6    A.   Yes.
7    Q.   "Whereas 185 degrees Fahrenheit
8 is the critical temperature for a runaway
9 polymerization reaction, according to Oxy
10 V i n y l s . "
11        Do you see that?
12    A.   I do.
13    Q.   Okay. Where did you get that
14 fact from, sir?
15    A.   The 185 critical temperature
16 would have come from either Chip Day or more
17 than likely Drew McCarty.
18    Q.   Okay. And you know that's not
19 true today.
20        Right?
21        MS. PETTY: Objection.
22        MR. FUKUMURA: What's not true?
23        THE WITNESS: Yes.
24 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
25    Q.   That at 185 degrees, you have a


1    A.   Yes.
2    Q.   Okay. And there had been no
3 polymerization, or at least Oxy Vinyls had
4 told you there had been no polymerization, as
5 of that point in time despite the PRDs going
6 off?
7        MS. PETTY: Objection.
8        MR. FUKUMURA: Objection.
9        MS. PETTY: Lacks foundation.
10    Compound.
11        THE WITNESS: Again, Oxy -- the
12    word passed to me was Oxy said they
13    believed the material was not
14    polymerizing.
15        The critical -- the critical
16    aspect of 185 is when the product
17    starts approaching higher
18    temperatures, the curve of the
19    reaction goes up sharply. So you get
20    faster increase in temperature, faster
21    increase of reaction, to critical.
22 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
23    Q.   Okay.
24    A.   But the 185 was more -- my
25 understanding is the pressures would be
|Page 127 1 runaway polymerization reaction. 2 You know that's not true? 3 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 4 MS. PETTY: Objection. 5 THE WITNESS: I do not know the 6 exact temperature at which a runaway 7 reaction takes place, but all the 8 information says at 185, the pressure 9 of the product in the tank makes the 10 PRDs open up -- 11 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 12 Q. Okay. 13 A. -- which makes the car unsafe 14 to be around. 15 Q. Well, I mean, the PRD -- 16 MR. FUKUMURA: Are you done 17 with your answer? 18 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 19 Q. Oh, I'm sorry. 20 Are you done with your answer? 21 A. Yes. 22 Q. I mean, the PRDs had been going 23 off at various points in time over those two 24 days. 25 Right?|Page 129 1 enough that if the PRDs start going off, you 2 can't be around the cars. 3 Q. You didn't have the 4 understanding, sir, that when the pressure 5 release devices went off, that whenever they 6 went off, that actually has a cooling effect? 7 You didn't have that knowledge, sir? 8 MS. PETTY: Objection. 9 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 10 THE WITNESS: The PRDs in the 11 fire, they operated as they're 12 designed to operate. 13 But we had one of the cars, 14 five and a half hours out of being out 15 of any fire, the PRD went off for like 16 70 minutes. That was one of the first 17 things that alarmed us. The car 18 hadn't been in a pool fire, I believe, 19 for over five and a half hours. 20 So any rise in temperature is a 21 concern to us. 22 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 23 Q. My question, sir, was just you 24 didn't have the knowledge, sir, that when the 25 PRDs go off, the contents of the car cooled?|

5    Q.   Did you know that or not know
6 that? That's just my question.
7        MS. PETTY: Same objections.
8        THE WITNESS: Anytime with a
9    liquified gas, when it releases a
10    vapor at high speed, you can have a
11    cooling effect to the product.
12 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
13    Q.   You said can, right?
14    A.   Yes.
15    Q.   Okay. That's what I thought.

4 you to get to Youngstown for these progress
5 meetings with the NTSB?
6        MS. PETTY: Objection.
7    Compound.
8        THE WITNESS: It usually takes
9    about 30 to 45 minutes. It depends on
10    traffic.
11 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
12    Q.   Okay. And is that how you're
13 timing about how long you got to spend at the
14 unified command meeting?
15    A.   It would have been somewhere
16 close to five, maybe ten minutes.
17    Q.   Okay. All right. And how did
18 that work, sir, these NTSB progress meetings?
19 Were you -- were you syncing up with folks
20 more broadly at Norfolk Southern before you
21 went in to talk to the NTSB?
22        MS. PETTY: Objection.
23        THE WITNESS: No. I was part
24    of the hazardous materials chair, so
25    everything I did strictly dealt with
|Page 131 1 currently 11:17 a.m. 2 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 3 Q. Thank you, Mr. Wood. I'd like 4 to circle back to where we were. I believe 5 this is exhibit -- we are at Exhibit 3. We 6 were on that page, top right corner, said 7 . 7 7 . 8 Again, this is your report to 9 the NTSB at a progress meeting at 6 p.m. on 10 that Sunday, February 5th. 11 Do you see that summary? 12 A. Yes. 13 Q. I think you told us, sir, that 14 you had met with Chief Drabick in the 15 firehouse not too far but before this time. 16 But roughly what is it, 4:30, five o'clock 17 that day? 18 A. It was somewhere around five 19 o'clock, yes. 20 Q. Okay. You participated in part 21 of the unified command meeting. Then you had 22 to leave to get to the NTSB progress meeting. 23 Correct? 24 A. I was there for the start of 25 the meeting.|Page 133 1 what the HAZMAT team at NTSB were 2 dealing with. 3 (Wood Exhibit 6 marked for 4 identification.) 5 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 6 Q. Okay.

3 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
4    Q.   Right.
5        I mean, you -- I guess Norfolk
6 Southern used Teams. You have these kind of,
7 what, videoconferences or teleconferences
8 through that service?
9    A.   Yes. Norfolk Southern uses
10 Teams.
11    Q.   Okay. You recall using it
12 during this period of time, sir, 4th, 5th,
13 6th, to sync up with broader Norfolk Southern
14 folks on various issues related to the
15 derailment?
16        MS. PETTY: Objection.
17        THE WITNESS: I'm sure I
18    participated in some briefings on the
19    incident. I'm sure I did.
20 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
21    Q.   And you're listed here as a

17    not. There were regular briefings, so
18    I don't know whether I was actually on
19    this one here or not. I don't know.
20 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
21    Q.   Well, before Norfolk Southern,
22 through you, recommended to Chief Drabick to
23 do a vent and burn, and you shared the
24 information that you shared and didn't share
25 the information you didn't share, did you
|Page 135 1 point in time when you had your conversation 2 in the firehouse with Chief Drabick. After, 3 I guess, you'd left the unified command 4 meeting on your way to the NTSB briefing. 5 Right? 6 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 7 MS. PETTY: Objection. 8 MR. FUKUMURA: Foundation. 9 THE WITNESS: The timing -- 10 that's the timing of this. 11 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 12 Q. Okay. And were there folks 13 besides yourself that were interacting with 14 you? 15 I mean who weren't kind of on 16 the ground there, interacting with you from 17 Norfolk Southern as to what to communicate or 18 not communicate with the NTSB? 19 MS. PETTY: Objection. 20 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 21 THE WITNESS: No. 22 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 23 Q.

19    A.   They were briefed of everything
20 on site.
21    Q.   Ms. Hart was out of the -- what
22 was her role?
23    A.   Ms. Hart was AVP of safety and
24 environmental.

Were you getting their input, 7 sir, on the decision to vent and burn or not? 8 MS. PETTY: Objection. Vague 9 as to "decision." 10 THE WITNESS: Any briefings 11 that went to my supervisors included 12 input that I was getting from 13 contractors and otherwise about the 14 incident. 15 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 16 Q. And did you get input back from 17 them? 18 A. I'm sure I did. Nothing 19 directly related to the vent and burn that I 20 recall. 21 Q. Who from Norfolk Southern, sir, 22 was involved in the decision to vent and burn 23 beyond yourself? Mr. Deutsch? 24 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 25 MS.

Mr. Schoendorfer is retired. 10 Q. Okay. Let's go back to 11 exhibit -- I believe we're at 3, in that 12 page 77. 13 We started to look at this 14 before the break, sir. We're on this bullet, 15 second up from the bottom. 16 This is in your 6 p.m. briefing 17 to the NTSB where you stated the following, 18 "The Norfolk Southern system manager for 19 hazardous materials stated the temperature in 20 one car, as measured with a thermal camera on 21 the tank shell, had risen to 138 degrees 22 Fahrenheit, whereas 185 is the critical 23 temperature for a runaway polymerization 24 reaction, according to Oxy Vinyls." 25 Do you see that, sir?|

12 you told Chief Drabick, as best you recall?
13    A.   Yes.
14    Q.   Continues. "The temperature in
15 one car had increased by 3 degrees in one
16 hour, suggesting that the VCM lading was
17 undergoing polymerization."
18        Do you see that, sir?
19    A.   Yes.

21 at 6 and what you told Chief Drabick an hour
22 b e f o r e .
23        R i g h t ?
24    A.   Yes. There was a 3-degree
25 increase in temperature outside the presence


1    Q.   And the NTSB?
2    A.   If that's stated in the report,
3 then, yes.
4    Q.   And as best you recall, that's
5 what your contractors told the unified
6 command at the meeting you had to leave
7 earlier from.

3 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
4    Q.   Too many documents here, sir.
5 Let me find one.
6        And you're monitoring
7 temperatures, sir, because the Oxy Vinyls
8 folks had said if you want to know whether
9 there's a polymerization reaction going on,
10 monitor the temperatures?

17        THE WITNESS: No, that's not
18    the reason why we were monitoring
19    temperatures.
20 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
21    Q.   Oh, I see.
22        You weren't aware, though, that
23 the Oxy Vinyls folks had told your team that?

25        THE WITNESS: The only


1 Temperature Measurements Readings April 13,
3        Have you seen this before, sir?
4    A.   I don't recall the handwritten
5 notes. The spreadsheet I'm familiar with.
6    Q.   Okay. Let's look at the
7 document at .2. It's an e-mail forwarding a

9        I realize you didn't draft the
10 e-mail, sir, but I just want to see how this
11 syncs up with your recollection.
12        In the middle it says, "Around
13 4 p.m. on February 5, Norfolk Southern's

No one from Oxy shared anything 11 directly with me. 12 Q. I see. 13 But your team didn't relate 14 that to you either. 15 Correct? 16 A. I don't recall any discussion 17 of it, but heat production during 18 polymerization is a known. 19 (Wood Exhibit 7 marked for 20 id e n t if ic a t io n . ) 21 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 22 Q. Okay. Here you are, sir. 23 We're up to Exhibit 7 in your deposition. 24 This is a Group D, Exhibit 9, 25 entitled "NS E-mail Explanation of Tank Car|Page 149 1 were relayed by phone or text by SPSI to 2 Robert Wood or Jon Simpson, who then entered 3 those readings onto a spreadsheet for 4 tracking purposes." 5 Do you see that, sir? 6 A. Yes. 7 Q. Does that refresh your 8 recollection, sir, as to whether or not you 9 were tracking the temperatures in the vinyl 10 chloride cars? 11 MS. PETTY: Objection. 12 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 13 THE WITNESS: There was no 14 question about I was tracking the 15 t e m p e r a t u r e s . 16 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 17 Q. And you specifically, sir, were 18 tracking the vinyl chloride temperatures on a 19 s p r e a d s h e e t . 20 Correct, sir? 21 MS. PETTY: Objection. 22 THE WITNESS: Yes. 23 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 24 Q. Okay. You were entering 25 those readings that you were getting relayed|

1 to you from SPSI into a spreadsheet.
2        C o r r e c t ?
3    A.   Yes.
4    Q.   I take it you would agree, sir,
5 it would be important to collect and monitor
6 and report on data accurately?
7        MS. PETTY:  Objection.
8        THE WITNESS:  Yes.
9 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
10    Q.   I mean, you had been told that
11 this polymerization reaction was a highly
12 exothermic reaction.
13        R i g h t ?
14    A.   I had not been given any -15 temperature rise during polymerization is a
16 k n o w n .
17    Q.   Okay. I mean, escalating
18 temperatures would be an indication that
19 there may be a concern that you needed to act
20 o n .
21        F a i r ?
22        MS. PETTY: Objection.
23        THE WITNESS:  Yes.
24 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
25    Q.   And that's one of the reasons


1 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
2    Q.   Okay. Passing you, sir, what
3 we're marking as Exhibit 8 to your
4 d e p o s i t i o n .
5        Have you seen this, sir?
6    A.   Yes.
7    Q.   You recall when you gave
8 testimony before the NTSB in June, you were
9 presented with a chart of your temperature
10 r e a d i n g s .
11        Right? On the vinyl chloride
12 c a r s ?
13    A.   Are you referring to this
14 c h a r t ?
15    Q.   I am, yes, sir.
16    A.   Yes, that's where I saw this
17 c h a r t .
18    Q.   Okay. Derived from data that
19 you'd actually recorded based on information
20 shared with you from your contractor.
21        Right?
22        MR. FUKUMURA: Objection.
23    Foundation.
24        THE WITNESS: I don't know
25    exactly where their data came from.
|Page 151 1 you were monitoring temperatures. 2 R ig h t ? 3 MS. PETTY: Objection. 4 THE WITNESS: Yes, because 5 railcars had been exposed to pool 6 f ir e s . 7 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 8 Q. Could I have P106? 9 MR. FUKUMURA: He's done with 10 it. 11 MR. BUCHANAN: You can set that 12 aside. 13 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 14 Q. I guess I should -- you recall 15 getting those temperature readings from your 16 contractors during the overnight and leading 17 up to the overnight? 18 A. Yes. 19 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 20 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 21 Q. And documenting those in a 22 s p r e a d s h e e t ? 23 A. Yes. 24 (Wood Exhibit 8 marked for 25 id e n t if ic a t io n . )|Page 153 1 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 2 Q. Okay. It's not your 3 understanding, sir, that it came from you? 4 Or from data that you had recorded? 5 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 6 THE WITNESS: I don't know that 7 it was data that I produced. 8 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 9 Q. Okay. 10 A. That was used to create this. 11 MS. PETTY: Counsel, I'm sorry, 12 we need to take a break for privilege 13 with respect to Document 7 to the 14 deposition, which doesn't appear to 15 have a regular Bates number on it. 16 It's my understanding that Ron 17 Wray is an attorney, and we need to 18 assess the privilege in this document. 19 I apologize. 20 MR. BUCHANAN: We can go off 21 the record. 22 VIDEOGRAPHER: We are now going 23 off the video record. The time is 24 currently 11:37 a.m. 25 (Off the record at 11:37 a.m.)|

1        VIDEOGRAPHER: We are now back
2    on the video record. The time is

4 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
5    Q.   All right. Sir, we're back on
6 Exhibit 8.
7        Do you have that before you?
8 That's that chart that you said you saw at
9 the NTSB hearing.
10        R i g h t ?
11    A.   Yes.
12    Q.   Okay. Presented to you by some
13 NTSB representatives.
14        F a i r ?
15    A.   It was part of the documents,
16 y e s .
17    Q.   Yeah.
18        It reflects a decision to vent
19 and burn right around that five, six o'clock
20 t i m e l i n e .
21        Do you see that? 4? 5? Do
22 you see that?
23        MS. PETTY: Objection.
24        THE WITNESS: I see that.

1 made as of Sunday afternoon to conduct a vent
2 and burn?
3    A.   There was a belief that Norfolk
4 Southern believed that that was the safest
5 means -6    Q.   Okay.
7    A.   -- but the ultimate decision is
8 the incident commander's.
9    Q.   Oh, I see.
10        So you're saying that you get
11 to bring some of the information but not all
12 of the information to Chief Drabick, and it's
13 on him if it was the wrong decision?
14        MS. PETTY: Objection.
15        MR. FUKUMURA: Objection.
16    Argumentative. Foundation.
17 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
18    Q.   Is that what you're saying?
19    A.   No.
20    Q.   Oh. Right.
21        Because he should have had all
22 the information that you had about whether it
23 was polymerizing or not polymerizing.
24        Right?
25        MS. PETTY: Objection.
|Page 155 1 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 2 Q. Do you see the temperatures 3 never go higher than, what is that, about 4 1 3 9 ? 5 A. Yes. 6 Q. And this is that car OCPX80370 7 that was one of the vinyl chloride cars. 8 Right? 9 A. Yes. 10 Q. And the overnight -- you were 11 working the overnight shift. 12 Is that right? 13 A. Yes. 14 Q. And as you were monitoring 15 temperatures on that car after the decision 16 had been made to vent and burn because of 17 escalating temperatures, temperatures 18 actually declined. 19 Right? 20 MS. PETTY: Objection. 21 THE WITNESS: There had been no 22 decision to vent and burn. 23 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 24 Q. I'm sorry, sir. 25 Hadn't there been a decision|Page 157 1 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 2 THE WITNESS: We brought him 3 all the information I believe we 4 thought we had. 5 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 6 Q. I mean, you had contractors in 7 the room who had been communicating with Oxy 8 Vinyl regularly who had said, let me be 9 clear, it's not polymerizing. 10 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 11 MS. PETTY: Objection. 12 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 13 Q. When you were sitting there, 14 sir, you didn't hear anybody from your 15 contractors share with Chief Drabick that the 16 expert on the chemical had said it's not 17 polymerizing. 18 Did you, sir? 19 MS. PETTY: Objection. 20 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 21 THE WITNESS: I was not there 22 for most of that meeting, so I don't 23 know what they told Chief Drabick. 24 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 25 Q. Well, you've looked at enough|
|---|---|


-----

1 at this point, sir, to know that none of the
2 contractors shared with Chief Drabick that
3 the experts from Oxy Vinyl had said, let me
4 be clear, it's not polymerizing; don't do a
5 vent and burn because you think it's
6 polymerizing?
7        MS. PETTY: Objection.
8        MR. FUKUMURA: Objection.
9        THE WITNESS: Again, the only
10    information that I have is that it was
11    passed on that Oxy believed the
12    product wasn't polymerizing.
13 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
14    Q.   I understand. You've testified
15 to that.
16        I just want to know, did you
17 observe your contractors share with Chief
18 Drabick what I just said, that the Oxy Vinyls
19 reps have said they said pretty clearly to
20 the contractors?
21        MS. PETTY: Objection.
22        MR. FUKUMURA: Objection.
23 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
24    Q.   And Norfolk Southern?
25        MS. PETTY: Objection.


1 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
2    Q.   Right.
3        Did you share with him at that
4 point on the 6th, after the temperatures had
5 dropped, that the Oxy Vinyls rep had told you
6 that without an exothermic reaction it's not
7 p o l y m e r i z i n g ?
8        MS. PETTY: Objection.
9        MR. FUKUMURA: Objection.
10        THE WITNESS: I did not.
11 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
12    Q.   And this was the car of concern
13 with the highest temperatures, right,
14 OCPX80370?
15        MS. PETTY: Objection.
16        THE WITNESS: That was the
17    first car of our immediate concern.
18 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
19    Q.   Right.
20        You blew up all the cars.
21        Right?
22        MS. PETTY: Objection.
23        MR. FUKUMURA: Objection.
24        THE WITNESS: No.
25
|Page 159 1 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 2 THE WITNESS: I did not witness 3 all the conversations. 4 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 5 Q. In the conversations you 6 witnessed, you did not hear that 7 communicated. 8 Correct? 9 A. I did not. 10 Q. Well, how about after this 11 decision had been recommended to Chief 12 D r a b ic k ? 13 And in this overnight period as 14 the temperatures are dropping, did you come 15 back and say, I think we should rethink 16 whether to do a vent and burn; the 17 temperatures have stabilized and they're 18 d r o p p in g ? 19 Did that communication happen 20 with Chief Drabick? 21 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 22 MS. PETTY: Objection. 23 THE WITNESS: Chief Drabick was 24 informed of all the temperatures. 25|Page 161 1 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 2 Q. All the vinyl chloride cars. 3 Right? 4 MS. PETTY: Objection. 5 THE WITNESS: We vented and 6 burned all five vinyl chloride cars. 7 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 8 Q. Okay. When you say "vented and 9 burned," you planted explosive devices in two 10 locations on each of them. 11 Correct? 12 MS. PETTY: Objection. 13 THE WITNESS: Our contractors 14 applied explosives. 15 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 16 Q. I'm sorry. With Norfolk 17 Southern's endorsement and recommendation. 18 Right? 19 You had to authorize that 20 action by your contractors. 21 Correct? 22 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 23 THE WITNESS: Ultimately the 24 incident commander authorized it, but 25 they were Norfolk Southern's|
|---|---|


-----

1    contractor.
2 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
3    Q.   And you authorized your
4 contractor to take that step.
5        Correct?
6        MS. PETTY: Objection.
7        THE WITNESS: The incident
8    commander authorized it.
9 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
10    Q.   I'm sorry, sir. I thought we
11 looked at your testimony earlier where you
12 said, Norfolk Southern's contractors on site
13 work under your direction and approval,
14 Norfolk Southern's.
15        R i g h t ?
16    A.   They do.
17    Q.   Their actions to plant
18 explosives on five cars and blow them up to
19 vent and burn these things came with your
20 endorsement and approval.
21        Correct?
22        MS. PETTY: Objection.
23        MR. FUKUMURA: Objection.
24        THE WITNESS: Norfolk Southern
25    agreed with the incident commander's


1        THE WITNESS: My only knowledge
2    was they believed it wasn't
3    polymerizing.
4 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
5    Q.   My question to you, sir, is
6 that a piece of relevant information?
7        MS. PETTY: Objection.
8        THE WITNESS: Yes.
9 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
10    Q.   Right.
11        If a person is going to decide
12 to undertake an act to blow up five cars and
13 the risks that that represents, it's
14 important that they get information that may
15 be contrary to the view of Norfolk Southern's
16 contractor.
17        Right?
18        MS. PETTY: Objection.
19        MR. FUKUMURA: Objection.
20        THE WITNESS: All information
21    is important.
22 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
23    Q.   That's right.
24        Pretty big decision to put at
25 the feet of somebody.
|Page 163 1 decision. 2 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 3 Q. Wouldn't you agree, sir, that 4 the incident commander should get the 5 relevant information to make an informed 6 decision before making it? 7 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 8 Asked and answered. 9 MS. PETTY: Objection. 10 THE WITNESS: Yes. 11 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 12 Q. Isn't that only fair? 13 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 14 MS. PETTY: Objection. 15 THE WITNESS: All relative 16 information is important. 17 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 18 Q. Right. Right. 19 So if the product experts, the 20 subject matter experts, on vinyl chloride 21 monomer have said it's not polymerizing, 22 you'd agree that's a piece of relevant 23 information. 24 Correct? 25 MS. PETTY: Objection.|Page 165 1 Right? 2 MS. PETTY: Objection. 3 THE WITNESS: The decision to 4 vent and burn is a huge decision. 5 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 6 Q. In fact, the folks from Oxy 7 Vinyls said, it's not that you blow up a 8 couple of holes in each of these tanks; you 9 ignite fires around the tanks as well. 10 Right? 11 MS. PETTY: Objection. 12 MS. BROZ: Objection. Form. 13 THE WITNESS: There are flares 14 and ignition sources applied to make 15 sure the product burns. 16 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 17 Q. Right. 18 Because if the product doesn't 19 burn, what the Oxy Vinyls folks had told you, 20 you could have a vapor cloud explosion. 21 Right? 22 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 23 Foundation. 24 MS. PETTY: Objection. 25|

1 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
2    Q.   Right, sir?
3    A.   Yes, you will have vinyl
4 chloride.
5    Q.   A vapor cloud explosion.
6        Right?
7    A.   There will be a large expanding
8 gas cloud if the material doesn't ignite.
9    Q.   And do you recall the folks
10 from Oxy Vinyls, those Dallas folks, sharing
11 with your team the concern that if you didn't
12 fully ignite the vinyl chloride after the
13 vent and burn, there could be a catastrophic
14 vapor cloud explosion?
15        MS. PETTY: Objection.
16        THE WITNESS: Yes.
17 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
18    Q.   Okay. Did you share that with
19 Chief Drabick?
20    A.   I did not.
21    Q.   Well, we have these
22 temperatures that you were monitoring
23 overnight before you -- what is this,
24 Exhibit 8? -- after it peaks at 1:39.
25 Doesn't look like an exothermic reaction to


1        MR. FUKUMURA: Objection.
2        THE WITNESS: Again, all we
3    were monitoring -- could monitor was
4    the temperature of the exterior of the
5    tank that was exposed to both product
6    inside and winter weather in Ohio
7    outside.
8 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
9    Q.   Well, maybe you could just
10 share with us, sir, the temperatures that
11 were shared with you from your contractor,
12 SPSI, were they at that critical temperature
13 for a runaway polymerization reaction?
14        MS. PETTY: Objection.
15        MR. FUKUMURA: Objection.
16        THE WITNESS:  The external
17    temperatures from the tank that we
18    were getting were not.
19 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
20    Q.   In fact, they were going in the
21 other direction.
22        R i g h t ?
23        MR. FUKUMURA: Objection.
24        MS. PETTY: Objection.
25
|Page 167 1 m e . 2 How about to you, sir? 3 MS. PETTY: Objection. 4 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 5 THE WITNESS: All we were able 6 to get was surface temperatures of the 7 outside of a tank of one tank. We 8 never were able to get actual product 9 t e m p e r a t u r e s . 10 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 11 Q. Okay. But when you went to the 12 NTSB that night at 6 p.m., you said the 13 increase in temperature by 3 degrees was an 14 indication that it was undergoing 15 p o ly m e r iz a t io n . 16 Isn't that what you told the 17 N T S B ? 18 MS. PETTY: Objection. 19 THE WITNESS: Yes. That's what 20 we believed. 21 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 22 Q. Okay. And the contrary is not 23 true, sir, when the temperature is declining, 24 that it's not undergoing polymerization? 25 MS. PETTY: Objection.|Page 169 1 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 2 Q. They were declining? 3 MS. PETTY: Objection. 4 THE WITNESS: Eventually, yes. 5 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 6 Q. They declined from midnight 7 through, what, the next day, up until the 8 vent and burn? 9 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 10 MS. PETTY: Objection. 11 THE WITNESS: Yes, with several 12 spikes in temperature in between. 13 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 14 Q. Never approaching 185 -- 15 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 16 MS. PETTY: Objection. 17 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 18 Q. -- the runaway polymerization 19 temperature you told the NTSB about. 20 R ig h t ? 21 MS. PETTY: Objection. 22 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 23 THE WITNESS: Again, the 24 external temperatures of the tank 25 never approached that.|

1 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
2    Q.   Okay.
3    A.   We don't know what the actual
4 temperature of the product in the core of the
5 tank was.
6    Q.   Well, those are the
7 temperatures you provided to the NTSB.
8        R i g h t ?
9        You said you had 138-degree
10 reading from the shell. Thought that was
11 information worth sharing.
12        F a i r ?
13        MS. PETTY: Objection.
14        THE WITNESS:  Yes.
15 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
16    Q.   You said 185 degrees for a
17 runaway temperature, the critical temperature
18 for a runaway polymerization reaction, that's
19 what you shared.
20        R i g h t ?
21    A.   Yes.
22        (Wood Exhibit 9 marked for
23    i d e n t i f i c a t i o n . )
24 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
25    Q.   Okay. Let's look at your


1    A.   Yes. But the only one of
2 primary concern was the OCPX.
3    Q.   Okay. And we see the readings
4 off to the right, that's OCPX80370.
5        R i g h t ?
6    A.   Correct.
7    Q.   The other readings on the other
8 cars are reflected to the left?
9    A.   That's correct.
10    Q.   Okay. And we can see,
11 certainly, as indicated by your actual
12 readings on this chart, the temperatures in
13 OCPX80370 declined throughout the period of
14 time you were monitoring them.
15        R i g h t ?
16        MS. PETTY: Objection.
17        MR. FUKUMURA: Objection.
18    Asked and answered.
19        THE WITNESS:  They eventually
20    declined, with several spikes in
21    b e t w e e n .
22 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
23    Q.   I see. Yeah.
24        You reported to the NTSB, what,
25 the 138 at 6 p.m.
|Page 171 1 spreadsheet. 2 We're looking at Exhibit 9 3 here, sir. 4 Do you recognize this? 5 A. Yes. 6 Q. And what is it, sir? 7 A. It appears to be a printout of 8 the temperature spreadsheet. 9 Q. A spreadsheet that you 10 documented the readings in? 11 A. Yes. 12 Q. I think you said that you were 13 only monitoring the temperatures on 14 OCPX80370. 15 Do you recall saying that a few 16 minutes ago? 17 MS. PETTY: Objection. 18 THE WITNESS: No. 19 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 20 Q. Oh. You may have said it, and 21 maybe you didn't intend to characterize it 22 that way. 23 You were monitoring 24 temperatures on all the vinyl chloride cars. 25 R ig h t ?|Page 173 1 R ig h t ? 2 A. Yes. 3 Q. And then we see it gets up to 4 139, I guess, and then it drops for all the 5 subsequent readings. 6 R ig h t ? 7 A. No. 8 Q. I'm sorry. 9 Where do we finish here at the 10 time of the vent and burn, sir? 11 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 12 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 13 Q. What was the temperature 14 reading as of the time of the vent and burn? 15 Or the last reading before the vent and burn. 16 A. The last reading is 126. 17 Q. All right. Thank you. You can 18 set that aside. 19 I just want to talk about this 20 vent and burn as implemented by Norfolk 21 Southern and its contractors. 22 Is there FRA guidance on how to 23 conduct a vent and burn? 24 A. There is an FRA document. It's 25 the basis for all vent and burn training, I|

1 think.
2    Q.   Okay. Were you aware of that
3 guidance before the vent and burn, sir?
4    A.   I had not actually viewed that
5 document, no.
6    Q.   As best you know, sir, SPSI and
7 its contractors did not use that handbook as

5 rupture and environmental contamination."
6        Do you see that?
7    A.   Yes.
8    Q.   "During derailment accidents,
9 tank cars may become structurally compromised
10 by denting, crack initiation or puncturing,
11 and/or subject to external heating and
12 associated increase in internal pressure.
13 The vent and burn procedure is applied to
14 damaged tank cars only when all other
15 emergency product removal methods have been
16 considered and rejected and the consequences
17 of not relieving the internal tank car
18 pressure are determined to be greater than
19 using this procedure."
20        Do you see that, sir?
21    A.   Yes.
22    Q.   Okay. As of, I guess, the
23 morning of the 6th, please share with us,

Do you have my question in 10 mind, though, sir? 11 Okay. My question was, sir, 12 please tell us what evidence you had that the 13 contents of the tank cars, the pressure in 14 those was rising despite the falling 15 temperatures. 16 MS. PETTY: Objection. 17 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 18 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 19 Q. That's my question. 20 A. Those concerns started when we 21 had a PRD go off five and a half hours after 22 that car had been in a pool fire, with no 23 presence of pool fire, when the car should 24 have been cooling. 25 Q. You didn't see in the NTSB|

6    Q.   You're not aware of that?
7    A.   I'm not -- I'm not sure how
8 you're -- what you're asking.
9    Q.   You're not aware, sir, that
10 PRDs will continue to go off even after an
11 incident fire where the heat source has been
12 controlled or remediated?
13        MS. PETTY: Objection.
14        THE WITNESS: Yes, PRDs will go
15    off as long as there's enough pressure
16    to open.
17 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
18    Q.   Right. They're insulated
19 tanks.
20        Right, sir?
21        MS. PETTY: Objection.
22        THE WITNESS: These tanks have
23    100-minute fire protection.
24 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
25    Q.   Are they insulated tanks?


1    A.   Yes.
2    Q.   In fact, the company and its
3 contractors had discussed with Oxy Vinyl, the
4 chemical's manufacturer, what that chemical
5 was doing inside of that tank.

3    didn't mean to misstate your
4    testimony.
5        THE WITNESS: Norfolk Southern
6    didn't have a written plan.
7 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
8    Q.   Are you aware of one?
9    A.   Unified command had a list of
10 documents. I'm not exactly sure what ESI,
11 who was the actual contractor who performed
12 the vent and burn, what their paper
13 documentations were.
14    Q.   Right.
15        "Prepare a written plan of
16 operation to ensure all parties involved have
17 a clear understanding of the impending
18 actions."
19        Do you see that?
20    A.   Yes.
21    Q.   All right. You were certainly
22 one of the parties involved.
23        Right?

5 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
6    Q.   Have you seen a written plan
7 from anybody?
8    A.   I believe there was one in
9 incident command.
10    Q.   Oh, okay.
11    A.   In unified command.
12    Q.   Okay. It says, "Conduct
13 briefings with all parties involved at each
14 stage of the process to ensure mutual
15 understanding."
16        Do you see that?
17    A.   It's on the same page?
18    Q.   Yeah. Second bullet.
19    A.   Yes.
20    Q.   It would be important to make
21 sure that the parties involved had a mutual
22 understanding of the basis, or the
23 probability of the basis, for the reason for
24 the vent and burn.
25        You would agree?


1        I think you told us fire
2 suppression activities had stopped.
3        Right?
4    A.   There were no fire suppression
5 activities going on when I arrived.
6    Q.   Who is Mr. Naranjo? Or
7 Naranjo?
8    A.   Bryan, at the time, was system
9 manager of environmental operations for
10 Norfolk Southern.
11    Q.   Work under you?
12    A.   No, he works in the same
13 department.
14    Q.   Okay. Who does he report to?
15    A.   At that time he reported to
16 David Schoendorfer.
17    Q.   I see.
18        So you both reported to
19 Mr. Schoendorfer?
20    A.   Yes.

Well, don't you think it's 8 important that people who are parties to this 9 process understand really what the 10 probability of the concern is that's giving 11 rise to the recommendation to vent and burn? 12 MS. PETTY: Objection. 13 THE WITNESS: All information 14 is important. 15 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 16 Q. Right. 17 That shouldn't be kept from 18 decisionmakers, right? 19 MS. PETTY: Objection. 20 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 21 THE WITNESS: No. 22 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 23 Q. I got some questions for you 24 generally, sir, about back in time, going 25 earlier when you got to the site.|Page 189 1 I see you're not on this, sir. 2 This looks like some kind of chat, whether 3 text or Teams, from February 4, 2023. 4 Do you see that? 5 A. Yes. 6 Q. Who is Mr. Hunsicker? 7 A. Chris Hunsicker is the regional 8 manager of environmental operations -- 9 Q. Okay. 10 A. -- based out of Pittsburgh. 11 Q. Did he report to or just was 12 he, you know, if you will, at a lateral level 13 to Mr. Naranjo? 14 A. He reported to Mr. Naranjo. 15 Q. Naranjo? 16 A. Yes. 17 Q. I'm sorry, I apologize. 18 All right. We see this text 19 chain. Is this around the time when you're 20 getting into East Palestine? Saturday 21 morning -- 22 A. No. 23 Q. -- 8 a.m.? 24 A. No. 25 Q. When are you rolling into East|

1 Palestine, sir?
2    A.   Been closer to around eleven
3 o'clock.
4    Q.   Oh, I see. Okay.
5        So in this exchange
6 Mr. Hunsicker is asking, what's the plan for
7 today, going back and forth with Mr. Naranjo.
8 And it says, "Bob just got there. We are
9 letting things continue to burn."
10        Do you see that there? Do you
11 see that?
12    A.   Yes.
13    Q.   Okay. I take it that's not you
14 referenced as the Bob there?
15    A.   No.
16    Q.   Okay. That statement, though,
17 is consistent with your observation that
18 Norfolk Southern was just continuing to let
19 things burn on Saturday morning.
20        Right?
21        MS. PETTY: Objection.
22        THE WITNESS: There were no
23    fire suppression activities going on.

4    Q.   -- to a Robert Scoble.
5        Do you see that?
6    A.   Yes.
7    Q.   It's also to Scott Deutsch and
8 others.
9        Have you seen this before, sir?
10    A.   I don't think so.
11    Q.   Okay. It says, "Good morning,
12 wanted to bring everyone on board with issues
13 discussed overnight regarding the release to
14 the waterways."
15        Do you see that?
16    A.   Yes.
17    Q.   "At the onset of the response,
18 Ohio EPA recommended to NS environmental
19 contractors, ECs, prepare for the expected
20 release to Sulfur Run and Leslie Run,
21 including installation of applicable
22 containment and mobilize high-volume pumps."
23        Do you see that?
24    A.   Yes.
25    Q.   Yet despite that recommendation
|Page 191 1 question is, that's consistent, that you were 2 just letting things continue to burn? 3 MS. PETTY: Objection. 4 THE WITNESS: Yes. 5 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 6 Q. Were you the individual who was 7 interacting with the Ohio EPA about all the 8 stuff that was getting dumped into the 9 creeks? 10 MS. PETTY: Objection. 11 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 12 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 13 Q. In the bed there? 14 A. I had some conversations with a 15 gentleman from Ohio EPA, but I think most of 16 his conversations were probably with Scott 17 Deutsch. 18 (Wood Exhibit 12 marked for 19 identification.) 20 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 21 Q. Passing you what we're marking 22 as Exhibit 12 to your deposition, sir. 23 Here you are. 24 Sir, this is an e-mail exchange 25 from Sunday, the 5th, in the morning at|Page 193 1 from the Ohio EPA, the material from the cars 2 that had been breached, otherwise released, 3 entered into the various creeks and water 4 sources around East Palestine. 5 Correct? 6 MS. PETTY: Objection. 7 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 8 THE WITNESS: Yes, materials 9 from the derailment entered Sulfur Run 10 and Leslie Run. 11 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 12 Q. Okay. It says, "At 11:30 on 13 the 4th" -- 14 That would be right around when 15 you were getting there? 16 A. Yes. 17 Q. -- "a release of material from 18 the derailment was observed by Ohio EPA in 19 Sulfur Run and beyond its confluence with 20 Leslie Run." 21 Do you know those various 22 streams or bodies of water, sir? 23 MS.

7    Q.   "And the release was
8 impacting" -- frankly, it was killing fish.
9        Right?
10    A.   Yes, there was a fish kill.

12    storm drains.
13 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
14    Q.   What material entered storm
15 drains, sir?
16    A.   Materials released from the
17 derailment.
18    Q.   Okay. Which of the materials,
19 as best you know, sir, were released into the
20 storm drains?
21    A.   Again, the same ones that got
22 to the creek.
23    Q.   This e-mail continues at
24 20:30 hours on the 4th. That's 10:30 at
25 night. "The containment measures in Sulfur

I do not know. 8 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 9 Q. Please tell us what, to your 10 best understanding, did enter the creek, sir. 11 A. To the best of my 12 understanding, I believe they found butyl 13 acrylate and lube oil and possibly some 14 glycol material. 15 Q. Not a good thing? 16 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 17 THE WITNESS: No release to a 18 waterway is a good thing. 19 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 20 Q. Beyond the waterways, it was 21 also released in, what? Into seepage pits in 22 the town? 23 Is that right? 24 MS. PETTY: Objection. 25|Page 197 1 Run were observed by Ohio EPA in a failing 2 condition, allowing the suspected butyl 3 acetate {sic} layer to continue to impact 4 Leslie Run and beyond." 5 Do you see that? 6 A. Yes. 7 Q. So the issue was identified by 8 the Ohio EPA to Norfolk Southern, and 9 notwithstanding Norfolk Southern being made 10 aware of it, remediation measures to prevent 11 it from continuing were ineffective. 12 MS. PETTY: Objection. 13 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 14 Q. Right? 15 A. According to Norfolk -- to Ohio 16 EPA, the containment boom was not holding 17 properly. 18 Q. It says it was in a failing 19 condition. 20 Right? 21 A. Yes, that's what it says. 22 Q. It states, "Throughout the day, 23 weather conditions prevented vacuum truck 24 recovery of accumulated material, but 25 alternative recovery methods were not|

1 utilized to alleviate the buildup at the
2 containment points, adding to the bypass of
3 the containment measures."
4        Do you see that?
5    A.   I do see that.
6    Q.   And is that consistent with
7 your memory of the situation, sir?
8        MS. PETTY: Objection.
9        THE WITNESS: I'm not sure what
10    alternative recovery methods the
11    gentleman is referring to. There were
12    vac trucks there.
13 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:
14    Q.   And you are aware, though, sir,
15 that whatever measures were undertaken, they
16 were being bypassed because these measures
17 were in a failing condition at that point in
18 time?
19        MS. PETTY: Objection.
20        MR. FUKUMURA: Objection.

10    Q.   As I understand it, sir, you
11 weren't there for the entire time that things
12 were burning.
13        Right? The cars and their
14 contents were burning. You had to leave?
15    A.   Yes.
16        MS. PETTY: Objection.
17        THE WITNESS: Yes.

So they would be in EPA records as 4 well as Norfolk Southern records. 5 Q. How would you get a copy of 6 those records, sir, reflecting how much load 7 was recovered from each of these cars? 8 A. I'm assuming I would just ask 9 somebody who is in charge of the data portal 10 for the site. 11 Q. Okay. And who would that 12 person be or a person be that would do that? 13 A. I think I -- anybody in our 14 department can probably -- in management in 15 our department, probably. 16 Q. All right. Thank you, sir. 17 I'm looking at the release of 18 polyethylene, sir. 19 Do you see that? First two 20 lines on -- 21 A. Yes. 22 Q. -- first page? 23 A. Yes. 24 Q. .2? 25 A. Yes.|

1    Q.   I guess it's P254.2.
2        It says, "Commodity,
3 polyethylene. Status after derailment" -4        What's it say?
5    A.   "Lading destroyed by fire."
6    Q.   So, too, with the second car?
7    A.   Yes.
8    Q.   Okay. And to the extent
9 there's indication on any of these items in
10 here that a load was only partially burned or
11 partially recovered, there's a way to
12 identify how much was recovered.
13        Right?
14        MS. PETTY: Objection.
15        THE WITNESS: With regards to
16    the polyvinyl and the polyethylene,
17    yes, because those are solid waste.
18    Anything that was collected as part of
19    excavations, no.

24    Q.   For each of these items, sir, I
25 take it you would endeavor to be as accurate

BUCHANAN: Oh, I'm sorry. 24 Let me correlate with the actual name, 25 guys. Apologies, sir.|Page 229 1 as you could in terms of capturing the amount 2 of spill or burned quantities? 3 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 4 MS. PETTY: Objection. 5 THE WITNESS: Yes. 6 (Wood Exhibit 15 marked for 7 identification.) 8 QUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN: 9 Q. Let's turn back to -- you can 10 set that aside, sir. 11 I want to talk about that 12 subpoena. Can I have P181? 13 Passing you, sir, what we're 14 marking as Exhibit 15 to your deposition, 15 it's a copy of a subpoena that was served on 16 you through counsel relating to request for 17 documents and ultimately your deposition. 18 Have you seen it before? 19 A. I probably have if it went to 20 NS. I would have never seen it if they sent 21 it to the address on this subpoena. 22 Q. Okay. I believe we sent it 23 through NS, but we'll check that. 24 Go to .7, Request for 25 Production.|

20 Southern has sued Oxy Vinyls?
21    A.   I am.
22    Q.   Okay. And I'm going to be
23 jumping around, and I apologize for that. It
24 happens when you go second in a deposition.
25 So I'll try to do my best to keep you
|Page 235 1 A. Yes. 2 Q. Forwarding a movie? 3 A. Yes. Apparently my company 4 phone was using a personal e-mail address. 5 It's the only thing I can figure. 6 MR. BUCHANAN: Okay. We'll 7 just call for production, sir, and ask 8 counsel to work with you to search 9 your devices to ensure that we've got 10 all the responsive information to our 11 subpoena. 12 MR. FUKUMURA: We've searched 13 his devices, so the question -- I 14 understand what the issue is. I'm 15 e-mailing about that right now. 16 MR. BUCHANAN: That's fine. 17 We're marking it, and we'll revisit if 18 we need to. 19 At this point, sir, I'm going 20 to -- I have more questions for you, 21 but we have limited time, so I'm going 22 to allow other counsel to conduct 23 their examinations now. 24 THE WITNESS: Okay. 25 MR.

1    Q.   It was -2    A.   Or if it was that phone. I'll
3 be honest with you, I'm not sure.
4    Q.   Okay. Between February 3,
5 2023, and today, you've replaced your iPhone?
6        MS. PETTY: Objection.
7        THE WITNESS: It's a company
8    iPhone. I think it's been replaced,
9    but I would have to double-check that
10    to see.
11 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:
12    Q.   Okay. And what would you need
13 to check to determine if you received a new
14 iPhone between February 3, 2023, and today?
15    A.   Check back with our tech folks.
16    Q.   And when you receive an iPhone
17 from the company, do you also use it for
18 personal messaging or personal e-mails?
19    A.   Probably. I don't carry a
20 personal phone.
21    Q.   And are you aware that on your
22 iPhone there's a text -- you can -- there are
23 text message settings that you can change or
24 alter?
25    A.   Not really.


1    Q.   Did you hand your iPhone over
2 to counsel for Norfolk Southern after
3 receiving that hold notice?
4    A.   Yes.
5    Q.   And do you recall approximately
6 when you did that?
7    A.   I don't -- I don't know the
8 exact date. I believe it was sometime in the
9 spring.
10    Q.   And at the time that you turned
11 over your iPhone to Norfolk Southern or its
12 counsel, did you check to see if the text
13 messages from the February 3rd through
14 February 6, 2023 time period were still on
15 your iPhone?
16    A.   I did not.
17    Q.   Did you look back at those text
18 messages at any time?
19    A.   I may have. I -- but I don't
20 know.
21    Q.   Okay. And when you received
22 that hold notice from Norfolk Southern or its
23 counsel, did you also suspend all deletion of
24 your personal e-mail address at the yahoo.com
25 e-mail address?
|Page 239 1 Q. Do you know if your text 2 message setting on your iPhone is set to 3 delete your text messages after 30 days? 4 A. I do not know. 5 Q.

Did you receive a hold -- a 10 document hold notice from either your counsel 11 or counsel for Norfolk Southern after the 12 vent and burn on February 6, 2023? 13 A. I received a document hold at 14 some time. I don't know exactly when, but, 15 yes. 16 Q. And did that document hold 17 notice tell you to suspend all deletion of 18 any messages that you would have either on 19 your iPhone or in your e-mails? 20 A. I believe so. 21 Q. And did you take any steps to 22 check your text message setting on your 23 iPhone to determine whether your text 24 messages were being deleted? 25 A. I did not.|Page 241 1 A. I don't know. 2 Q. Did you take any steps to 3 suspend deletion of messages that were on 4 your personal Yahoo! e-mail account? 5 A. I have done nothing with 6 settings on my personal e-mail account. 7 Q. Do you know how often e-mail 8 messages on your personal Yahoo! e-mail 9 account are deleted? 10 A. I do not. 11 Q. Okay. Let's turn to what was 12 previously marked as Deposition Exhibit 1, if 13 you have that in front of you. 14 A. Yes. 15 Q. Do you have that in front of 16 you? 17 A. Yes. 18 Q. You previously identified this 19 as your interview transcript in front of the 20 NTSB that was taken on February 8, 2023. 21 Correct? 22 A. Yes. 23 Q.

8    you.
9 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:
10    Q.   Do you have that in front of
11 you?
12    A.   I'm looking for what?
13    Q.   Page 23. The actual page
14 number of the document.
15    A.   Page 23?
16    Q.   Yes.
17    A.   Yes, I'm sorry. I had to peel
18 it back to see the page number.
19    Q.   Do you see where it says line
20 numbers on the left-hand side of the page?
21    A.   Yes.
22    Q.   Can you go to line 5, please?
23    A.   Yes.
24    Q.   And tell me if I read this
25 correctly. And it says, "And that car was


1        The car is standing upright.
2 The pipe at the base of the PRD is in the
3 vapor space. The car gets turned to its
4 side, it's in the liquid phase of the car.
5    Q.   So you are not saying in this
6 testimony that somehow the car was leaking
7 liquid from it?
8    A.   It would have been discharging
9 liquid out that PRD.
10    Q.   And what is your basis for your
11 understanding that it was discharging liquid
12 from out the PRD?
13    A.   The position of the PRD.
14    Q.   Anything else other than the
15 position of the PRD?
16    A.   No.
17    Q.   Did you see it discharging
18 liquid from the PRD?
19    A.   No. Just there was fire.
20    Q.   Did anybody report to you that
21 it was discharging liquid from the PRD?
22    A.   No.
23    Q.   So you assume that it was
24 discharging liquid from the PRD solely based
25 upon the orientation of the tank car?
|Page 243 1 also oriented a little different, too. So it 2 was in a liquid phase to begin with, which is 3 more than likely made the fire worse under -- 4 when it was just jetting, it was throwing 5 liquid out." 6 Do you see that testimony? 7 A. Yes. 8 Q. And which car were you 9 referring to when you were talking about the 10 car being in the liquid phase? 11 MR. FUKUMURA: You can look at 12 the preceding page as well. 13 THE WITNESS: Yeah, that's what 14 I'm looking at. 15 Yes, it would have been the car 16 of the greatest concern. 17 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 18 Q. So would that be OCPX80370? 19 A. Yes. 20 Q. And what is the basis for your 21 understanding that car OCPX80370 was, 22 quote/unquote, in the liquid phase? 23 A. The orientation of the car and 24 the position of the valves on the car, 25 specifically the PRD.|Page 245 1 A. Yes. The base of the PRD would 2 have been in the liquid. 3 Q. That wasn't my question. 4 Were you assuming that it was 5 discharging liquid because of the orientation 6 of the tank car? 7 A. Yes. 8 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 9 THE WITNESS: Yes. 10 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 11 Q. Let's go to line 11 on that 12 page. 13 VIDEOGRAPHER: We may need to 14 go off the record. 15 MS. BROZ: Okay.

1 line 21 of that page.
2    A.   Yes.
3    Q.   In answer to the question, "And
4 what does that do to the pressure relief
5 device?" you answered, "It will operate, but
6 it doesn't relieve pressure as fast because
7 it's pushing liquid."
8        Do you see that?
9    A.   Yes.
10    Q.   Was OCPX80370 in fact pushing
11 liquid?
12    A.   My belief is yes.
13    Q.   Based upon what?
14    A.   The position of the PRD.
15    Q.   Any other basis to conclude
16 that OCPX80370 was pushing liquid?
17    A.   No.
18    Q.   Do you have any video evidence
19 showing OCPX80370 pushing liquid out of the
20 PRD?
21    A.   Just the video of fire coming
22 from the PRD.
23    Q.   Fire and nothing else?
24    A.   That's it.
25    Q.   Do you have any pictures of it


1 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:
2    Q.   So it's your opinion that once
3 monomer exits from a PRD and reacts with
4 oxygen, it will automatically polymerize?
5        MS. PETTY: Objection.
6        THE WITNESS: It's my
7    understanding it can.
8 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:
9    Q.   Was the monomer that allegedly
10 was exiting from OCPX80370 polymerizing once
11 it met with oxygen outside the vinyl chloride
12 tank car?
13        MS. PETTY: Objection.
14        THE WITNESS: I do not know.
15 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:
16    Q.   Did you find any polymer -- let
17 me strike that.
18        Did you find any polymerized
19 vinyl chloride outside of OCPX80370 when you
20 had an opportunity to inspect the tank cars?
21    A.   I did not inspect the tank
22 cars.
23    Q.   How about when your responders
24 inspected the tank cars? Did they find any
25 polymerized vinyl chloride outside of
|Page 247 1 pushing liquid out of the pressure relief 2 device? 3 A. I see fire from the PRD. 4 Q. Just fire? 5 A. Yes. 6 Q. Nothing else? 7 A. Correct. 8 Q. You never saw liquid? 9 A. Fire. 10 Q. Just fire? 11 A. Yes. 12 Q. Okay. Let's go to line 24. 13 So you say, "So it's pushing 14 that monomer that wants to polymerize when it 15 gets some oxygen out through the ports." 16 Do you see that? 17 A. Yes. 18 Q. What is your basis that the 19 minute the stabilized vinyl chloride that was 20 in OCPX80370 went through the port that it 21 would automatically polymerize? 22 MS. PETTY: Objection. 23 THE WITNESS: The polymer 24 exiting the PRD. Or, excuse me, the 25 monomer exiting the PRD.|Page 249 1 OCPX80370? 2 A. No, just evidence of fire. 3 Q. Do you have any evidence -- or 4 let me strike that. 5 Based upon your knowledge, were 6 the PRDs activating properly in the five tank 7 cars containing vinyl chloride? 8 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 9 MS. PETTY: Objection. 10 THE WITNESS: The PR -- the 11 PRDs on the five vinyl chloride cars 12 did operate. 13 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 14 Q. You can set that aside. 15 MR. FUKUMURA: You can set that 16 exhibit aside. 17 (Wood Exhibit 18 marked for 18 identification.) 19 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 20 Q. We're going to mark a new 21 exhibit, Mr. Wood. 22 All right. Mr. Wood, I hand 23 you what we've marked as Deposition 24 Exhibit 18 and ask you if you recognize this. 25 A. Yes.|

1    Q.   What is it?
2    A.   It's an incident status report.
3    Q.   Is this also known as a form
5    A.   No.
6    Q.   It is not?
7    A.   No.
8    Q.   What is a form 201?
9    A.   Form 201 is a NIMS ICS briefing
10 form.
11    Q.   And were form 201s being
12 completed between February 3rd and
13 February 6th of 2023, following the tank
14 car -- the train derailment in East
15 Palestine?
16    A.   I believe unified command was.
17 That would have been one of their functions.
18    Q.   So these were internal -- these
19 incidence status reports were internal
20 Norfolk Southern forms?
21    A.   This is a Norfolk Southern
22 form, but it was shared outside of Norfolk
23 Southern.
24    Q.   And what was the purpose of
25 preparing and completing the incident status


1    A.   Yes.
2    Q.   It says, "Status report date is
4        Is that correct?
5    A.   Yes.
6    Q.   And it's from 7 p.m. on
7 February 4th through 7 a.m. on February 5th.
8        Is that correct?
9    A.   Yes.
10    Q.   And this would be operational
11 period 3?
12        MS. PETTY: Objection.
13        THE WITNESS: I'm not sure.
14 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:
15    Q.   Okay. Why don't you tell me
16 how you calculate operational periods.
17    A.   It varies by incidents.
18    Q.   All right. How about for this
19 incident?
20    A.   I believe these were being done
21 twice a day, I think, at shift change. I
22 think. Some incidents they're done just
23 every morning. It depends.
24    Q.   And when was shift change?
25    A.   Generally 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.
|Page 251 1 reports? 2 A. To provide an incident update 3 to NS personnel as well as any regulatory 4 agency that wanted it. 5 Q. And who prepared these incident 6 status reports for Norfolk Southern? 7 A. It would have been one of the 8 HAZMAT managers on -- 9 Q. Do you know who? 10 A. I was responsible for some of 11 them. Jon Simpson would have done some of 12 them. Probably most of them were done by Jon 13 Simpson, I think. 14 Q. Do you know which ones you 15 prepared as compared to which ones 16 Mr. Simpson prepared? 17 A. I do not recall. 18 Q. If you look at the top of -- 19 I'm going to go by Bates numbers -- NS-CA, 20 and the last three digits are 572. 21 Do you see at the bottom corner 22 there? 23 A. Uh-huh. 24 Q. Okay. Can you go to the top of 25 that page?|Page 253 1 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. 2 Q. Do you know why this one is 3 labeled 7 p.m. to 7 a.m.? 4 A. That's generally when 5 operational periods are, and you have an 6 overlap in personnel. 7 Q. So at the end of an operational 8 period, you'll complete an incident status 9 report? 10 A. Correct. Someone will. 11 Q. And you will do that every 12 12 hours? 13 A. On some incidents. 14 Q. How about this incident? 15 A. I believe so. At least for a 16 period of time. 17 Q. You believe that one was 18 created every 12 hours? 19 A. I believe. 20 Q. Do you know whether you 21 prepared what we've marked as Deposition 22 Exhibit 18? 23 A. I do not. 24 Q. Is there a way of telling who 25 prepared this form?|
|---|---|


-----

1    A.   I don't think so.
2    Q.   Where do you go -- let me start
3 that again.
4        Is there a computer system that
5 you go to to complete these forms at the end
6 of a shift change?
7    A.   This is just a Word document.
8    Q.   And where is the Word document
9 stored?
10    A.   Before or after?
11    Q.   After you're done completing
12 it.
13    A.   I think everything from East
14 Palestine went to the server file for the -15    Q.   What is the name of that file
16 you saved it on?
17    A.   The server file was set up in
18 our SharePoint system. I'll be honest, I
19 think it's just the derailment name.
20    Q.   Okay. Can you turn to what
21 we've marked as -- the last Bate -- three
22 digits of the Bates number are 574?
23    A.   Yes.
24    Q.   And do you see at the top there
25 it says "vinyl chloride" under the yellow


1        MR. FUKUMURA: Can you give us
2    the dot number, please?
3        MS. BROZ: .13.
4        THE WITNESS: Okay.
5 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:
6    Q.   Do you see the 3.1.1 paragraph?
7    A.   Yes.
8    Q.   In the third line down, it
9 repeats the language that the vinyl chloride
10 was sitting in situ.
11        Correct?
12    A.   Yes.
13    Q.   And then you see that last
14 sentence there?
15        It starts with "The release of
16 vinyl chloride resulted from the functioning
17 of pressure relief devices and from the
18 subsequent intentional vent and burn
19 actions."
20    A.   Yes.
21    Q.   Do you agree with the
22 statements in this paragraph?
23    A.   Yes.
24    Q.   And you agree with the
25 statements that were contained in your report
|Page 255 1 heading? 2 A. Yes. 3 Q. And it says, "The recovery 4 plan," and it says, "Currently in situ." 5 A. Yes. 6 Q. Do you know what that means? 7 A. That it's still in its -- where 8 it was originally at. 9 Q. And where was it originally at? 10 A. Inside the cars. 11 Q. And I want you to pick another 12 document for me, what we've marked previously 13 as Wood Deposition Exhibit 3. 14 Do you have that in front of 15 you? 16 A. Which one was it? 3, yes. 17 Q. Keep both of them in front of 18 you, but if you could grab Deposition 19 Exhibit 3. 20 A. Oh, yes. 21 MR. FUKUMURA: That's 2. 3 is 22 the big one. Oh, yeah, right. 23 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 24 Q. Okay. And if you could turn to 25 Bates number 336.|Page 257 1 that we previously marked as Deposition 2 Exhibit 18, that the vinyl chloride was in 3 situ? 4 A. Yes. 5 Q. Earlier today, I believe you 6 testified that vinyl chloride was being 7 released from the other valves of the vinyl 8 chloride cars? 9 A. Yes. 10 Q. And what is your basis for that 11 understanding? 12 A. Visible burning from around the 13 valves. 14 Q. So we're back to the fire 15 again? 16 A. Yes. 17 Q. Any other reason to conclude 18 that liquid vinyl chloride was leaking from 19 any of the valves contained on the tank cars? 20 A. It's reasonable to conclude 21 that that's vinyl chloride burning. 22 Q. I understand you're concluding 23 it's vinyl chloride, but what is your basis 24 to conclude that liquid vinyl chloride was 25 released -- was leaking from the valves in|

1 the tank cars?
2    A.   I said vinyl chloride was.
3    Q.   But not liquid?
4    A.   I don't know.
5    Q.   So you're changing your
6 testimony from earlier today where you
7 testified that liquid vinyl chloride was
8 leaking from the valves in the tank cars?
9        MS. PETTY: Objection.
10        MR. FUKUMURA: Objection.
11        THE WITNESS: No.
12        What was stated in the record
13    here and otherwise is we believed it
14    was liquid vinyl chloride burning out
15    of the PRD due to the position of it.
16        The possibility exists,
17    depending on where the fire is coming
18    from the valves, it could be liquid,
19    it could be vapors. We don't know.
20 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:
21    Q.   I think let's go a step back.
22        What is your basis for
23 understanding that vinyl chloride, liquid or
24 otherwise, was releasing from anything other
25 than the PRDs?


1 factual report which we've marked as
2 Exhibit 3?
3        MS. PETTY: Objection.
4        THE WITNESS: Yes.
5 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:
6    Q.   And that wasn't included in
7 there.
8        Correct?
9    A.   I don't recall whether it was
10 from me. I believe it was from somebody
11 else.
12    Q.   Where is that in this document?
13    A.   I don't know. I could go look.
14    Q.   We can go off the record and
15 you can look -- you can look all you want.
16    A.   Okay.
17        MS. BROZ: Okay. Let's go off
18    the record.
19        VIDEOGRAPHER: We are now going
20    off the video record. The time is
21    currently 2:08 p.m.
22     (Off the record at 2:08 p.m.)
23        VIDEOGRAPHER: We are now back
24    on the video record. The time is
25    currently 2:19 p.m.
|Page 259 1 A. The visible fires burning. 2 Q. Is it possible that the fires 3 were burning as a result of reacting with 4 some other chemical other than vinyl 5 chloride? 6 MS. PETTY: Objection. 7 THE WITNESS: No, I don't 8 believe so. 9 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 10 Q. Other than the fires, did you 11 see vinyl chloride leaking from anything else 12 other than the P -- let me take that back. 13 Let me start my question again. 14 Other than the fires, do you 15 have any other evidence that vinyl chloride 16 was leaking from any other of the valves on 17 the vinyl chloride tank cars? 18 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 19 THE WITNESS: No. 20 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 21 Q. And if you believe that, in 22 fact, vinyl chloride was leaking from the 23 valves on the vinyl chloride tank cars, you 24 would have the opportunity to include that 25 fact in the hazardous materials group chair|Page 261 1 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 2 Q. Mr. Wood, we went off the 3 record for about ten minutes to give you the 4 opportunity to review Wood Deposition 5 Exhibit 3. 6 Correct? 7 MR. FUKUMURA: For the record, 8 this is 159-page document. 9 MS. BROZ: The document speaks 10 for itself, Counsel. No speaking 11 objections. 12 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 13 Q. Did you have an opportunity to 14 review Wood Deposition Exhibit 3? 15 A. Yes. Part of it. 16 Q. And would you like to go off 17 the record again to continue to review Wood 18 Deposition 3? 19 A. No. 20 MS. PETTY: We're not going off 21 the record again. If you want to use 22 your time like this, that's fine, but 23 it will count to your time. 24 MS. BROZ: I note for the 25 record that the -- your opportunity to|

1    review the document was restricted by
2    your counsel and not by me.
3        MS. PETTY: Objection.
4 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:
5    Q.   And I believe that the reason
6 that we went off the record was for you to
7 find the citation in Wood Deposition
8 Exhibit 3 where it states that the valves
9 were leaking vinyl chloride in the five vinyl
10 chloride railcars.
11        Did you find that citation?
12    A.   The first instance of a -13 dealing with an angle valve is on .66.
14    Q.   And on .66, does it say
15 anything about that valve leaking vinyl
16 chloride after the derailment?
17    A.   It says, "The teardown of the
18 angle valve, the Midland manufacturing model
19 A720-0X-CVGFS, Serial Number GE-022-RA, found
20 the valve stem seal was heat-damaged and
21 missing and the gasket was heat-damaged."
22    Q.   And did you find anything in
23 what we've marked as Deposition Exhibit 3
24 stating that the valve, in fact, was leaking?
25    A.   Just that the valve gasket was


1 "BLEVE model by 08:00 on conference call
2 sourced by Norfolk Southern."
3        Do you see that?
4    A.   I do see that.
5    Q.   Do you know why "requested" is
6 in quotes?
7    A.   I do not.
8    Q.   And was Occidental's request
9 for a BLEVE model relayed to you?
10    A.   It may have been. I don't
11 recall.
12    Q.   Did you in fact receive a BLEVE
13 model?
14    A.   I did not.
15    Q.   You did not.
16        (Wood Exhibit 19 marked for
17    identification.)
18 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:
19    Q.   19?
20        So we're going to mark the next
21 exhibit as Deposition Exhibit 19, which is an
22 e-mail with an attachment, and we're going to
23 put those together to make one exhibit.
24        MR. FUKUMURA: Can you give us
25    two copies unless we're going to have
|Page 263 1 no longer there. 2 Q. And that's it? 3 A. Yes. 4 Q. Okay. You can set that aside. 5 Let's go back to what we've 6 marked as Deposition Exhibit 18, please. 7 A. Yes. 8 Q. Do you have that in front of 9 you? 10 A. Yes. 11 Q. Let's go to Bates number 574. 12 A. Yes. 13 Q. Are you there? 14 And at the bottom of that page, 15 there is a box. 16 Do you see the box? 17 A. Yes. 18 Q. And above that it says that 19 over -- it says, "Overall site strategy and 20 objectives." 21 Correct? 22 A. Yes. 23 Q. And below that in the box it 24 says, the last bullet point, "Occidental, 25 quote/unquote, requested, end quote" -- is it|Page 265 1 18 on the share screen? 2 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 3 Q. Mr. Wood, I've handed you what 4 we've marked as Deposition Exhibit 19. 5 Do you recognize this? 6 A. I do. 7 Q. And what is it? 8 A. It's an e-mail chain. 9 Q. And you now know from your 10 deposition to read e-mail chains from the 11 bottom up. 12 Correct? 13 A. Yes. 14 Q. Let's go to the last e-mail in 15 that e-mail chain, which is on Bates 16 number 229. 17 A. Yes. 18 Q. Do you see that? 19 A. Yes. 20 Q. And that's Paul Williams 21 sending this e-mail to you. 22 Correct? 23 A. No. 24 Q. That's you sending this e-mail 25 to Paul Williams?|

1        MR. FUKUMURA: Are we looking
2    at the same document?
3        THE WITNESS: Yes.
4        MR. FUKUMURA: Oh, I see.
5    Sorry.
6 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:
7    Q.   And that e-mail was forwarded
8 to you by a John T. Wilson of CTEH.com.
9        Correct?
10    A.   Yes.
11    Q.   And below that there's an
12 e-mail from Scott Skelton, who also was at
13 CTH.com, to an Ethan Currie at CTH.com.
14        Do you see that?
15    A.   Yes.
16    Q.   And is it -- who is CTEH?
17    A.   They're one of our air
18 monitoring contractors.
19    Q.   And is it -- do you call them
20 CTH, or do you call them something else?
21    A.   Generally CTEH.
22    Q.   And the subject line of that
23 e-mail is, "Use this version VC BLEVE model
24 updated."
25        Do you see that?


1    Q.   And why was this document sent
2 to you?
3        MS. PETTY: Objection.
4        THE WITNESS: I would assume it
5    was requested by someone.
6 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:
7    Q.   Was it requested by you?
8    A.   No, not to my knowledge.
9    Q.   Did you review it once you
10 received it in your e-mail on February 5,
11 2023, at 7:41 a.m.?
12    A.   I do not recall reviewing this
13 document.
14    Q.   Have you seen this document
15 before today?
16    A.   I do not recall seeing this
17 document.
18    Q.   Do you recall that a BLEVE
19 model was prepared between February 3rd and
20 February 6, 2023?
21    A.   According to this e-mail,
22 apparently so.
23    Q.   Did you ever discuss with
24 anybody the preparation of a BLEVE model?
25    A.   I did not.
|Page 267 1 A. I do. 2 Q. And it says that there is an 3 attachment called catastrophic failure 4 theoretical outcomes. 5 Correct? 6 A. It does. 7 Q. And there's a PowerPoint 8 attached to this? 9 A. According to the e-mail, yes. 10 Q. Okay. So let's go to the 11 attachment, which starts at NS-CA-000030231. 12 Do you see that? 13 A. Starts with what? 14 Q. NS-CA-0000 -- 15 A. Yes. 16 Q. -- 30231. 17 Correct? 18 A. Yes. 19 Q. And can you tell me what this 20 is? 21 A. VCR railcar catastrophic 22 failure. 23 Q. Is this a BLEVE model? 24 A. It appears to be a theoretic 25 outcome of a BLEVE.|Page 269 1 Q. Were you concerned about the 2 possibility of a BLEVE happening? 3 A. Yes. 4 Q. And what did -- who did you 5 relay that concern to? 6 A. The incident commander, 7 initially. 8 Q. And did you ask anyone to 9 prepare a model? 10 A. I did not. 11 Q. You did not? 12 A. I did not. 13 Q. Why would John T. Wilson be 14 sending you a copy of a BLEVE model on 15 February 5th if you didn't ask for it? 16 MS. PETTY: Objection. 17 THE WITNESS: More than likely 18 due to me being on site at the time. 19 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 20 Q. Any other reason? 21 A. I'm a representative from NS. 22 Q. You see that you're the only 23 one copied on the e-mail from John T. Wilson? 24 A. I do see that. 25 Q. And you never reviewed this?|
|---|---|

1    A.   I don't recall ever reviewing
2 this.
3    Q.   Do you understand that this
4 model assumes that the BLEVE will occur and
5 calculates its impact?
6        MS. PETTY: Objection.
7        THE WITNESS: It states it's a
8    theoretical outcome.
9 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:
10    Q.   If a BLEVE were to occur?
11    A.   Yes.
12    Q.   Did you ever ask anybody to
13 prepare a model to determine whether, in
14 fact, a BLEVE would occur?
15    A.   I did not.
16    Q.   Do you know if anyone on your
17 team did?
18    A.   Not to my knowledge.
19    Q.   Were you concerned about the
20 possibility of a BLEVE in the five vinyl
21 chloride tank cars?
22    A.   We were concerned about a
23 catastrophic failure.
24    Q.   And what would -- what would
25 cause a catastrophic failure in the five


1 overpressurization in any of the five vinyl
2 chloride tank cars?
3        MR. FUKUMURA: Objection.
4        MS. PETTY: Objection.
5        THE WITNESS: If the PRDs
6    ceased to operate properly due to
7    being clogged.
8 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:
9    Q.   And do you have any evidence
10 that the PRDs were clogged?
11    A.   I do not.
12    Q.   Okay. Have you seen any
13 evidence that the five PRDs were clogged?
14    A.   No actual evidence, no.
15    Q.   Let's go back -- I know I'm
16 jumping around, and I apologize -- back to
17 what we previously marked as Deposition
18 Exhibit 18.
19    A.   Okay.
20    Q.   Let's go to the Bates
21 number 574.
22    A.   Okay.
23    Q.   And then we'll go back to that
24 box again at the bottom of page where it says
25 that Occidental requested the BLEVE model.
|Page 271 1 vinyl chloride tank cars? 2 A. Internal overpressurization. 3 Q. And what would cause the 4 internal overpressurization? 5 A. We believe the cars were 6 p o ly m e r iz in g . 7 Q. Is there anything else, other 8 than the possibility of the five vinyl 9 chloride cars polymerizing, that would cause 10 internal overpressurization? 11 A. The product being in pool fires 12 would cause it to overpressurize. Failure of 13 the car can be due to pressurization combined 14 with damage to the tank in the derailment. 15 So there are multiple factors that go into 16 it . 17 Q. The pool fires would cause the 18 tank car to heat up. 19 C o r r e c t ? 20 A. Yes. 21 Q. When the tank car is heated up, 22 the PRDs would activate? 23 A. Yes. 24 Q. If the PRDs were activating, 25 was there any other risk of|Page 273 1 Do you know whether a BLEVE 2 model was ever provided to Occidental? 3 A. I do not. 4 Q. Can you turn the page, please? 5 We're at Bates number 575. 6 Correct? 7 A. Yes. 8 Q. And it says in the middle of 9 that page, "Site activities planned for the 10 next operating period." 11 Do you see that? 12 A. Yes. 13 Q. And the next operating period 14 would be 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. on February 5th. 15 Is that right? 16 A. I'm sorry? 17 Q. Is the next operating period 18 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. on February 5th? 19 A. It should be, yes. 20 Q. In the middle of that box it 21 says, "Meeting on site with SME from 22 Occidental to review potential tactics." 23 Do you see that? 24 A. Yes. 25 Q. And SME is subject matter|

2    A.   Yes.
3    Q.   And you yourself never met with
4 anyone from Oxy -- Occidental or Oxy Vinyls.
5        Correct?
6        MS. PETTY: Objection.
7        THE WITNESS: To my knowledge,
8    yes, I did not.
9 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:
10    Q.   And I don't miss -- earlier
11 today you had testified that information -12 let me start that question again.
13        Earlier today you had testified
14 that someone had told you Oxy Vinyls' opinion
15 with respect to polymerization in the five
16 vinyl chloride tank cars.
17        Correct?
18        MS. PETTY: Objection.
19        THE WITNESS: Yes.
20 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:
21    Q.   Did anyone from Norfolk

2 number ending 1936.
3        Are you still there?
4    A.   Yes.
5    Q.   And you testified, I believe,
6 and please correct me if I'm wrong, that you
7 called the demo experts at 5 p.m. on
8 February 5th to ask them to come to East
9 P a l e s t i n e ?
10    A.   I did not contact them. Chip
11 Day with SRS actually contacted them.

13 with him?
14    A.   No.
15    Q.   Did you tell him to contact
16 t h e m ?
17    A.   I did.
18    Q.   And why did you tell him to
19 contact them?
20    A.   Because we believed
21 polymerization was going on in the vinyl
22 chloride tank cars and that we were going to
23 need to perform a vent and burn.
24    Q.   And did you have Chip Day
25 contact the demo experts before or after you

3 recorded at any time prior?
4    A.   Yes.
5    Q.   Is there a temperature reading

|Page 299 1 discussing sampling protocols, timing or 2 logistics of taking residue samples from the 3 five vinyl chloride tank cars? 4 A. We would have had to have 5 discussions when the pressure plates were 6 going to be taken off and the cars would be 7 made accessible. 8 Q. And now to answer my question, 9 did you discuss any sampling protocols, 10 timing and logistics -- 11 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 12 Foundation. 13 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 14 Q. -- for taking residue samples 15 from the five vinyl chloride tank cars? 16 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 17 Foundation. 18 MS. PETTY: Objection. 19 THE WITNESS: I would have had 20 to have been involved in the timing. 21 The actual protocols, I don't think 22 s o . 23 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 24 Q. So you don't have any opinions 25 on whether the protocols were proper?|Page 301 1 identification.) 2 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 3 Q. All right. So I lied. I have 4 one more exhibit. 5 Mr. Wood, I've handed you what 6 we've marked as Deposition Exhibit 24 and ask 7 you if you recognize this. 8 A. It is a Norfolk Southern 9 incident status report. 10 Q. And what is the date of the 11 report? 12 A. 2/6/2023. 13 Q. And for what operational 14 periods? 15 A. It says 6 and 7. 16 Q. And what would that cover? 17 A. It should -- that 24-hour 18 period. 19 Q. Turn your attention -- 20 A. It should be from -- 21 Q. Go ahead. 22 A. Should be from 7 a.m. that 23 morning till the next morning. 24 Q. So 7 a.m. on February 6th to 25 7 a.m. on February 7th?|
|---|---|

1    A.   Should be, yes.
2    Q.   Turn your attention to the
3 Bates number 324.
4    A.   Okay. Yes.
5    Q.   And you see that second large
6 box at the bottom of the page?
7    A.   Yes.
8    Q.   And the seventh bullet down?
9    A.   Yes.
10    Q.   Do you see where it says,
11 "Post-demo, it was noted that Tank Cars
12 OCPX80179 and OCPX80370 showed visual
13 confirmation of active polymerization noted
14 by extended vapor release, two minutes of
15 vapor space hole, versus the other three cars
16 and distinct solid product released entrained
17 in the plume"?
18        Do you see that?
19    A.   I do.
20    Q.   Can you explain to me what that
21 means?
22    A.   That was the description
23 provided by the observers who set the blasts
24 off.
25    Q.   By the demo experts?


1    A.   That was their explanation when
2 they blew the holes in the cars.
3    Q.   And was SRS and SPSI part of
4 the blowing the holes in the cars?
5    A.   They assisted.
6    Q.   How did they assist?
7    A.   Mainly accessing the sites.
8 SRS and SPSI, their folks were the most
9 familiar with the cars. I don't know
10 specifically that they assisted setting any
11 explosives, but they were there to assist ESI
12 if they needed it.
13    Q.   So ESI set the explosives?
14    A.   Yes.
15    Q.   And this information that
16 post-demo it was noted that tank cars
17 OCPX80179 and OCPX80370 showed visual
18 confirmation of active polymerization, where
19 did that statement come from?
20    A.   One of those -- the
21 employees -- and I -- to be honest with you,
22 I don't remember which company they worked
23 for. Their description of it, they were at a
24 viewing area where they set the charges off.
25    Q.   Where was this viewing area?
|Page 303 1 A. Yes. 2 Q. ESI? 3 A. And SPSI was there with them. 4 And SRS was there with them as well to assist 5 them. 6 Q. So let me backtrack again. 7 This description was provided 8 by ESI? 9 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 10 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 11 Q. I'm asking a question. 12 A. I'm not sure which employee 13 specifically, but there were three 14 contractors at the site where the demolitions 15 were set off: SRS, SPSI and ESI. 16 Q. When were they on site? 17 A. Right up through when the vent 18 and burn took place. 19 Q. This is saying post-demo, 20 though, correct? This bullet point? 21 Read the bullet point. 22 A. Yes. 23 Q. Okay. And are they saying 24 post-demo it was noted that the tank cars 25 showed visual confirmation?|Page 305 1 A. They could see all five cars. 2 It was somewhere down off Taggart Road, I 3 think. 4 Q. While they were being vented 5 and burned? 6 A. Yes. 7 Q. And from -- how far away were 8 they from the vent and burn? 9 A. I do not know. You would have 10 to ask them. 11 Q. And who am I asking? 12 A. Drew McCarty with SPSI, Chip 13 Day with SRS, and Mr. Poe with ESI. 14 Q. And that was who was reported 15 that showed visual confirmation of active 16 polymerization? 17 A. Some representative from one of 18 those companies. 19 Q. All right. And this other 20 information about the extended vapor release 21 also came from them? 22 A. Yes. 23 Q. And the other three cars and 24 distinct solid product release entrained in 25 the plume also came from them?|

-----

1    A.   Yes.
2    Q.   Who put together this
3 particular incident status report that we've
4 marked as Deposition Exhibit 24?
5    A.   I do not know who put the
6 document together.
7    Q.   Is there any way to tell from
8 your records who put the document together?
9    A.   There may be, but I don't know.
10 I'm not sure how.
11    Q.   Did you ever see at the demo
12 site any visual confirmation -- let me strike
13 that question again.
14        Did you ever see at the demo
15 site any evidence of active polymerization
16 from the five vinyl chloride tank cars?
17    A.   I did not witness any.
18        MS. BROZ: That's all the
19    questions I have, Mr. Wood.
20        THE WITNESS: Okay.
21        VIDEOGRAPHER: Want to go off
22    the record?
23        MR. ELLIS: Sure, just to
24    switch spots.
25        VIDEOGRAPHER: We are now going


1    Q.   Okay. Was that about the time
2 you got a new phone?
3        MS. PETTY: Objection.
4        THE WITNESS: I don't remember
5    when I got the iPhone I have now. I
6    honestly don't remember.
7 QUESTIONS BY MR. ELLIS:
8    Q.   Okay. Was it sometime in 2023?
9    A.   Whether it was before the
10 incident or after the incident.
11        I've gotten a new computer
12 since then, I know. I just don't remember
13 when I got the newest iPhone.
14    Q.   You have your iPhone with you
15 here today.
16        Right?
17    A.   Yes.
18    Q.   Okay. Do you still have texts
19 on the iPhone that you have with you here
20 today that are from the period after the
21 derailment in February, say, February 3rd to
22 February 6th? Are those still on your phone
23 right now?
24    A.   I assume they are.
25    Q.   Okay. Did you check during any
|Page 307 1 off the video record. The time is 2 currently 3:14 p.m. 3 (Off the record at 3:14 p.m.) 4 VIDEOGRAPHER: We are now back 5 on the video record. The time is 6 currently 3:16 p.m. 7 DIRECT EXAMINATION 8 QUESTIONS BY MR. ELLIS: 9 Q. Mr. Wood, my name is Robert 10 Ellis. I represent GATX and General American 11 Marks. I'm going to ask you a series of 12 questions. 13 When I refer to GATX, can we 14 have the understanding that I'm referring 15 both to GATX and General American Marks? 16 A. Yes. 17 Q. Okay. Great. 18 I know you've answered some 19 questions about your cell phone. I just have 20 a few more follow-ups to it. 21 So it sounds like sometime in 22 the spring you gave your work iPhone to some 23 folks to collect materials off of it. 24 Correct? 25 A. That's correct.|Page 309 1 of the breaks? 2 A. No. 3 Q. Immediately after the 4 derailment, did you have any conversations 5 with anybody at GATX? 6 A. I don't recall any 7 conversations with GATX. 8 Q. Did you reach out to anybody at 9 GATX for any information at any time between 10 February 3rd and February 8th of 2023? 11 A. I did not. 12 Q. Are you aware of anybody at 13 Norfolk Southern reaching out to somebody 14 from GATX? 15 A. I am not aware of anyone. 16 Q. Okay. Did you ever think to 17 reach out to somebody at GATX in that period 18 of time immediately after the derailment? 19 A. I did not. 20 Q. And I take it then you didn't 21 instruct anybody from the Norfolk Southern 22 team to reach out to somebody from GATX for 23 information relating to any of the GATX cars 24 that were involved in the derailment? 25 A. I did not.|
|---|---|


-----

1    Q.   Okay. Did you -- are you aware
2 that GATX had one of the VCM cars involved in
3 the derailment?
4    A.   At the time of the derailment,
5 all we knew were the shippers, and that's who
6 we make initial con -- contact with, the
7 shippers of record of the car. History shows
8 that cars are leased, and some are privately
9 owned, some are leased.
10        So, no, that is not normally
11 one of the calls we would make.
12    Q.   Okay. My question was a little
13 different.
14        Were you aware that GATX95098
15 was one of the VCM cars involved in the
16 derailment?
17    A.   Yes. I knew the car number
18 was, yes.
19    Q.   Okay. And you knew that GATX
20 is a car designation for GATX the company.
21        Right?
22    A.   Yes.
23    Q.   Okay. That was something you
24 were familiar with.
25        Correct?


1 relief valve.
2        C o r r e c t ?
3    A.   Correct.
4    Q.   Did you see any of the
5 specifications for the PRD that was on 95098
6 in the time period immediately after the
7 derailment, say, February 3rd to February 6,
9    A.   I did not.
10    Q.   Did you ask for any
11 specifications relating to that PRD?
12    A.   No. The only thing we knew
13 were the settings of the PRDs because they're
14 posted in the car information.
15    Q.   The car information that was
16 part of the consist?
17    A.   No, the -- no. What you find
18 in UMLER.
19    Q.   Okay. So you went to UMLER to
20 look at the PRD settings for the various
21 c a r s ?
22    A.   That would be a common thing to
23 do. I don't know that I personally did it,
24 but I know someone did.
25    Q.   Okay. And my question was, did
|Page 311 1 A. Yes. 2 Q. Okay. And you knew that GATX, 3 I think as you just said, leases railcars. 4 R ig h t ? 5 A. Yes. 6 Q. Okay. Did you receive any 7 drawings related to GATX95098 in that time 8 immediately after the derailment between 9 February 3rd and February 6th? 10 A. I don't recall any. 11 Q. Did you ask for any drawings 12 from GATX95098 in that period between 13 February 3rd and February 6, 2023? 14 A. I did not. 15 Q. Are you aware of anybody at 16 Norfolk Southern looking at or requesting 17 drawings for GATX95098? 18 A. I'm not aware of any. 19 Q. Okay. What about for the -- 20 we've heard the abbreviation PRD referred to 21 from time to time today. 22 That's the pressure relief 23 device, correct? 24 A. That's correct. 25 Q. In other words, a pressure|Page 313 1 you do it? 2 A. I don't think so. 3 Q. Okay. Other than looking at 4 UMLER, did you get any other specifications 5 related to the PRD on 95098? 6 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 7 THE WITNESS: No. 8 QUESTIONS BY MR. ELLIS: 9 Q. What about after the vent and 10 burn? Did you ever have any contact with 11 anybody from GATX as to how to address the 12 derailment or subsequent cleanup after the 13 vent and burn? 14 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 15 MS. PETTY: Objection. 16 THE WITNESS: No. 17 QUESTIONS BY MR. ELLIS: 18 Q. Did you think to ask anybody at 19 GATX for any information after the 20 d e r a i lm e n t ? 21 A. No. 22 Q. I take it then that you didn't 23 instruct anybody to ask GATX for any 24 information after the derailment? 25 A. To my knowledge, no.|

-----

1    Q.   Okay. And I take it as you sit
2 here today, you've never had any
3 conversations with anybody at GATX about this
4 d e r a i l m e n t .
5        Is that correct?
6    A.   That, I -- that, I can't state
7 for sure because there were tank car owners
8 as part of NTSB stuff. So the possibility
9 exists I may have spoke with them.
10    Q.   Okay. Leaving out the NTSB
11 stuff, as you've characterized it, any
12 conversations with anybody at GATX about the
13 d e r a i l m e n t ?
14    A.   No.
15    Q.   And I think you testified
16 earlier today, this is the first derailment
17 that you had involving VCM cars that need to
18 be vented and burned.
19        C o r r e c t ?
20    A.   Yes.
21    Q.   And this is, in fact, the first
22 derailment you were involved with with any
23 vent and burn.
24        C o r r e c t ?
25    A.   Yes.


1        C o r r e c t ?
2        MS. PETTY: Objection.
3        THE WITNESS:  Yes.
4 QUESTIONS BY MR. ELLIS:
5    Q.   What was the last derailment
6 that you were involved with before the East
7 Palestine?
8    A.   Directly on site?
9    Q.   Sure. We're going to start
10 with that, and then since you characterized
11 it that way, I'm going to ask you indirectly.
12    A.   Directly on site, the main one
13 that comes to mind would have been in Bartow,
14 Georgia.
15    Q.   Okay. When was that?
16    A.   February -- I'm sorry, January
17 of 2019.
18    Q.   Okay. What about indirectly?
19    A.   And I'm sure I was on the sites
20 of others, but that's one of the ones that
21 comes to mind.
22        Indirectly, if it involves NS
23 HAZMAT personnel, I know about it.
24    Q.   Okay. So what was the one
25 immediately preceding East Palestine that
|Page 315 1 Q. Norfolk Southern transports VCM 2 quite frequently. 3 C o r r e c t ? 4 MS. PETTY: Objection. 5 THE WITNESS: Yes. I'm not 6 exactly sure the volumes, but -- 7 QUESTIONS BY MR. ELLIS: 8 Q. It's a part of Norfolk 9 Southern's day-to-day operations to transport 10 cars that have VCM. 11 C o r r e c t ? 12 A. Yes. 13 Q. Okay. And a derailment 14 involving cars with VCM is something that is 15 foreseeable to Norfolk Southern. 16 C o r r e c t ? 17 MS. PETTY: Objection. 18 THE WITNESS: We have 19 derailments, yes. 20 QUESTIONS BY MR. ELLIS: 21 Q. Yes. 22 And the possibility that one of 23 those derailments would involve a car with 24 VCM is something that Norfolk Southern could 25 f o r e s e e .|Page 317 1 involved Norfolk Southern HAZMAT personnel? 2 A. Oh, I would have to go check 3 the records. I honestly don't remember. 4 Q. Before the East Palestine 5 derailment, were you familiar with the 6 concept of polymerization? 7 A. Yes. 8 Q. You do not consider yourself an 9 expert in polymerization. 10 Am I correct about that? 11 A. No. 12 Q. Am I correct about that? 13 A. You're correct. 14 Q. Thank you. That was little 15 ships passing in the night. 16 What's the closest you got to 17 9 5 0 9 8 ? 18 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 19 THE WITNESS: The closest I got 20 to -- 21 QUESTIONS BY MR. ELLIS: 22 Q. To that tank car, to 95098. 23 A. I would say 100 feet. 24 Q. Did you yourself ever examine 25 the PRD on 95098 at any time after the|

-----

1 d e r a i l m e n t ?
2    A.   I did not.
3    Q.   How about the -- any portion of
5        I assume that since the closest
6 you got is 100 feet, you didn't examine any
7 part of GATX95098 after the derailment.
8        Is that correct?
9        MS. PETTY: Objection.
10        THE WITNESS: So let me
11    clarify.
12        During emergency operations, I
13    was never within 100 feet of the car.
14        After the vent and burn and
15    after NTSB come out, I viewed all of
16    the cars.
17 QUESTIONS BY MR. ELLIS:
18    Q.   Okay. And the first time you
19 got within 100 feet of GATX95098 to see and
20 examine that car was after the vent and burn.
21        Correct?
22        MS. PETTY: Objection.
23        THE WITNESS: For me to
24    personally get that close, correct.
25    There was a video feed from a


1 cars. Most all the cars I saw had fires from
2 all the valves on them that you could observe
3 from video feed.
4    Q.   Okay. So was your -- so let me
5 ask -- let me ask you this question.
6        As you sit here today, have you
7 reached a conclusion that VCM was released
8 from GATX95098 via a valve other than the
9 PRD?
10        MR. FUKUMURA: Objection.
11        MS. PETTY: Objection.
12        THE WITNESS: I can't say
13    specific without actually looking at
14    the records on the car. I don't know.
15 QUESTIONS BY MR. ELLIS:
16    Q.   As you sit here today, do you
17 know whether or not VCM was released from a
18 valve other than the PRD with respect to
19 G A T X 9 5 0 9 8 ?
20    A.   I cannot say that.
21    Q.   Would you take a look -- oh, I
22 had a question.
23        I think we saw in some of your
24 testimony to NTSB the discussion of a
25 decision tree.
|Page 319 1 sheriff's department camera that was 2 piped into the command post that we 3 were able to view. 4 QUESTIONS BY MR. ELLIS: 5 Q. Okay. My question was, the 6 first time you yourself ever personally 7 examined GATX95098 was after the vent and 8 burn was executed. 9 C o r r e c t ? 10 A. That's correct. 11 MS. PETTY: Objection. 12 QUESTIONS BY MR. ELLIS: 13 Q. Before then, the closest you 14 got was within 100 feet. 15 C o r r e c t ? 16 A. Myself, yes, correct. 17 Q. You were asked some questions, 18 and you gave some testimony about VCM that 19 was released from the cars via a valve other 20 than the PRD. 21 Do you remember that testimony? 22 A. Yes. 23 Q. Did you reach that conclusion 24 with respect to GATX95098? 25 A. I don't have specifics to which|Page 321 1 Do you remember that -- 2 A. Yes. 3 Q. -- testimony? 4 A. Yes. 5 Q. Okay. And that decision tree 6 was a decision tree that you undertake when 7 there's a derailment. 8 Is that correct? 9 MS. PETTY: Objection. 10 THE WITNESS: Yes, specific to 11 tank cars. 12 QUESTIONS BY MR. ELLIS: 13 Q. Okay. So anytime a tank car 14 derails, Norfolk Southern has a decision tree 15 that it undertakes in order to determine what 16 its response should be. 17 Correct? 18 MS. PETTY: Objection. 19 THE WITNESS: Yes. 20 QUESTIONS BY MR. ELLIS: 21 Q. Is that in writing? 22 A. No, it's in training material 23 for all railroad response. It's common 24 knowledge. 25 Q. My question was, is your|

1 decision tree in writing?
2    A.   No.
3    Q.   When you were reaching
4 conclusions -- let me ask you this.
5        Did you make a determination at
6 some time after February 3rd and before the
7 vent and burn that the PRD on GATX95098 had
8 stopped functioning?
9        MR. FUKUMURA: Objection.
10        THE WITNESS:  Not a definitive
11    determination, but that's what we
12    b e l i e v e d .
13 QUESTIONS BY MR. ELLIS:
14    Q.   Okay. My question was, did you
15 make a determination that the PRD on 95098
16 had stopped functioning?
17        MS. PETTY: Objection.
18        THE WITNESS: I had not.
19 QUESTIONS BY MR. ELLIS:
20    Q.   Have you ever reached that
21 c o n c l u s i o n ?
22    A.   I have not.
23    Q.   Would you mind getting out Wood
24 Exhibit 8?
25    A.   8?


1 about -- if you look at the X axis of this,
2 about 17:00?
3        Do you see that?
4        MS. PETTY: Objection.
5        THE WITNESS: I do.
6 QUESTIONS BY MR. ELLIS:
7    Q.   Okay. And 17:00, 5 p.m.,
8 that's -- decision to vent and burn, and it
9 shows the temperature of 80370 to be
10 somewhere between 103 and 140 degrees.
11        Correct?
12        MS. PETTY: Objection.
13        THE WITNESS: That's what the
14    graph shows, yes.
15 QUESTIONS BY MR. ELLIS:
16    Q.   And that's, in your experience,
17 what the temperatures were reading at that
18 time.
19        Correct?
20        MR. FUKUMURA: Objection.
21        MS. PETTY: Objection.
22        THE WITNESS: The surface
23    temperature of this tank car, that's
24    what readings we were getting at that
25    time.
|Page 323 1 Q. It's somewhere in the stack, 2 and it's this little -- 3 A. Yeah. 4 Q. But that's the back of it. So 5 if you're looking for the front, it looks 6 like that. But it's really that. The part I 7 want to talk to you about is the chart. 8 A. Here it is. Yes, I have it. 9 Q. Okay. If you take a look on 10 the other side, it's got the chart. 11 A. Yes. 12 Q. And this chart relates to one 13 of the Oxy VCM cars, 80370. 14 Correct? 15 A. Correct. 16 Q. Okay. Did you ever do a chart 17 like this for 95098? 18 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 19 QUESTIONS BY MR. ELLIS: 20 Q. GATX95098? 21 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 22 THE WITNESS: I did not. 23 QUESTIONS BY MR. ELLIS: 24 Q. Okay. And do you see here the 25 arrow decision to vent and burn that was|Page 325 1 QUESTIONS BY MR. ELLIS: 2 Q. Okay. And GATX95098, it never 3 got anywhere close to that. 4 Correct? 5 MS. PETTY: Objection. 6 THE WITNESS: I don't know. 7 QUESTIONS BY MR. ELLIS: 8 Q. Okay. From the temperature 9 readings you saw, GATX95098 never got 10 anywhere close to what is recorded here on 11 this graph. 12 Right? 13 MS. PETTY: Objection. 14 THE WITNESS: The temperatures 15 we got for the car never got above 165 16 off the bolster because we didn't have 17 access to the tank. 18 QUESTIONS BY MR. ELLIS: 19 Q. Oh. And GATX95098, you never 20 got a temperature off the tank that was 21 anywhere near 135 degrees. 22 Correct? 23 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 24 MS. PETTY: Objection. 25 THE WITNESS: We never got a|

1    temperature off the tank.
2 QUESTIONS BY MR. ELLIS:
3    Q.   All right. Am I correct that
4 you never got a temperature from the tank of
5 95098 that was anywhere near 135 degrees?
6    A.   We did not.
7        MS. PETTY: Objection.
8        MR. FUKUMURA: Objection.
9 QUESTIONS BY MR. ELLIS:
10    Q.   And in fact, the highest
11 temperature for 95098 that you got was about
12 67 degrees.
13        C o r r e c t ?
14        MR. FUKUMURA: Objection.
15        THE WITNESS:  If that's what
16    the chart shows, yes, 67 degrees was
17    the temperature we got off the
18    b o l s t e r .
19 QUESTIONS BY MR. ELLIS:
20    Q.   And when you say "got off the
21 bolster," what do you mean?
22        Explain for the folks that are
23 going to be watching this what you mean by
24 "getting off the bolster."
25    A.   The tank car is welded onto


1    A.   I did not.
2    Q.   Who told you that it was an IR
3 gun that was being used to take the
4 temperature on the various -- on the five VCM
5 tank cars?
6    A.   I believe it was Drew McCarty
7 with SPSI.
8    Q.   Okay. Was Drew McCarty the one
9 operating the gun?
10    A.   I don't believe so, but I don't
11 know that.
12    Q.   Was there a uniform procedure
13 used by the operator of the IR gun to take
14 the temperature of the various -- of the five
15 VCM tank cars that were involved in the
16 d e r a i l m e n t ?
17        MR. FUKUMURA: Objection.
18        MS. PETTY: Objection.
19        THE WITNESS: I don't know
20    their exact procedure. Was just every
21    hour to return to the car and the one
22    section of the tank that was exposed,
23    get a temperature reading from the
24    surface of the tank.
25
|Page 327 1 pads that are then welded to the bolsters, 2 which are the frames that sits on the trucks 3 that carry the wheels. 4 It's the only accessible piece 5 that had some kind of direct contact or 6 indirect contact to the tank. 7 Q. On GATX95098? 8 A. On all of the vinyl chloride 9 cars with the exception of 80370. 10 Q. Okay. So, and let me ask you 11 about that temperature reading and taking 12 those temperatures. 13 Somebody was using an IR 14 temperature gun to measure the temperatures 15 on the five VCM cars. 16 C o r r e c t ? 17 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 18 MS. PETTY: Objection. 19 THE WITNESS: That's my 20 u n d e r s t a n d in g . 21 QUESTIONS BY MR. ELLIS: 22 Q. Okay. Did you ever operate 23 that IR gun? 24 A. I did not. 25 Q. Okay. Did you see it?|Page 329 1 QUESTIONS BY MR. ELLIS: 2 Q. Do you know whether the person 3 operating the IR gun kept a record of where 4 he or she was pointing the gun? 5 A. That, I do not know. 6 Q. Did you ever ask for a record 7 of that? 8 A. I did not. 9 Q. Why not? 10 A. There was only one area where 11 the tank was exposed. It was not a large 12 section of the tank, so I didn't think it was 13 r e le v a n t . 14 Q. So you didn't want to have a 15 record of where the temperature was being 16 taken on each of these five VCM cars before a 17 decision was made to vent and burn? 18 MS. PETTY: Objection. 19 THE WITNESS: No. We were 20 taking temperatures from the only 21 place accessible. 22 QUESTIONS BY MR. ELLIS: 23 Q. Now, going back to Exhibit 8, 24 we were looking at OCPX80370. And at 24:00, 25 there was a spike to just under about|
|---|---|

1 138 degrees Fahrenheit.
2        C o r r e c t ?
3        MS. PETTY: Objection.
4        THE WITNESS:  According to the
5    graph, yes.
6 QUESTIONS BY MR. ELLIS:
7    Q.   And that's consistent with your
8 understanding of what was happening on scene
9 at the time.
10        R i g h t ?
11        MS. PETTY: Objection.
12        MR. FUKUMURA: Objection.
13        THE WITNESS:  Yes.
14 QUESTIONS BY MR. ELLIS:
15    Q.   Okay. And then it -16 temperature of this particular car declined
17 over time.
18        Right?  After that?
19        MR. FUKUMURA: Objection.
20        MS. PETTY: Objection.
21        THE WITNESS: Yes, I believe it
22    had a -- one or two more spikes before
23    t h e n .
24 QUESTIONS BY MR. ELLIS:
25    Q.   Okay. Now, GATX95098 never had


1 your spreadsheet.
2        R i g h t ?
3    A.   That is correct.
4    Q.   You viewed those as important
5 information to have about those cars, didn't
6 y o u ?
7    A.   Yes.
8    Q.   And those were temperatures
9 that you reported on to people including your
10 superiors at Norfolk Southern.
11        C o r r e c t ?
12    A.   That's correct.
13    Q.   And at no time did you ever
14 tell anybody that you thought those
15 temperatures were unreliable.
16        Did you?
17        MS. PETTY: Objection.
18        MR. FUKUMURA: Objection.
19        THE WITNESS: I don't know what
20    words were expressed. We told them
21    where the temperatures were coming
22    from, that they were not direct tank
23    r e a d i n g s .
24 QUESTIONS BY MR. ELLIS:
25    Q.   You didn't tell anybody that
|Page 331 1 any temperature spikes, did it? 2 MS. PETTY: Objection. 3 THE WITNESS: None of the 4 temperatures we took from the bolster 5 ever varied to any great extent. 6 QUESTIONS BY MR. ELLIS: 7 Q. Okay. It is true, is it not, 8 that GATX95098, the temperatures you took, 9 never had a temperature spike. 10 R ig h t ? 11 A. That's correct. 12 Q. In fact, none of the other four 13 VCM cars, other than 80370, had anything 14 other than something in the high to mid-60s, 15 correct, of the temperatures you took? 16 MS. PETTY: Objection. 17 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 18 THE WITNESS: Of the 19 temperatures taken at the bolster, 20 those temperatures did not have 21 s p ik e s . 22 QUESTIONS BY MR. ELLIS: 23 Q. Okay. The temperatures taken 24 at the bolster, as you say, those were 25 temperatures that you recorded and kept in|Page 333 1 the temperatures were unreliable, did you? 2 MS. PETTY: Objection. 3 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 4 THE WITNESS: No. 5 QUESTIONS BY MR. ELLIS: 6 Q. What's the normal operating 7 temperature of a tank car like GATX95098 when 8 it's loaded with vinyl chloride monomer? 9 A. I would have to check the 10 properties of vinyl chloride to see what 11 its -- what its temperature is when it's in 12 liquid state. 13 Q. Did you check at the time? 14 A. I'm sure we looked on the SDS. 15 Q. My question is -- you say, "I'm 16 sure we looked at the SDS." 17 Do you know that you looked at 18 the SDS to determine what the normal 19 operating temperature of these cars was at 20 that time? 21 A. I do not know that. 22 Q. Did you ask anybody to 23 determine what the normal operating 24 temperature of a car like GATX95098 was when 25 it's loaded with VCM?|

1    A.   I did not ask.
2    Q.   I apologize. I only have two
3 of these, so I'm going to mark it. I'll give
4 mine up to whomever wants to see it, but all
5 I have is two of these.
6        MS. PETTY: We'll take a copy,
7    please.
8        MR. ELLIS: Yeah, let me
9    just -- we're going to stop talking,
10    so maybe I'll do this.
11        MR. FUKUMURA: Do you want to
12    take a break and make -13        MR. ELLIS: Sure. You want to
14    do that?
15        MR. SWANSON: I have copies of
16    this. Is that what it is?
17        MR. ELLIS: Yeah, it surely is.
18        VIDEOGRAPHER: Are we going off
19    the record?
20        MR. ELLIS: Yeah, sure, go off
21    the record.

19        MS. PETTY: Objection.
20        THE WITNESS: They're on the
21    invite, and Helen Hart shared, so...
22 QUESTIONS BY MR. ELLIS:
23    Q.   Certainly your boss' boss
24 attended that meeting.

1 QUESTIONS BY MR. ELLIS:
2    Q.   Did anybody on that call ask
3 whether, in light of this information, you
4 ought to hold off on the vent and burn?
5    A.   I do not recall. I don't
6 even -- I'm not sure I was even on the call.
7 I can't say for sure whether I was or not. I
8 don't recall it.
9    Q.   Did Helen Hart ever ask you,
10 geez, in light of this information, maybe we
11 should hold off on the vent and burn?
12        MR. FUKUMURA: Objection.
13        MS. PETTY: Objection.
14        THE WITNESS: I do not recall
15    that conversation.
16 QUESTIONS BY MR. ELLIS:
17    Q.   Did you ever ask yourself or
18 ask others, in light of the low temperatures
19 on four of the five vinyl chloride cars and
20 the decreasing temperature on the fifth,
21 maybe we ought to hold off on this vent and
22 b u r n ?
23        MS. PETTY: Objection.
24        MR. FUKUMURA: Objection.
25        THE WITNESS: I did not have


1 the contractors you hired and were paying to
2 give you advice, did you ever have a
3 conversation with them, after you got this
4 information and this Teams meeting occurred,
5 whether you should hold off and not perform
6 the vent and burn?
7        MS. PETTY: Objection.
8        MR. FUKUMURA: Objection.
9 QUESTIONS BY MR. ELLIS:
10    Q.   Did you ever have that
11 c o n v e r s a t i o n ?
12    A.   I don't recall that
13 conversation, no.
14    Q.   At any time after you got the
15 information about the low temperatures on the
16 four of the five VCM cars and the decreasing
17 temperature on the fifth, did you ever ask
18 any of your contractors, geez, maybe we ought
19 to hold off and wait a while and not do this
20 vent and burn?
21        MS. PETTY: Objection.
22        MR. FUKUMURA: Objection.
23    Asked and answered.
24        THE WITNESS: I did not have
25    that conversation, no.
|Page 339 1 any such discussion. 2 QUESTIONS BY MR. ELLIS: 3 Q. Did you ever ask any of the 4 folks at SPS or your other contractors 5 whether you ought to hold off on the vent and 6 burn in light of the information you were 7 getting at this time? 8 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 9 MS. PETTY: Objection. 10 THE WITNESS: I don't recall 11 specific conversations we had. One of 12 the conversations we did have with our 13 specialized contractors who were there 14 felt -- they believed the material was 15 polymerizing, and we were 16 absolutely -- feared a catastrophic 17 failure of one car. And if we had 18 one, we figured the problem existed in 19 the others because they were all in 20 the same pool fire. 21 QUESTIONS BY MR. ELLIS: 22 Q. Okay. But that wasn't my 23 q u e s t io n . 24 My question was, did you ever 25 have a conversation with any of the folks,|Page 341 1 QUESTIONS BY MR. ELLIS: 2 Q . You never had any conversation 3 with GATX about whether you should have a 4 vent and burn, did you? 5 A. I did not. 6 Q . You didn't ask GATX whether you 7 could place charges on GATX95098 and blow two 8 holes in it, did you? 9 A. I did not. 10 Q . To your knowledge, did anybody 11 at Norfolk Southern have a conversation with 12 GATX about whether it could blow two holes in 13 G A T X 9 5 0 9 8 ? 14 A. No one to my knowledge. 15 Q. What about afterwards? After 16 you executed the vent and burn, did you think 17 to call GATX and tell it that you'd just 18 executed a vent and burn on GATX95098? 19 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 20 MS. PETTY: Objection. 21 THE WITNESS: I did not 22 personally have conversations with 23 anybody with GATX. They would have 24 been notified through the damaged car 25 system that railroads use, that our|

1    mechanical folks have to use, but I
2    don't know when that occurred or who
3    did it.
4 QUESTIONS BY MR. ELLIS:
5    Q.   Okay. That's an automated
6 system that tells someone if their -- tells a
7 car owner if its car has been damaged and
8 provides some sort of settlement procedure
9 for the value of the car.
10        R i g h t ?
11        MS. PETTY: Objection.
12        MR. FUKUMURA: Objection.
13        THE WITNESS:  That's correct.
14 QUESTIONS BY MR. ELLIS:
15    Q.   Okay. And that's a -- that's a
16 process you're familiar with, given your
17 experience at Norfolk Southern.
18        R i g h t ?
19        MS. PETTY: Objection.
20        THE WITNESS: I know about the
21    process. I have no interaction with
22    that system.
23 QUESTIONS BY MR. ELLIS:
24    Q.   Okay. And other than that
25 process, as far as you know, no one at


1 occurred.
2        Correct?
3    A.   Yes. In excess of a month.
4    Q.   Okay. And what was this about?
5 What was this e-mail about?
6    A.   Norfolk Southern agreed to
7 provide some special training classes in the
8 state of Ohio based out of our Bellevue yard.
9    Q.   Okay. And what kind of special
10 training classes were those?
11    A.   They were unscheduled classes
12 for a normal safety training tour.
13    Q.   Okay. So these were safety
14 training that you were providing to folks in
15 the state of Ohio that were part of your
16 normal training, but you were given extra
17 training.
18        Is that it?
19        MS. PETTY: Objection.
20        THE WITNESS: We were providing
21    additional training in the state of
22    Ohio. I don't know at whose request.
23 QUESTIONS BY MR. ELLIS:
24    Q.   Okay. Who was the training to?
25    A.   First responders.
|Page 343 1 Norfolk Southern ever called GATX to let GATX 2 know that it had executed a vent and burn on 3 G A T X 9 5 0 9 8 . 4 R ig h t? 5 A. Not to my knowledge. 6 Q. Did you ever think that maybe 7 you ought to call GATX and let it know that 8 you were going to execute a vent and burn on 9 the VCM car GATX95098 before you did it? 10 A. I did not. 11 (Wood Exhibit 26 marked for 12 identification.) 13 QUESTIONS BY MR. ELLIS: 14 Q. Okay. Mr. Wood, you've been 15 handed what's been marked as Wood Deposition 16 Exhibit Number 26. 17 A. Yes. 18 Q. The bottom e-mail of these two 19 e-mails on this exhibit is an e-mail from you 20 to several people, the first one Christopher 21 Burch at Norfolk Southern. 22 Is that correct? 23 A. Yes. 24 Q. This is on March 20, 2023, so a 25 couple of weeks after the vent and burn|Page 345 1 Q. So these were first responders 2 throughout the state of Ohio that you were 3 giving training to. You'd normally give that 4 training. This was an additional unscheduled 5 training. 6 Is that right? 7 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 8 THE WITNESS: Yes. We have an 9 NS OAR program that we conduct 10 training at the firehouse level, and 11 then we have the NS safety training. 12 These were additional stops for the NS 13 safety training. 14 QUESTIONS BY MR. ELLIS: 15 Q. Okay. And it was an eight-hour 16 class, it looks like, or at least the one in 17 Bellevue, Ohio, was an eight-hour class. 18 Is that right? 19 A. Yes. 20 Q. And was this you telling 21 your -- the folks who were going to do the 22 training what it ought to cover? 23 A. Yes, what should be emphasized. 24 Q. Okay. And, in fact, you say 25 the eight-hour classes in Bellevue should|

1 cover the following topics.
2        Correct?
3    A.   Yes.
4    Q.   And then you go on to list
5 them - railroad 101, wheel reports and
6 AskRail, et cetera?
7    A.   Yes.
8    Q.   And you added something in red
9 there. "Any discussion regarding East
10 Palestine are to be nonspecific and focus on
11 the same topics as the simulations for any
12 classes taught."
13        Do you see that?
14    A.   Yes.
15    Q.   You added that there?
16    A.   Yes.
17    Q.   And then Paul Williams sends
18 that to Scott Deutsch and says, "Wow, what
19 guidance."
20        Right?
21    A.   Yes.
22    Q.   Okay. And why did you tell
23 them to keep the East Palestine discussion to
24 non-specific training?
25    A.   These were instructions we

11 QUESTIONS BY MR. ELLIS:
12    Q.   If you could look at Wood
13 Exhibit Number 3, that's the HAZMAT factual
14 report.
15    A.   Okay.
16    Q.   Oxy's counsel asked you some
17 questions that specifically were around
18 indications that VCM had released from the
19 valve other than the PRD.
20        Remember those questions?
21    A.   Yes.
22    Q.   And we went off the record for
23 a while, and you were paging through that
24 looking for some evidence.
25        And I think you found something
|Page 347 1 received from the NTSB while an ongoing 2 investigation was going on. 3 Q. Okay. So the NTSB told you not 4 to talk about the East Palestine in any 5 specifics; is that why you put that there? 6 A. Yes. Anything related to 7 cause, anything that we were discussing with 8 NTSB, we were not supposed to discuss outside 9 of that. 10 Q. Okay. Would you look at Wood 11 Exhibit Number 13, please? 12 A. Number 13? 13 Q. Yeah. 14 It's one of those double 15 exhibits. It's got an e-mail, and it's got 16 an attachment analysis report. 17 A. Yes. 18 Q. Do you have that there? 19 A. Yes. 20 Q. Okay. And this had to do with 21 some testing that was done after the 22 derailment to look at tank residue test 23 results and evidence -- or in this case, lack 24 of evidence of polymerization. 25 C o r r e c t ?|Page 349 1 to do with a -- after the vent and burn 2 condition of one of the particular tank cars. 3 Right? 4 MS. PETTY: Objection. 5 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 6 THE WITNESS: The statements 7 were coming from when the valves were 8 in -- were torn down during the NTSB 9 inspection. 10 QUESTIONS BY MR. ELLIS: 11 Q. The statements you were looking 12 at were torn-down valves that were examined 13 after the vent and burn. 14 Right? 15 A. Correct. 16 Q. Okay. And I think you were in 17 the middle of reviewing that document when we 18 came back on the record, and you hadn't been 19 all the way through it. 20 Right? 21 A. Correct. 22 (Wood Exhibit 27 marked for 23 identification.) 24 QUESTIONS BY MR. ELLIS: 25 Q. Okay. I've marked here what's|

1 Wood Exhibit Number 27. I'd like you to
2 attach to that anything you find in that that
3 is further evidence of VCM being released
4 from the valve other than the PRD. You can
5 do it anytime. You don't have to do it now.
6 That's the exhibit.
7        MR. ELLIS: And with that, I
8    don't have any further questions for
9    you.
10        MR. FUKUMURA: You mean -- just
11    so we're clear, after the deposition?
12        MR. ELLIS: Sure.
13        MR. FUKUMURA: Okay.
14        THE WITNESS: Okay.
15        MR. ELLIS: I don't have
16    anything further.
17        VIDEOGRAPHER: Need to go off
18    the record? Need to go off the record
19    for a moment?
20        MR. SWANSON: Yeah. Can we so
21    I can switch?
22        VIDEOGRAPHER: We are now going
23    off the video record. The time is
24    currently 4:06 p.m.
25     (Off the record at 4:06 p.m.)


1        You know that generally, right?
2    A.   Yes.
3    Q.   Now, you agree with me, I
4 think, that the five VCM cars that were
5 involved in the derailment were situated
6 differently and they reacted differently to
7 the conditions that they faced.
8        True?
9        MS. PETTY: Objection.
10        THE WITNESS: I'm not exactly
11    sure what you're asking me.
12 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:
13    Q.   Well, I'm saying it's not fair
14 to equate all the VCM cars as acting the same
15 throughout the derailment, because they
16 didn't.
17        Right?
18        MS. PETTY: Objection.
19        THE WITNESS: They were all in
20    the derailment, and at some point in
21    time all of their PRDs activated.
22 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:
23    Q.   Well, I'm going to -- I'm going
24 to ask you about that.
25        So going back to -- I call it
|Page 351 1 VIDEOGRAPHER: We are now back 2 on the video record. The time is 3 currently 4:07 p.m. 4 DIRECT EXAMINATION 5 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON: 6 Q. Mr. Wood, good afternoon. My 7 name is Brian Swanson, and I represent 8 Trinity. 9 Most of my questions today are 10 going to relate to car TILX402025. 11 You recognize that VCM car, 12 correct? 13 A. Yes, I believe that's it. 14 Q. That car was a car that was 15 owned by Trinity and leased to Oxy Vinyls. 16 Are you familiar with that? 17 A. Yes. 18 Q. Okay. And that was one of the 19 VCM cars that was involved in the derailment. 20 Correct? 21 A. Yes. 22 Q. Now, throughout your testimony 23 today, there was a lot of reference to the 24 VCM cars and what the VCM cars did and how 25 the VCM cars acted.|Page 353 1 2025. Can I refer to it as 2025 as 2 shorthand? Will you know what I'm talking 3 about? 4 A. The TILX car? 5 Q. Correct. 6 A. Yes, that's fine. 7 Q. Okay. And I've also seen it 8 sometimes referred to as Car 26. 9 Are you familiar with Car 26 10 from the derailment? 11 A. No, not right offhand, but if 12 you say that's the car, okay. 13 Q. Well, we may see references, 14 but if you have any questions, you just let 15 know. 16 Okay? 17 A. Good. 18 Q. Fair enough. 19 TILX402025 didn't breach upon 20 derailment. 21 Did it? 22 A. It did not. 23 Q. Didn't breach until Norfolk 24 Southern detonated it in the vent and burn on 25 February 6th.|

-----

1        Right?
2    A.   Correct.
3    Q.   And you know, I think, that
4 Trinity's 402025 was not exposed to the same
5 pool fires as the other VCM cars were.
6        Did you know that, sir?
7        MS. PETTY: Objection.
8        THE WITNESS: All of the vinyl
9    chloride cars were exposed to fire.
10 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:
11    Q.   All right. Let's, if you can,
12 please, pull out Exhibit 3.
13        MR. FUKUMURA: He'll give the
14    page. It's a big one.
15 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:
16    Q.   It's a big one, and I think
17 it's probably the only one I'm going to use
18 with this. You can keep it in front of you.
19        Okay?
20        What I'm going to do, since I
21 have a different copy, is I'm going to refer
22 to the pages at the bottom.
23        Do you see there where it says
24 page blank of 158?
25    A.   Yes.


1    Q.   You understand that's the
2 Trinity car that I referred to at the outset
3 of my questioning?
4    A.   Yes.
5    Q.   "The SPSI president recalled it
6 was not remarkable."
7        Did I read that correctly, sir?
8    A.   Yes.
9    Q.   Do you recall when you were on
10 the ground in East Palestine between
11 February 3rd and February 6th that the folks
12 at SPSI were able to attach a pressure gauge
13 to Trinity's car?
14    A.   Yes.
15    Q.   Do you recall that the readings
16 they got from that pressure gauge were not
17 remarkable?
18        MS. PETTY: Objection.
19        THE WITNESS: Yes. Yes.
20 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:
21    Q.   The next sentence reads, "This
22 tank car had not been subjected to pool fire
23 conditions."
24        Did I read that correctly?
25    A.   You did read that correctly.
|Page 355 1 Q. Okay. Can you please, sir, 2 turn to page 80 of 158? 3 A. Yes. 4 Q. About three-quarters of the way 5 down, there's a paragraph that begins "At 6 that point." 7 Do you see that? 8 Do you see that paragraph, sir? 9 A. Yes. Yes. 10 Q. Okay. And this is from the 11 factual report that -- that you were on 12 the team that put this together. 13 Right? 14 MS. PETTY: Objection. 15 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 16 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON: 17 Q. Right, sir? 18 A. Yes. 19 Q. All right. The second sentence 20 of that paragraph reads, "Crews were able to 21 access one of the angle valves on the 22 eastern-most VCM car, 28, TILX402025, to test 23 the tank pressure." 24 Did I read that correctly, sir? 25 A. Yes.|Page 357 1 Q. Do you have any reason to 2 question the accuracy of that statement that 3 went in the report? 4 A. The car received fire damage. 5 Q. My question is, do you have any 6 reason to question the accuracy of the 7 statement that Trinity's 402025 had not been 8 subjected to pool fire conditions? 9 MS. PETTY: Objection. 10 THE WITNESS: According to Drew 11 McCarty, it was not. 12 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON: 13 Q. And Drew McCarty was on the 14 scene. 15 Right? 16 A. Correct. 17 Q. He was -- he -- as between you 18 and Mr. McCarty, Mr. McCarty spent a lot more 19 time at the derailment site with the cars 20 than you did. 21 Didn't he, sir? 22 MS. PETTY: Objection. 23 THE WITNESS: That's correct. 24 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON: 25 Q. And you're not saying that Drew|
|---|---|


-----

1 McCarty was being untruthful when he reported
2 that 2025 hadn't been subjected to pool
3 fires.
4        Are you?
5    A.   I have no reason to question
6 what he said here.
7    Q.   And what he said here is that
8 2025 had not been subjected to pool fire
9 conditions.
10        Correct, sir?
11    A.   That's what he said.
12    Q.   And you've testified that you
13 knew about the pressure gauge that you guys
14 were able to put on to 2025.
15        Right?
16    A.   Correct.
17    Q.   If you can flip, please, to
18 page 82 of 158.
19        Very last word on that page is
20 "crews."
21        Do you see that?
22    A.   Yes.
23    Q.   It reads, "Crews attached a
24 pressure gauge to TILX402025 and found a tank
25 pressure of 60 PSIG."


1    Q.   And we've also seen that
2 pressure -- or excuse me, temperature
3 readings were taken on 2025.
4        Right?
5        MS. PETTY: Objection.
6        THE WITNESS: Yes, a pressure
7    reading was taken.
8 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:
9    Q.   Temperature readings were taken
10 on 2025.
11        Correct?
12        MS. PETTY: Objection.
13        THE WITNESS: From the
14    bolsters, yes.
15 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:
16    Q.   Yeah. And it seems you don't
17 really want to own all those temperature
18 readings you were taking and sending on to
19 your bosses.
20        Right? You want to say they're
21 unreliable in litigation now?
22        MS. PETTY: Objection.
23        MR. FUKUMURA: Objection.
24        THE WITNESS: No. I'm saying
25    that's the only temperatures we could
|Page 359 1 Did I read that correctly? 2 A. Yes. 3 Q. You understand, I assume, that 4 60 PSIG is a normal reading for a stabilized 5 vinyl chloride monomer in a tank car. 6 Right, sir? 7 MS. PETTY: Objection. 8 THE WITNESS: I'm sorry, repeat 9 the question. 10 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON: 11 Q. You understand that 60 PSIG is 12 a normal reading for a stabilized vinyl 13 chloride monomer in a tank car. 14 Don't you, sir? 15 MS. PETTY: Objection. 16 THE WITNESS: I do not. 17 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON: 18 Q. You don't know one way or the 19 other? 20 A. No. 21 Q. But you do know that 22 Mr. McCarty found that 65 -- or 60 PSIG to be 23 unremarkable, right? That's what he 24 reported? 25 A. That's what he reported.|Page 361 1 get. 2 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON: 3 Q. Well, if you had a pressure 4 reading from Trinity's car 2025, you 5 understand that pressure readings correspond 6 to temperatures. 7 Right? 8 A. Yes. 9 Q. So if you wanted to figure out 10 if your temperature readings on the cars were 11 accurate, one thing you could have done was 12 use the pressure to determine that. 13 Right? 14 A. Yes. 15 Q. Is that something you did? 16 A. The valves were inaccessible 17 and unoperable on the other cars. Wouldn't 18 allow for pressure gauges. 19 Q. Well, it did allow for it on 20 the Trinity car, didn't it, sir? 21 A. It did. 22 Q. And it showed you that the 23 temperatures you were getting on the Trinity 24 car were accurate, didn't it? 25 MS. PETTY: Objection.|

1        THE WITNESS: I have no reason
2    to question the temperatures we got
3    off the bolsters of the car.
4 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:
5    Q.   Okay. So I want to focus on
6 the Trinity car.
7        Okay, sir?
8    A.   Yeah.
9    Q.   You knew what the temperature
10 readings were.
11        Right? Yes?
12    A.   Yes.
13        MS. PETTY: Objection.
14 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:
15    Q.   You knew what the pressure
16 readings were on the Trinity car.
17        Right?
18    A.   Yes.
19    Q.   The pressure and temperature
20 readings from Trinity's 2025 were in no way
21 indicative of polymerization occurring in
22 that car, were they, sir?
23        MS. PETTY: Objection.
24        THE WITNESS: I have no way to
25    indicate that that was the case.


1        Right?
2        MS. PETTY: Objection.
3        THE WITNESS: That was part of
4    the decision tree, and, yes,
5    originally we did believe that.
6 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:
7    Q.   Right.
8        What you wanted to do with the
9 Trinity car, 2025, was put it back on the
10 tracks and send it on its way.
11        Right, sir?
12        MS. PETTY: Objection.
13        THE WITNESS: That's correct.
14 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:
15    Q.   And I'm going to give Norfolk
16 Southern the benefit of the doubt that you
17 wouldn't have contemplated doing that if you
18 thought there was any risk of polymerization.
19        Right, sir?
20        MS. PETTY: Objection.
21        THE WITNESS: That's correct.
22 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:
23    Q.   Norfolk Southern wouldn't have
24 considered re-railing Trinity's 2025 if it
25 believed there was any concern about a
|Page 363 1 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON: 2 Q. You have no way to indicate 3 that polymerization was occurring in the 4 Trinity car. 5 Right, sir? 6 MS. PETTY: Objection. 7 THE WITNESS: Correct. 8 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON: 9 Q. The pressure and temperature 10 readings that you received from the TILX 2025 11 car were in no way indicative of a potential 12 BLEVE. 13 Were they, sir? 14 MS. PETTY: Objection. 15 THE WITNESS: No. 16 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON: 17 Q. They were not, right? 18 MS. PETTY: Objection. 19 THE WITNESS: That's correct. 20 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON: 21 Q. And you know, based on the 22 pressure and temperature readings of 23 Trinity's 2025, that Norfolk Southern and its 24 contractors believed the car was a candidate 25 for re-railing.|Page 365 1 potential BLEVE. 2 Right? 3 A. That's correct. 4 Q. What you know, based on the 5 pressure and temperature readings of 6 Trinity's 2025, was that that car was stable. 7 Wasn't it, sir? 8 MS. PETTY: Objection. 9 THE WITNESS: At the time it 10 was observed, that's correct. 11 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON: 12 Q. That car was stable right up to 13 the moment that you detonated it in the vent 14 and burn. 15 Wasn't it, sir? 16 MS. PETTY: Objection. 17 THE WITNESS: That's correct. 18 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON: 19 Q. What you know, based on the 20 temperature and pressure readings that you 21 took from Trinity's 2025, was that that car 22 performed exactly as it was built to perform 23 in a derailment. 24 Didn't it, sir? 25 MS. PETTY: Objection.|

-----

1        MR. FUKUMURA: Objection.
2        THE WITNESS: That's correct.
3 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:
4    Q.   And what you know from those
5 pressure and temperature readings
6 specifically is that the pressure release
7 device on 2025 acted exactly as it should in
8 a derailment.
9        Correct?
10        MS. PETTY: Objection.
11        MR. FUKUMURA: Objection.
12        THE WITNESS: That's correct.
13 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:
14    Q.   Now, I've seen evidence in the
15 factual report we've been talking about that
16 the reason Norfolk Southern didn't re-rail
17 Trinity's 2025 car was because of a damaged
18 bolster.
19        Is that your understanding?
20        MS. PETTY: Objection.
21        THE WITNESS: No.
22 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:
23    Q.   Okay. Let's turn, if we could,
24 to page 85 of 158.
25    A.   Yes.


1        Did I read that correctly?
2    A.   Yes.
3    Q.   Is it true that the reason
4 Norfolk Southern did not re-rail 2025 was
5 because its bolster was allegedly damaged?
6    A.   The bolster damage may have
7 prevented re-railing. It doesn't say we
8 couldn't move it, but the wrecking
9 contractors refused to touch these cars.
10    Q.   Well, let me take this in
11 pieces. Okay? I want you to first answer my
12 question.
13        The reason Norfolk Southern did
14 not re-rail 2025 is because of an allegedly
15 damaged bolster.
16        Correct?
17        MS. PETTY: Objection.
18        THE WITNESS: That's the
19    statement here.
20 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:
21    Q.   And you have no reason to
22 question that statement.
23        Correct?
24        MS. PETTY: Objection.
25        THE WITNESS: I do not.
|Page 367 1 Q. Are you there, sir? 2 A. Yeah. 3 Q. Midway through that page, there 4 is a paragraph that begins "Following that." 5 Do you see that? 6 A. Yes. 7 Q. It reads, "Following that, SRS 8 crews" -- 9 That's Mr. Day's organization, 10 right? 11 A. Yes. 12 Q. -- "SRS crews assisted with 13 moving burning hopper cars away from the east 14 end so the crews could attempt to re-rail VCM 15 car TILX402025 because the car was determined 16 to be stable with a pressure of 60 PSIG." 17 Did I read that correctly? 18 A. Yes. 19 Q. That's a true statement based 20 on what you just testified about. 21 Right, sir? 22 A. Yes. 23 Q. "Re-railing this VCM car was 24 not possible because of damage to the bolster 25 assemblies on both sides of the car."|Page 369 1 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON: 2 Q. Now, you said -- you said that 3 the reason -- well, let me take a step back. 4 One thing that you can do as a 5 railroad company in a derailment where there 6 are derailed cars is you can move them out of 7 harm's way. 8 Right? 9 A. That's correct. 10 Q. There might be fires. You can 11 move cars away from the fires so that they 12 don't heat up their cars. 13 Right? 14 A. Correct. 15 Q. And you had wrecking crews on 16 site here that were capable of moving train 17 cars, generally. 18 Right? 19 A. Yes. 20 Q. And they did, in fact, move 21 different cars out of harm's way. 22 Correct? 23 A. Yes. 24 Q. And what was the name of this 25 wrecking company that you're referring to?|
|---|---|


-----

1    A.   There was more than one
2 wrecking company, and I believe R.J. Corman
3 was there. There may have been Hulcher and
4 Cranemasters. I honestly don't know all the
5 wrecking contractors that are there.
6    Q.   And then what you volunteered
7 in response to my question is that your
8 wrecking companies wouldn't move any of the
9 VCM cars.
10        Is that your testimony?
11    A.   That was the message relayed to
12 me.
13    Q.   So you don't know -- nothing
14 was told to you directly; you're relying on
15 what other people told you.
16        Is that fair?
17    A.   Yes. The wrecking contractors
18 work for our mechanical department, so any
19 communication they would have had would have
20 been with the mechanical.
21    Q.   And who's with -- who's the
22 mechanical department?
23    A.   I believe Josiah Saxe was out
24 there then, but I don't know that as fact.
25    Q.   All right. No one told you


1 can, but we can't, so let's move it rather
2 than blowing it up?
3        MS. PETTY: Objection.
4        THE WITNESS: They didn't want
5    to move it because of its proximity to
6    three other VCM cars that were
7    directly near it.
8        Where they would have to get to
9    move that car, they had to get
10    directly adjacent to those cars.
11 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:
12    Q.   The pressure gauge that went on
13 2025 that showed a pressure reading of
14 60 PSIG, that went on on the 4th.
15        You know that, right?
16    A.   Yes.
17    Q.   And then there were two days
18 between the 4th and the time that Norfolk
19 Southern blew up that car that anybody from
20 your wrecking crew could have come in and
21 moved that car.
22        Right, sir?
23        MS. PETTY: Objection.
24        THE WITNESS: No wrecking crews
25    entered the site until the fires were
|Page 371 1 directly why these wrecking companies 2 allegedly would not move any of the VCM cars. 3 Fair? 4 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 5 MS. PETTY: Objection. 6 THE WITNESS: Yes, I believe 7 Drew McCarty was there when the 8 conversation happened. 9 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON: 10 Q. And what reason were you told 11 for the wrecking companies refusing to move 12 any of the VCM cars? 13 A. Because of the fears that had 14 been expressed that we thought the cars were 15 polymerizing. 16 Q. Well, wait a second, sir. 17 You just told me that Norfolk 18 Southern was ready to re-rail 2025 because it 19 was stable. 20 Right? 21 A. Yes. 22 Q. So did anybody tell your 23 wrecking crews that regardless of what's 24 going on in these other four VCM cars, we've 25 got a stable car here that we'd re-rail if we|Page 373 1 basically out or down to smoldering. 2 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON: 3 Q. Right. 4 And what happened is we on 5 page 85, is that the wrecking crews were in 6 close proximity to 2025 because they were 7 moving other cars so you could re-rail it. 8 Right, sir? 9 A. Yes. They were moving the cars 10 directly east. 11 Q. Right. 12 And it didn't occur to anybody 13 while they were there to hook up an 14 attachment to 2025 and move it out of the way 15 instead of blowing up the car and releasing 16 all that VCM into the environment? 17 MS. PETTY: Objection. 18 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 19 THE WITNESS: Again, as it was 20 stated to me, the wrecking contractors 21 refused to move any of those cars 22 because of its proximity to the other 23 cars. 24 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON: 25 Q. Did the wrecking cars {sic}|
|---|---|


-----

1 know that Norfolk Southern had determined
2 that 2025 was stable?
3        MS. PETTY: Objection.
4        THE WITNESS: I do not know.
5 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:
6    Q.   You're not sure if anybody told

I want to ask you about your 3 contractors at SPSI and SRS. 4 It sounds like from your 5 testimony that you didn't consider yourself 6 to be an expert in stabilized VCM. 7 Is that fair? 8 A. That's correct. 9 Q. Or in venting and burning 10 o p e r a t io n s . 11 R ig h t ? 12 A. That's correct. 13 Q. And I take it from your 14 testimony and other information I've seen 15 that you relied on Mr. Day and Mr. McCarty to 16 advise on how to handle these VCM tank cars. 17 Is that fair? 18 A. That's correct. They are 19 CHLOREP contractors. 20 Q. Okay. Did you rely on one more 21 than the other? 22 A. No, I don't think so. 23 Q. You believed, or were led to 24 believe, that Mr. Day had experiences in both 25 VCM and venting and burning.|

12    Q.   Now, in electing to rely on
13 Mr. Day, can you tell us what specific
14 experience he had working with stabilized
15 vinyl chloride monomers in a derailment?
16    A.   I don't know all of Chip's
17 experience over the years, his decades of
18 experience, but he is the leader of one of
19 their CHLOREP teams. There are like three
20 CHLOREP contractors in the whole United
21 States. Two of them were on our site. SPSI
22 is a CHLOREP contractor. SRS is a CHLOREP

1 contractor for a derailment in Paulsboro, New
2 Jersey -3    Q.   Okay.
4    A.   -- that involved a breached
5 vinyl chloride car.
6    Q.   Okay. Did that -- did that
7 derailment involve a vent and burn of that
8 c a r ?
9    A.   It did not.
10    Q.   So can you tell us what
11 experience, if any, Mr. McCarty had venting
12 and burning vinyl chloride monomers?
13    A.   I cannot.
14    Q.   Can you tell us what experience
15 Mr. McCarty had, if any, regarding vinyl
16 chloride monomer potentially polymerizing?
17    A.   His experience?
18    Q.   Specific experience dealing
19 with vinyl chloride monomer polymerization.
20    A.   I do not.
21    Q.   Can you tell us what experience

25 experience, if any, Mr. McCarty had with


1    A.   That's correct.
2    Q.   Can you tell the jury what an
3 angle valve is on a tank car?
4    A.   An angle valve is a style of
5 valve, usually a loading or offloading valve
6 or a vapor valve on the car. The angle valve
7 just describes the design of the valve.
8    Q.   Right.
9        And on 2025, you knew that the
10 function of the angle valve was to load and
11 unload vinyl chloride monomer into that car.
12        Right?
13    A.   Correct.
14    Q.   The angle valve is a valve that
15 Oxy used to put VCM into 2025 and then sent
16 it on its way.
17        Right?
18    A.   That's correct.
19    Q.   Angle valve is the valve that
20 Oxy would have used had the train reached its
21 destination to offload the vinyl chloride
22 monomer from that car.
23        Right, sir?
24    A.   The liquid angle valves, yes.
25    Q.   Right.
|Page 383 1 hot-tapping vinyl chloride monomer cars? 2 A. I cannot. 3 Q. Can you tell us what experience 4 Mr. McCarty had, if any, offloading vinyl 5 chloride monomer through a tank car's valves 6 following a derailment? 7 A. I cannot. 8 Q. And I take it you didn't do any 9 comparison of Mr. McCarty's experience to the 10 subject matter experts you had access to in 11 Dallas from Oxy Vinyls. 12 True, sir? 13 MS. PETTY: Objection. 14 THE WITNESS: I did not. 15 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON: 16 Q. I had shown you before the 17 factual report where you saw that crews were 18 able to access one of the angle valves on 19 2025. 20 You recall that, sir? 21 A. Yes. 22 Q. And by attaching a pressure 23 gauge to the angle valve, they were able to 24 get pressure readings from that car. 25 Right?|Page 385 1 And on this -- on 2025, you 2 know the angle valve was accessible because 3 you put a pressure gauge on it. 4 Right? 5 A. Well, there are three angle 6 valves. Some have -- some have three. I 7 believe these had three angle valves - one 8 vapor, two liquid lines. I'd have to go look 9 at the car, you know, the records of the car 10 to see. 11 Q. Right. 12 A. There's actually three angle 13 valves. 14 Q. You put a pressure gauge on one 15 of the angle valves. 16 Right? 17 A. Yes. 18 Q. Now, was there any discussion 19 about using that angle valve that was 20 functioning to take pressure readings, using 21 that angle valve to offload VCM from the 22 Trinity car rather than blowing it up and 23 spouting 170,000 pounds of VCM into the 24 environment? 25 Any discussion of that at all,|

17 team was, we're going to vent and burn all
18 five cars.
19        Right?
20    A.   No.
21    Q.   Your recommendation -- you
22 believed it was necessary. Norfolk Southern
23 and your contractors believed it was
24 necessary to vent and burn all five VCM cars.
25        Right?

I don't know we discussed the 7 number of cars at that time. I really don't. 8 Q. Well, you knew that that vent 9 and burn wouldn't happen if Chief Drabick 10 didn't sign off. 11 Right? 12 A. Yes. 13 Q. When you went in and -- so your 14 job was to try to convince Chief Drabick that 15 it was the appropriate decision based on what 16 you were seeing and what the contractor was 17 seeing. 18 Right, sir? 19 MS.
