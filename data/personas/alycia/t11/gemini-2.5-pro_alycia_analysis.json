  "chunk_0-0": "Immediately interrupt to correct the court reporter's error on the record, clarifying that Mr. Wood is testifying on behalf of Norfolk Southern Railway Company, not Trinity Industries Leasing Company, to ensure his testimony is unambiguously binding on the correct corporate entity.",
  "chunk_0-1": "Take a break to confer with the witness to clarify the full scope of documents he reviewed; his current answer mischaracterizes his preparation and exposes the company to a motion arguing he is an unprepared deponent.",
  "chunk_0-2": "Object that the line of questioning invades the work product doctrine by inquiring into counsel's selection of documents for witness preparation, and instruct the witness not to answer.",
  "chunk_0-3": "Call for a break to instruct my witness to immediately clarify their answer regarding the NTSB report. They must state that their role is not to adopt or disagree with the NTSB\u2019s preliminary findings but to testify only on the specific noticed topics, leveraging the fact they only \u201cscanned\u201d the full report and that it isn\u2019t final.",
  "chunk_0-4": "Make eye contact with my client to non-verbally reinforce our preparation, ensuring they are centered and ready before the first substantive question is asked.",
  "chunk_0-5": "Take an immediate break to instruct the witness to stop adopting the questioner's loaded characterizations (\"armor,\" \"survivable\") and to answer only by referencing the objective, technical DOT specifications.",
  "chunk_0-6": "Take an immediate break to disrupt opposing counsel's rhythm and prepare the witness for the inevitable follow-up question, \"What is correct?\", ensuring their answer is simple, factual, and closes the door on this topic.",
  "chunk_0-7": "Object to the form of the question. The phrase \"blew them up\" is argumentative, prejudicial, and mischaracterizes the controlled vent and burn procedure. Instruct the witness not to answer until counsel rephrases the question using precise, non-prejudicial terminology.",
  "chunk_0-8": "On redirect, I will have the witness distinguish between a release from a Pressure Relief Device and the release he mentioned from \"angle valves on the cars from damage due to fire,\" establishing the latter was an uncontrolled component failure, not a safety system functioning as designed.",
  "chunk_0-9": "Pivot any follow-up questioning away from the device's proper mechanical activation and toward the upstream system failure or abnormal conditions that *caused* the pressure release.",
  "chunk_0-10": "On redirect, I will have the witness identify every person included in his \"among others\" answer and describe precisely which reports or communications from those individuals form the basis of his testimony, since he has no first-hand knowledge.",
  "chunk_0-11": "On redirect, ask the witness to clarify what specific population of vinyl chloride cars they were referring to with their use of the word \"all,\" limiting the scope of that absolute statement.",
  "chunk_0-12": "On redirect, I will immediately question the witness about the condition and post-derailment testing of the *liquid* angle valves on the Trinity car, directly contrasting it with the testimony elicited about the operational vapor valve.",
  "chunk_0-13": "Focus on *why* the angle valve could measure pressure but not temperature, thereby establishing the technical basis for the witness's distinction and preventing opposing counsel from conflating the two concepts again.",
  "chunk_0-14": "Instruct the witness to answer only based on their specific expertise and role, and not to testify about general scientific principles they weren't trained on.",
  "chunk_0-15": "Object to the form of the question as it is incomplete and leading, and instruct my witness not to answer until a proper question is asked.",
  "chunk_0-16": "On redirect, I will ask the witness to describe in exhaustive detail exactly what he means by \"fire damage,\" focusing only on his personal, sensory observations to build an independent factual record that makes the term \"pool fire\" irrelevant.",
  "chunk_0-17": "Take a break to instruct the witness that he must stop and wait for my signal to answer anytime an objection is made, as his failure to do so is the most critical procedural risk we face.",
  "chunk_0-18": "On redirect, use the NTSB report to establish the precise time the 60 PSI measurement was taken and contrast it with the timeline of the active fire, confirming that no temperature or pressure data exists for the period the car was actually exposed to the fire.",
  "chunk_0-19": "Object for lack of foundation, given the witness has testified he hasn't reviewed the report, and instruct him not to answer questions that require him to interpret or characterize a document he did not prepare.",
  "chunk_0-20": "Focus on preparing a redirect examination to contextualize the temperature data, questioning the equipment's calibration and comparing the Trinity car's readings to those from other relevant vehicles.",
  "chunk_0-21": "On redirect, I will provide the witness with the document listing the temperatures and ask them to review it, then ask, \"Now that you've had a chance to review the log itself, was every single entry 65 degrees or less, or were there some exceptions?\"",
  "chunk_0-22": "Object to the form of the question. It improperly asks the witness to adopt counsel's characterization (\"Is it fair to say...\") rather than testify to a fact.",
  "chunk_0-23": "On redirect, establish that the reason the temperature was unknown on February 3rd and 4th is precisely because the \"significant active fires\" made it physically impossible and unsafe for any personnel to approach the car to obtain a measurement.",
  "chunk_0-24": "My next strategic focus is to lock down the testimony that measurement was impossible. I will prepare the witness to elaborate on the specific, objective dangers of the \"active fires\" that made it unsafe for anyone to approach the cars, thereby turning opposing counsel's attempted point about a \"failure to measure\" into proof of my client's reasonable safety precautions.",
  "chunk_0-25": "On redirect, establish *why* no one from Norfolk Southern measured the temperature, focusing specifically on whether it was unsafe to approach the car or if another entity was responsible for that task.",
  "chunk_0-26": "On my examination, I will deconstruct that compound question to sever the conclusory term \"normal\" from the factual assertion about loading temperature, forcing the witness to clarify what, exactly, their \"Yes\" was intended to affirm.",
  "chunk_0-27": "Ask opposing counsel to clarify whether the question is directed to the witness\u2019s personal knowledge or to the corporate record as a whole.",
  "chunk_0-28": "On redirect, I will establish the precise foundation for the February 5th date. The witness's use of \"would have been\" is an ambiguity that I must clarify to determine if their knowledge comes from memory, a document, or speculation, thereby controlling the record on that fact.",
  "chunk_0-29": "Prepare for re-direct examination to establish the precise, limited scope of SPSI\u2019s engagement, emphasizing their independence to dismantle opposing counsel\u2019s attempt to establish broad agency via the \"hired contractor\" label.",
  "chunk_0-30": "Use the NTSB report to establish that a \"normal\" pressure reading is irrelevant in the face of the known, imminent, and escalating risk of a runaway polymerization reaction, which was the actual basis for the decision-making.",
  "chunk_0-31": "Ask opposing counsel to read the full sentence from the document to ensure the record is complete and the question is not misleading.",
  "chunk_0-32": "Call for a break to reinstruct my witness to listen carefully to the precise question and answer only that question, without volunteering background or explanatory information.",
  "chunk_0-33": "On redirect, I will introduce the official engineering schematic of the railcar and have the witness confirm that his description of the bolster is consistent with the diagram, thereby anchoring his testimony to an authoritative, indisputable document.",
  "chunk_0-34": "On my examination, I will systematically dismantle the \"foundation of a house\" analogy by asking the witness to list all the critical ways the body bolster's function, design, and materials differ from that of a building's foundation, thereby neutralizing the dangerous oversimplification.",
  "chunk_0-35": "Define the term \"set of trucks\" and its specific function in relation to the \"tank car.\"",
  "chunk_0-36": "On redirect, immediately re-frame the concept of \"performance\" by distinguishing between the car's structural integrity post-derailment and the imminent, catastrophic threat it posed while being subjected to prolonged fire, focusing questioning on the temperature of the steel, the state of the pressure relief device, and the risk of a BLEVE.",
  "chunk_0-37": "At the next break, I will praise the witness for introducing the critical concept of variable damage instead of accepting the generalization, and then prepare them for the inevitable follow-up questions that will attempt to minimize those differences.",
  "chunk_0-38": "On the next break, I will praise the witness for expertly narrowing the questioner's vague premise, and instruct them to maintain that precise factual distinction\u2014\"specific to vinyl chloride cars\" and \"least damage\"\u2014if the topic is revisited.",
  "chunk_0-39": "On redirect, question the witness to identify which specific \"contractors\" they were referring to and to define precisely what the term \"stable\" means in the context of their specific evaluations, thereby limiting the scope of the admission.",
