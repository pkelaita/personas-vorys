  "chunk_0-1": "Take an immediate break to confer with my witness. I need to get off the record and understand why he has not reviewed any of the company's own internal documents, as his admission guts the entire purpose of his 30(b)(6) testimony and exposes the company to significant risk.",
  "chunk_0-2": "On redirect, I will clarify that \"available to me\" means the witness had access to all depositions produced in the matter and that they personally decided which ones were pertinent, not that their access was limited by counsel or anyone else.",
  "chunk_0-3": "At the first opportunity, rehabilitate the witness\u2019s adoption of the NTSB report. My questioning will focus on breaking down his general agreement: \u201cMr. Witness, you stated you have no disagreement with the NTSB\u2019s factual report. To be clear, are you adopting every single sentence in that preliminary document as the company\u2019s official position, or are there specific facts you can confirm while others remain subject to the NTSB\u2019s final investigation and our own review?\u201d",

I would then ask what G-forces, impact types, and fire temperatures the \"armor\" and \"thermal protection\" were actually designed and certified to withstand, in order to contextualize the car's failure as a result of the derailment's extreme forces, not an inherent defect.",
