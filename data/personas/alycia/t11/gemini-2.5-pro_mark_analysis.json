  "chunk_0-0": "Immediately interrupt the proceedings to correct the court reporter's error on the record, stating for clarity that the witness, Mr. Wood, is appearing on behalf of Norfolk Southern Railway Company, not Trinity Industries Leasing Company as mistakenly recorded during the swearing-in.",
  "chunk_0-1": "My next focus is to build a record that nullifies the attack on my witness's preparation by systematically linking each person he spoke with to a specific topic in the deposition notice. On redirect, or through clarifying questions if permitted, I will ask for each name he listed: \"What is [Scott Deutsch's] specific role at the company, and which of the noticed topics for today's deposition is he the most knowledgeable person on?\"",
  "chunk_0-2": "Object on the grounds of attorney work product doctrine and instruct the witness not to answer any questions about the process or criteria used to select which documents were made \"available\" for their review.",
  "chunk_0-3": "Let's go back to your preparation. Who selected the depositions of Drew McCarty and Chip Day for your review, and for what purpose were you asked to review those specific testimonies?",
  "chunk_0-4": "Reinforce to my client our core instruction: listen to the full question, pause before you speak, and answer only the specific question that was asked.",
  "chunk_0-5": "My next line of questioning will focus on the specific engineering purpose and documented limitations of each safety feature, moving beyond counsel's characterization of \"armor\" to establish what these components are\u2014and are not\u2014designed to withstand in a derailment scenario.",
  "chunk_0-6": "Instruct the witness to clarify their answer by asking, \"Can you please explain why that is not correct?\"",
  "chunk_0-7": "Object to the form of the question as argumentative and for its gross mischaracterization of the event. I will instruct my witness not to adopt the inflammatory and inaccurate language \"blew them up,\" and to only answer a question rephrased with precise, neutral terminology describing the actual controlled procedure.",
  "chunk_0-8": "On redirect, have the witness explain the difference between a Pressure Relief Device functioning as designed and a release from an angle valve seat failing due to fire damage, thereby clarifying that not all safety components worked as expected.",
  "chunk_0-9": "Drill down on the distinction between the device's function and the system's failure by asking: \"While the device is designed to release pressure, was the overall system designed to ever get to a point where it had to vent hazardous material just to keep from exploding?\"",
  "chunk_0-10": "Debrief my witness to immediately identify every individual included in the \"among others\" who inspected the car. This allows me to map the entire universe of fact witnesses, understand the complete architecture of the inspection process, and ensure no surprise witnesses emerge later.",
  "chunk_0-11": "Describe the function and purpose of an angle valve on these cars generally, before we discuss any specific car.",
  "chunk_0-12": "You've confirmed the vapor valve was operational. What was the condition of the liquid angle valve on the Trinity car after the derailment, and was it also tested?",
  "chunk_0-13": "Systematically break down the witness's distinction: first, have him describe the exact, step-by-step process and equipment used to get a pressure reading from the valve, and then explain the precise technical reason that same process or equipment cannot be used to measure temperature, forcing him to establish the correct procedure.",
  "chunk_0-14": "Object on the grounds that the question calls for scientific or expert knowledge that the witness has not been qualified to provide, and instruct the witness they should only answer based on their personal training or experience, not on abstract scientific principles.",
  "chunk_0-15": "Object to the question's form as leading and instruct the witness to wait for a proper, non-leading question before answering.",
  "chunk_0-16": "On redirect, I will have the witness \"paint the scene\" by describing in granular, sensory detail the exact \"fire damage\" they personally observed, contrasting their direct, factual account with the undefined, technical label of \"pool fire\" to undermine opposing counsel's attempt to minimize the event.",
  "chunk_0-17": "At the next available opportunity, I would confirm with my witness that their definition of a \"pool of burning liquid\" is a neutral, technical one, and that they have not offered any testimony whatsoever as to the *source* of that liquid, thereby locking in their precise answer and walling off the opponent's attempt to attribute it to another vehicle.",
  "chunk_0-18": "Focus on establishing the limitations of the post-event data. Systematically question the witness to confirm that a 60 PSI pressure reading taken *after* the fires were extinguished cannot tell us what the temperature or pressure inside the car was *during* the multi-hour fire exposure, thereby undermining the entire premise that the car was \"normal\" throughout the event.",
  "chunk_0-19": "Object for lack of foundation and instruct the witness to state clearly that while they can read what is printed on the page, they have no personal knowledge regarding the accuracy, context, or methodology of the data presented in a report they have not fully reviewed.",
  "chunk_0-20": "Drill down into the system architecture behind the temperature readings: how are they captured, by what specific device, where is the data transmitted, what is the format, and who has access to the raw data versus the final reports?",
  "chunk_0-21": "On redirect, I will have the witness explain the complete operational context for those temperature readings, establishing whether the system's own protocols allow for those temperatures during specific phases like startup or a defrost cycle.",
  "chunk_0-22": "Object to the question's form as leading and containing an absolute, and instruct the witness not to accept the characterization, but to require counsel to specify the exact time and data point they are referring to.",
  "chunk_0-23": "On redirect, establish the specific safety protocols and the physical conditions of the scene\u2014including the intensity of the fires, risk of explosion, and mandatory exclusion zones\u2014that made it impossible and reckless for any personnel to approach the cars to take temperature readings prior to February 5th.",
  "chunk_0-24": "Let's unpack the phrase \"no possible way.\" Detail for me every remote temperature sensing technology, such as aerial thermal imaging, that was considered and specifically why each was determined to be impossible to use.",
  "chunk_0-25": "On redirect, establish the protocol that *was* used to assess the car's condition, focusing on what information was available from other sources or systems and why that was the accepted method for ensuring safety.",
  "chunk_0-26": "On redirect, I will focus on deconstructing the compound question the witness affirmed by asking: \"Let's separate the two parts of that last question. First, what specific document or standard operating procedure dictates the acceptable temperature *range* for loading these cars?\"",
  "chunk_0-27": "Establish the specific protocol for how that measurement is taken and recorded, breaking down the physical act into who performs it, what tool they use, and where the data is stored.",
  "chunk_0-28": "Object for lack of foundation and instruct the witness to clarify if they personally took the measurement, observed it being taken, or are simply recalling a number from a document, before answering anything about the value itself.",
  "chunk_0-29": "Establish the official protocol under which the SPSI team operated: who tasked them, what their standard procedure was for recording such a measurement, where the data was officially documented, and who has custody of that record.",
  "chunk_0-30": "Immediately ask the witness to explain the process of runaway polymerization in a VCM tank car being heated by an external fire, establishing that this chemical reaction can begin and become unstoppable even while initial, isolated temperature and pressure readings might still appear \"normal.\"",
  "chunk_0-31": "Establish the specific, objective methodology and standards SRS was instructed to use to define the term \"remarkable\" before addressing their ultimate conclusion.",
  "chunk_0-32": "Advise my client at the next break to continue providing full, contextual answers that describe the system as a whole, just as they began to, and not to let opposing counsel rush them or force them into an oversimplified definition.",
  "chunk_0-33": "Drill down on the term \"welded,\" asking for the specific type of weld used, the engineering specifications that govern it, and the procedures for inspecting its integrity.",
  "chunk_0-34": "On redirect, I will have the witness map out the entire structural system component by component, defining the bolster's precise, limited role to factually dismantle the oversimplified \"foundation\" analogy established by opposing counsel.",
  "chunk_0-35": "Establish the precise mechanical relationship and distinct functions of the \"tank car\" versus the \"trucks\" to prevent opposing counsel from collapsing them into one flawed concept.",
  "chunk_0-36": "Ask the witness to explain the specific risks of a boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion (BLEVE) and why the \"normal\" pressure readings taken at that moment could not guarantee the pressure relief devices would continue to function properly under prolonged fire exposure.",
  "chunk_0-37": "Focus the questioning on a car-by-car analysis, systematically breaking down the specific, observable differences in damage to demonstrate precisely why my opponent's attempt at a generalized characterization is factually unsustainable.",
  "chunk_0-38": "On redirect, I will have the witness define \"least damage\" with granular, physical detail and contrast that state with the car's intended performance specifications to demonstrate that it still represented a catastrophic system failure.",
  "chunk_0-39": "On redirect, ask the witness to define the precise operational meaning of \"stable,\" identify the specific contractors who reached that conclusion, and describe the exact evaluation methodology they used to do so, thereby deconstructing the vague and conclusory statement they just adopted.",
