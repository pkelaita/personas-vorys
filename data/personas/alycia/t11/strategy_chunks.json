  "Q.   Each of us are going to ask you\nsome questions. This is my turn to ask\nbecause it's our notice, so I go first.",
  "But I'm going to be, what might\nseem to you, very specifically interested in\none particular car in the train derailment,\nwhich I'm going to call the Trinity car.\nO k a y ?\nA.   (Witness nods head.)\nQ.   You need to say -- you need to\nanswer audibly.\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   Are you familiar with which of\nthe cars we're talking about?\nA.

And they tried to put together 16 a comprehensive document that recorded what 17 each person observed or did on the days of 18 the derailment or in managing the derailment. 19 MS. PETTY: Objection. 20 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 21 QUESTIONS BY MR. BRENZA: 22 Q. Right? 23 A. Yes. 24 Q. All right. Let me -- I'm going 25 to focus you a little more now on who I am.|Page 17 1 farthest east in the derailment. 2 Q. Okay. That's correct. 3 And so the vinyl chloride cars 4 were something called tank cars. 5 R ig h t ? 6 A. Yes. 7 Q. They were 105J DOT-specified 8 tank cars. 9 R ig h t ? 10 A. Yeah, DOT 105J300Ws. 11 Q.

  "Q.   And they still didn't release\ntheir contents.\nRight?\nMS. PETTY: Objection.\nMR. FUKUMURA: Objection.\nTHE WITNESS: No, that's not\ncorrect.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. BRENZA:",
  "Q.   Well, I know you're going to\nsay that they released them through the\npressure relief device.\nRight?\nA.   That's correct.\nQ.   Other than through the pressure\nrelease device -- and we'll talk about that a\nlittle more in a minute. Other than through\nthe pressure release device, none of those\ncars released any of their contents until\nNorfolk Southern blew them up.",
  "Right?\nMS. PETTY: Objection.\nPage 19 1 R ig h t ? 2 MS. PETTY: Objection. 3 THE WITNESS: Yes, it has head 4 shields or head protection. 5 QUESTIONS BY MR. BRENZA: 6 Q. And in this case, this 7 particular derailment, all of those safety 8 aspects of those cars, the tank cars, the VC 9 tank cars, functioned as they were expected 10 to function. 11 R ig h t ? 12 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 13 MS. PETTY: Objection. 14 THE WITNESS: The tank car 15 didn't puncture, correct. 16 QUESTIONS BY MR. BRENZA: 17 Q. It didn't puncture. It didn't 18 release any of its material in an 19 uncontrolled way. 20 R ig h t ? 21 MS. PETTY: Objection. 22 THE WITNESS: Correct. 23 QUESTIONS BY MR. BRENZA: 24 Q. And some of those cars were 25 sitting in fire for a day or more.|Page 21 1 MR.

BRENZA: 8 Q. The pressure relief device, the 9 PRD, as you say, that is a -- yet another 10 safety device on these cars. 11 R ig h t ? 12 MS. PETTY: Objection. 13 THE WITNESS: Yes. 14 QUESTIONS BY MR. BRENZA: 15 Q. And the purpose of the pressure 16 release -- relief device is to allow a small 17 amount of contents to escape the car, to 18 reduce the pressure inside the car if it's 19 getting too high. 20 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 21 QUESTIONS BY MR. BRENZA: 22 Q. Right? 23 MS. PETTY: Objection. 24 THE WITNESS: It is designed to 25 release excess pressure, yes.|",
  "QUESTIONS BY MR. BRENZA:\nQ.   So by releasing material, the\npressure relief devices were functioning as\nthey were supposed to function.\nR i g h t ?\nMS. PETTY: Objection.\nMR.

  "Q.   Okay. Now, let me get back to\nthe Trinity car.\nThe Trinity car was one of\nthese DOT 105J300W cars.\nRight?\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   Tank cars.\nOnes with armor and insulation\nand pressure relief valves.\nRight?\nMS. PETTY: Objection.\nTHE WITNESS: Yes.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. BRENZA:\nQ.   And the Trinity car -- do you\nQUESTIONS BY MR. BRENZA:\nQ.   And did you -- did you\nphysically inspect the Trinity car?\nA.   I did not physically inspect\nit.\nQ.   Jon Simpson did.\nRight?\nA.   Among others.\nQ.   Among others?\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   And the Trinity car has\nsomething called an angle valve on it.\nRight?",
  "A.   All of the vinyl chloride cars\nhave angle valves on them.\nQ.   The Trinity car's angle valve",
  "was functioning properly, even after the\nderailment.\nRight?\nMS. PETTY: Objection.\nMR. FUKUMURA: Objection.\nTHE WITNESS: The angle -- the\nvapor angle valve for sure was because\nthey were able to put a pressure gauge\non it.\nPage 23 1 recognize these cars by their numbers? 2 A. Yes. They're reporting marks. 3 That's how they're identified. 4 Q. Okay. So the Trinity car is 5 TILX402025. 6 Do you recognize it by that 7 number? 8 A. That sounds right. 9 Q. Okay. And it was, depending on 10 how you count, Car 26 or Car 28 in the train. 11 Right? 12 A. I believe that's correct. 13 Q. Okay. And as you said, it 14 was -- it was on the eastern-most side of the 15 derailment? 16 A. That's correct. 17 Q. Okay. The Trinity car did not 18 release any of its contents other than 19 through its pressure relief valve, as it was 20 intended to do so. 21 Right? 22 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 23 MS. PETTY: Objection. 24 THE WITNESS: That's correct. 25|Page 25 1 QUESTIONS BY MR. BRENZA: 2 Q. And you just said something 3 about the vapor angle valve. 4 Is that different from what I 5 said, just the angle valve, or is it the same 6 thing? 7 I just want to make sure we're 8 talking about the same thing. 9 A. They're all the same type of 10 valves, but there are vapor valves and there 11 are liquid valves. 12 Q. Okay. And so we're talking 13 about the vapor angle valve, so that's how 14 I'll refer to it now. 15 Is the vapor angle valve of the 16 Trinity car the valve that was used by the 17 shipper to load the car? 18 MS. BROZ: Objection. Form. 19 THE WITNESS: I'm not sure. In 20 general purposes, when they load a 21 car, they have to use at least one 22 liquid line and the vapor line, but 23 I'm not sure how the -- how they 24 loaded the car. 25|\nQUESTIONS BY MR. BRENZA:\nQ.   Okay. So in this case you\ndon't know specifically how that car was\nloaded?\nA.   Correct.\nQ.   But the angle valve was -- on\nthe Trinity car was still functioning, even\nafter the car had been in a derailment.\nRight?\nA.   That vapor valve was still\noperational, yes.\nQ.   And Jon Simpson and others that",
  "were working with him were able to measure\nthe car's temperature and pressure by using\nthat angle valve.\nRight?\nMS. PETTY: Objection.\nTHE WITNESS: No.\nThey could get a pressure.\nThey couldn't get the temperature.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. BRENZA:",
  "Q.   Okay. Well, there's a\nrelationship between pressure and\ntemperature.\nIsn't there?\nQUESTIONS BY MR. BRENZA:",
  "Q.   Trinity's car, because it had",
  "been off to the side more than the other\ncars, had not been in any what's called pool\nfire in the course of the East Palestine\nderailment.\nRight?\nMS. PETTY: Objection.\nTHE WITNESS: It had fire\ndamage. I couldn't say it was in a\npool fire.",
  "QUESTIONS BY MR. BRENZA:\nQ.   And let's just, you know,\nclarify what a pool fire is.\nIs a pool fire a pool of some\nmaterial from a different car that collects\non the ground and then catches on fire?\nMS. PETTY: Objection.\nTHE WITNESS: It is a pool of\nburning liquid on the ground, yes.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. BRENZA:",
  "Q.   Okay. And some of the cars\nwere in pool fires for extended periods of\ntime, over a day.\nRight?\nPage 27 1 A. Yes. 2 Q. In this case, though, they took 3 a pressure temperature -- I'm sorry, a 4 pressure measurement. 5 Isn't it correct that the 6 pressure measurement they took showed that 7 the pressure inside the Trinity car was 8 normal, just a normal pressure? 9 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 10 MS. PETTY: Objection. 11 THE WITNESS: It was 60 PSI. 12 QUESTIONS BY MR. BRENZA: 13 Q. And you know that from the NTSB 14 report that the cars are loaded around 15 60 PSI. 16 Right? 17 MS. PETTY: Objection. 18 THE WITNESS: Yes. 19 QUESTIONS BY MR. BRENZA: 20 Q. That's how they leave the 21 shipper's facility. 22 Right? 23 MS. PETTY: Objection. 24 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 25 THE WITNESS: Yes.|Page 29 1 A. Yes, for several hours. 2 Q. But Trinity's car was not. 3 Right? 4 A. It was exposed to fire. It had 5 fire damage to it. 6 Q. Okay. It had fire damage 7 because it was near other cars that were 8 having pool fires and other problems. 9 Right? 10 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 11 MS. BROZ: Objection. Form. 12 THE WITNESS: Yes. 13 QUESTIONS BY MR. BRENZA: 14 Q. But the -- but the Trinity car 15 temperature, at all times that it was 16 measured during the derailment and after, was 17 normal. 18 Right? 19 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 20 MS. PETTY: Objection. 21 THE WITNESS: No. We got a 22 pressure on the car of the 60 PSI 23 after the fires were died down. There 24 was no temperature checks on the cars 25 while the active fires were going.|\nWood 30(b)(6) Exhibit 1 marked\nfor identification.)\nQUESTIONS BY MR. BRENZA:\nQ.   Well, all right. I'm going to\nhand you what I'm marking as Exhibit 1. This\nis the NTSB report.

So the only way 20 they could have moved the car was to 21 dig under and wrap their cable around 22 the barrel of the tank and drag it. 23 And our mechanical personnel 24 wouldn't allow that, and our HAZMAT 25 personnel.

There was three 13 Hulcher personnel doing the walkaround, but I 14 don't know them by name. 15 Q. Did Geoff Craker make that 16 decision entirely on his own, or did he have 17 a chain of command that he had to clear it 18 with? 19 A.

  "The reason you -- the reason\nNorfolk Southern didn't attempt to unload the\nTrinity car through its liquid valve was that\nit was too close to other cars in the -- in\nthe wreck that were deemed to be not stable.\nPage 55 1 A. That was the only other option 2 brought to -- that the Hulcher said they 3 could to move the tank. That was the only 4 way they had. 5 Q. Did anyone discuss unloading 6 the Trinity car? 7 A. That would have been the 8 ultimate idea to do, to move the car, to get 9 it out of harm's way, was to unload it. 10 Q. Okay. But we discussed earlier 11 the vapor angle valve of the Trinity car was 12 functional. 13 Right? 14 A. The vapor valve was, but you 15 can't unload through a vapor valve. 16 Q. Why do you say that? 17 A. Because there's no liquid 18 against the bottom of the vapor valve. It's 19 in the vapor space of the car. You have to 20 unload out of a liquid line. 21 Q.

That's correct. 3 Q. Cars that were on fire or had 4 suffered more damage? 5 A. That's correct. 6 Q. All right.

What are the roles of -- 11 I'm going to ask you about some of the 12 contractors that were involved in assisting 13 Norfolk Southern deal with the derailment. 14 The first one, SPSI, what was 15 their involvement? 16 A. SPSI would have been -- they 17 were the first contractor contacted. They're 18 based out of Washington, PA, so they were -- 19 they were even the closest at the time. 20 But this incident came in as a 21 derailment with fire. They also house our 22 firefighting equipment, and they're -- they 23 have an industrial firefighting brigade. 24 They are a high-hazard contractor for a 25 myriad of -- they're well-known across the|\nrail industry and chemical industry.\nAnd then ultimately when we\nfind vinyl chloride was there, they would\nhave been there anyway because they're one -5 they're a CHLOREP contractor.\nQ.   Does SPSI assist Norfolk\nSouthern in responding to train derailments?\nA.   Yes. Among other contractors,\ny e s .\nQ.

Is that another company that 4 specializes in dealing with train 5 derailments? 6 A. They are known in -- with the 7 railroads for train derailment.

It was one of the 4 possibilities. 5 Q. Was that for all five vinyl 6 chloride railcars? 7 A. Four, mainly, but we couldn't 8 rule out the possibility in any of them. 9 Q. So it's Norfolk Southern's 10 testimony that at least four of the five 11 vinyl chloride railcars' pressure relief 12 devices stopped activating properly when the 13 fires were snuffed out? 14 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 15 MS. PETTY: Objection. 16 THE WITNESS: No. We believed 17 polymerization was going on that was 18 clogging up the PRDs that made the 19 lazy fires go out.

When it went off, there 10 was a loud banging sound. 11 Q. And you believe that loud 12 banging sound came from the PRD? 13 A. We didn't know. It -- but it 14 coincided with the activation of that PRD. 15 Q. So setting aside the TILX car, 16 Norfolk Southern believed that it was 17 possible that the four PRDs were not 18 activating properly because polymerization 19 was gumming up the PRD themselves? 20 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 21 THE WITNESS: That's what we 22 believed. 23 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 24 Q.

No. 3 Q. Okay. How about after 4 February 6, 2023? What evidence does Norfolk 5 Southern have that the PRDs in the four vinyl 6 chloride railcars were not operating 7 properly? 8 A. Well, even from the NTSB 9 report, there was damage to O-rings, again, 10 what we would expect in fire situations. 11 There was a PRD that was jammed 12 that they never could get to activate up 13 to -- they raised the pressure to 275 PSI, 14 and the valve still wouldn't open.

  "it would have been with regards to\npolymerization.\nQUESTIONS BY MS. COLLIER:",
  "Q.   But -- and -- but you, NS, are\nnot aware of exactly what information was\nconveyed?\nMS. PETTY: Objection.\nTHE WITNESS: No, I am not.\nMS. COLLIER: Mr. Wood, I\nbelieve that's it for me. Thank you\nfor your time.\nPage 127 1 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 2 THE WITNESS: I believe it 3 probably was at the local, with 4 whoever from NS they might have been 5 dealing with, Scott Gould or Scott 6 Deutsch. 7 QUESTIONS BY MS. COLLIER: 8 Q. What information did Bob Gold 9 provide to SPSI or SRS? 10 A. I'm not sure. 11 Q. You, as a corporate 12 representative of Norfolk Southern, are not 13 sure what information Bob Gold would have 14 conveyed regarding these five VCM cars? 15 MS. PETTY: Objection. 16 THE WITNESS: I am not. 17 QUESTIONS BY MS. COLLIER: 18 Q. Okay. What about Pat Student? 19 Same question, did NS consult with a Pat 20 Student regarding the five VCM tank cars? 21 A. I believe the same applies. I 22 mean, I know who Pat Student is. 23 Q. Pat Student -- well, who is Pat 24 Student? 25 A. He's a former HAZMAT officer|Page 129 1 THE WITNESS: Okay. 2 VIDEOGRAPHER: We are now going 3 off the video record. The time is 4 currently 11:38 a.m. 5 (Off the record at 11:38 a.m.) 6 VIDEOGRAPHER: We are now back 7 on the video record. The time is 8 currently 11:39 a.m. 9 REDIRECT EXAMINATION 10 QUESTIONS BY MR. BRENZA: 11 Q. Mr. Wood, would you pull out 12 Exhibit 1 again? It's the NTSB -- 13 A. Yes. 14 Q. -- Hazardous Materials Group 15 factual report. 16 A. Yes. 17 Q. And turn to page 94, please. 18 Are you there? 19 A. Yes. 20 Q. Now, you were asked some 21 questions about the role that SPSI and SRS 22 played by other counsel. I want to just 23 follow up a little bit on that. 24 Do you see at the top of 25 page 94 of Exhibit 1 there's a discussion|\nbeginning in the second sentence with the",
  "words \"the IC\"?\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   And IC stands for incident\ncommand.\nRight?\nA.   Yes. Or incident commander.",
  "Q.   The sentence says, \"The IC told\nNTSB investigators that none of those present\nat this meeting objected to conducting the",
  "vent and burn based on the information that\nwas presented and the perceived BLEVE hazard\nidentified by Norfolk Southern, SPSI and\nSRS.\"\nDo you see that?\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   Is that accurate, to your",
  "understanding?\nA.   I wouldn't have referred to it\nas a BLEVE. I would have called it a\ncatastrophic tank car failure, but, yes,\nthat's correct.\nQ.   But the -- but the meeting",
  "that's being described is one where Norfolk\nSouthern and SPSI and SRS are presenting\nQUESTIONS BY MR. BRENZA:\nQ.   Okay. And it was a choice.\nRight?\nMS. PETTY: Objection.\nTHE WITNESS: Yes.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. BRENZA:\nQ.   If you look at the next",
  "sentence, it says, \"These discussions also\nrevolved around the need to vent and burn all\nfive vinyl chloride tank cars as opposed to\njust one or two.\"\nDo you see that?\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   Do you recall that there was a",
  "time in the management of the East Palestine\nderailment when the plan was only to vent and\nburn one or two of the vinyl tank cars?",
  "MS. PETTY: Objection.\nTHE WITNESS: There were\ndiscussions about how many cars needed\nto be vent and burned. We were",
  "originally going to move the TILX car.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. BRENZA:\nQ.   The Trinity car?\nA.   The Trinity car.\nPage 131 1 information to the incident commander about 2 what they perceive to be the existing risks 3 and the need for the vent and burn operation? 4 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 5 MS. PETTY: Objection. 6 THE WITNESS: That's correct. 7 QUESTIONS BY MR. BRENZA: 8 Q. And the vent and burn 9 operation, just to be clear, is -- was a 10 procedure where explosives were intentionally 11 affixed to the vinyl chloride cars and the 12 vinyl chloride cars were detonated. 13 Right? 14 A. That's not exactly the case. 15 There are shape charges put at specific 16 points on the car, vapor space and liquid 17 phase, to facilitate a controlled burn of the 18 product. 19 Q. Okay. But it's an intentional 20 choice that Norfolk Southern and the incident 21 command made to destroy these cars in a 22 controlled way? 23 MS. PETTY: Objection. 24 THE WITNESS: It was the 25 decision of unified command, yes.|Page 133 1 The ultimate decision come down 2 after consultation with all of the ER 3 contractors. And specific to the demolition 4 folks and the proximities of the cars -- 5 Q. Okay. 6 A. -- required that they all be 7 done. 8 Q. So one of the cars that 9 originally was not going to be part of the 10 vent and burn was the Trinity car. 11 Right? 12 A. That's correct. 13 Q. And then if you look at the 14 sentence reading further into the paragraph, 15 it says, \"SPSI and SRS argued that a safety 16 concern could ensue over the effects venting 17 and burning fewer tank cars might have on the 18 remaining tank cars.\" 19 Do you see that? 20 A. Yes. 21 Q. Is that accurate, again, to 22 your recollection? 23 A. Yes. They worried about the 24 effects of the proximity and the radiant heat 25 generated from the other cars causing worse|\nproblems -- causing more damage to the other\ncars.\nQ.   And one of the cars they were",
  "concerned about that would receive this sort\nof collateral damage was the Trinity car.\nRight?\nA.   That's correct.\nMS. PETTY: Objection.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. BRENZA:",
  "Q.   And so instead of allowing\nfewer cars to be vented and burned, they\ndecided to vent and burn the Trinity car as\nwell because it would have been damaged by\nthe venting and burning fewer than all of\nthem?",
  "MS. PETTY: Objection.\nTHE WITNESS: It was a safety\nconcern that -- the feeling was if\nthey didn't do all five, they could\nset off a chain reaction in the cars\nthey didn't vent and burn that might\nre -- might lead to an uncontrolled\nrelease as opposed to a controlled\nrelease.\nWood 30(b)(6) Exhibit 9 marked\nWhat I want to ask you -- what\nI want to ask you doesn't have to do with\nexactly who Amy Miles is, so you should be\nable to still answer these questions.\nDo you see that on the\nsecond -- well, the page ending in 394, at\nAlan Shaw writes a text that says,\nAnother view of the wreck. These are the\ncars we blew.\"\nDo you see that?\nA.   I see that.",
  "Q.   And then Amy Miles responded,\nGreat. They held up long enough for us to\ntake controlled action.\"\nRight? Do you see that?\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   And then Alan Shaw, if you go\nto the very bottom of the page, he says, \"We\nexpected\" -- \"We expect to have the track\nback in service by 11 a.m. tomorrow.\"\nDo you see that?\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   And then if you go to the next",
  "page, he says, \"That beats my initial\nestimate by about 36 hours.\"\nPage 135 1 for identification.) 2 QUESTIONS BY MR. BRENZA: 3 Q. I'm going to hand you what I'm 4 going to mark as -- what are we up to, 5 Exhibit 9? 6 Exhibit 9 is a printout of a 7 set of text communications between Alan Shaw 8 and Amy Miles dated, looks like, February 6th 9 of 2023. 10 Do you see that? 11 A. Uh-huh, yes. 12 Q. And February 6, 2023, was the 13 day of the vent and burn. 14 Right? 15 A. That's correct. 16 Q. And Alan Shaw is the CEO of 17 Norfolk Southern. 18 Right? 19 A. That's correct. 20 Q. Who is Amy Miles, if you know? 21 A. I'm not sure. I'm going to 22 have to see by the text content. 23 I apologize, but I'm not sure 24 who Amy Miles is. 25 Q. Okay. Very well.|Page 137 1 Do you see that? 2 A. Yes. 3 Q. And whoever Amy Miles is, she 4 says, \"Great news. Congrats. Kudos to the 5 team.\" 6 Do you see that? 7 A. Yes. 8 Q. Is it true that by venting and 9 burning all five vinyl tank cars, Norfolk 10 Southern was able to reopen its rail line 11 sooner than it originally had expected it 12 would have to wait? 13 MS. PETTY: Objection. 14 MR. FUKUMURA: Objection. 15 MS. PETTY: Outside the scope. 16 THE WITNESS: The vent and burn 17 brought a safe end to problems we 18 thought existed at the site, but there 19 was still other work to be done. 20 QUESTIONS BY MR. BRENZA: 21 Q. And my question was, did the 22 vent and burn of all five tank cars allow the 23 train rails to reopen earlier than Norfolk 24 Southern originally thought they would have 25 to wait?|\nMS. PETTY: Objection.\nMR. FUKUMURA: Objection.\nMS. PETTY: Outside the scope\nof the noticed topics.\nTHE WITNESS: That's\nprobably -- probably true. It's\nreally not sure, until you actually\nget in and start wrecking, how long\nit's going to take to clear a site and\nrebuild track, aside from the vent and\nburn.\nSo my guess would be yes, but I\ncouldn't say that positively.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. BRENZA:"
