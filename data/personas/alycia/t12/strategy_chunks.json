Yes.",
  "Q.   So I'm going to use SRS\nthroughout the remainder of the day.\nOkay?\nA.   I want you to use the whole\nthing.\nQ.   That'll be too much for me.\nI'm sorry.\nBut we can agree SRS means\nSpecialized Response Solutions.\nRight?\nA.   Yes, sir.\nQ.   Okay. Am I correct that you\nhave a bachelor's of science in occupational\nhealth and safety?\nA.   Yes, sir.\nQ.   And from what institution did\nyou receive that degree?\nA.   Columbia Southern University.\nQ.   In what year?\nA.   2015? '16? One of those two.\nQ.   And as part of obtaining that\ndegree in occupational health and safety,",
  "what, if any, courses in chemistry did you\ntake?",
  "Q.   Okay. I'm just talking about\nlike academies or schools specifically.\nAny others?\nA.   Texas A&M. Illinois State fire\ncollege. There's a lot of them over\nyears.\nQ.   Understood.",
  "Just focusing on the first two\ninstitutions that you mentioned -10    A.   Yes, sir.\nQ.   -- did you receive HAZMAT\ntraining?\nA.   Yes, sir.\nQ.   And as part of that HAZMAT\ntraining, did you receive education in\nchemistry?\nA.   It was discussed. It was -18 there were classes about chemistry, yes.\nQ.   Those chemistry classes, did\nthey include specific instruction on vinyl\nchloride monomer?\nA.   In the fire classes, no.\nQ.   I'm going to be using the\nphrase, as I'm sure you can guess, \"vinyl\nchloride monomer\" a lot today.\nPage 11 1 A. I didn't take any chemistry 2 classes in that class. 3 Q. Okay. So no chemistry classes 4 while at -- was it Columbia? 5 A. Southern. 6 Q. Columbia Southern. 7 C o r r e c t ? 8 A. Yes, sir. 9 Q. You also attended at some point 10 in your career firefighter academy. 11 Correct? 12 A. Several, yes, sir. 13 Q. Okay. What was the first 14 firefighter academy that you attended? 15 A. Tarrant County Junior College, 16 right after I graduated in 1981. 17 Q. Okay. And thereafter, what's 18 the next firefighter academy you had? 19 A. City of Arlington fire 20 department recruit class of 1983. 21 Q. Okay. Other than those two 22 academies, were there additional firefighting 23 academies? 24 A. There's a lot of firefighting 25 classes, yes, sir.|Page 13 1 A. Yes. 2 Q. Can we agree that that's 3 abbreviated to VCM? 4 A. VCM, yes, sir. 5 Q. Okay. Other than the bachelor 6 of science that we discussed, do you have any 7 other formal, post-high school education? 8 A. No, sir. 9 Q. Other than what we've 10 discussed, do you have any other formal 11 education in chemistry? 12 A. No, sir. 13 Q. Other than what we've 14 discussed, do you have any formal instruction 15 in chemistry? 16 A. No, sir. 17 Q. You do not consider yourself to 18 be a chemist. 19 C o r r e c t ? 20 A. That is correct. 21 Q. You do not consider yourself to 22 be a chemical engineer. 23 C o r r e c t ? 24 A. That is correct. 25 Q. And you don't consider yourself|\nto be a material scientist.\nR i g h t ?",
  "A.   That is correct.",
  "Q.   So you would agree with me that",
  "you are not an expert in VCM.\nCorrect?",
  "MR. LEVINE: Objection.\nTHE WITNESS: I have a lot of\nexperience dealing with vinyl chloride\nin containers and in plants and in\ntransportation.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. GOMEZ:\nQ.   Let me ask the question a\nlittle differently.",

  "not an expert in the chemical properties of",
  "VCM.\nC o r r e c t ?\nA.   Correct.",
  "Q.   You'd agree with me that you're",
  "not an expert in the reactivity of VCM?\nA.   That's correct.",
  "Q.   You'd agree with me that you're",
  "not an expert in the polymerization of VCM?\nA.   That's correct.\nBut I think 1997 sounds about\nwhen you started firefighter academy.\nIs that right?\nA.   No, sir.\nQ.   When was that again?\nA.   1981.",
  "MR. LEVINE: Can we take one\nbreak? I realized I'm not mic'ed up\nto be able to make my objections.\nVIDEOGRAPHER: Stand by. The\ntime is 9:09 a.m. we're going off the\nrecord.\nOff the record at 9:09 a.m.)\nVIDEOGRAPHER: The time is\na.m., and we're back on the\nrecord.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. GOMEZ:\nQ.   Mr. Day, before we took a quick\nbreak, you corrected me that your firefighter\ntraining began in 1981.\nA.   My firefighter training began\nin actually -- probably in the '70s.\nQ.   Okay.\nA.   But I graduated in '81 and went\nto recruit class at TCJC.\nPage 15 1 Q. You mentioned a number of 2 schools beyond the two -- and forgive me, 3 I've forgotten them already -- that you've 4 attended for firefighting and HAZMAT 5 training. 6 Right? 7 A. Yes, sir. 8 Q. And I believe you actually 9 produced in response to a subpoena a large 10 number of certificates and other 11 documentation reflecting that you've done 12 training at these establishments. 13 Do you recall producing those? 14 A. Yes, sir. 15 Q. I think there were over 200 16 different certificates. I'm just going to 17 call them certificates. 18 Does that sound about right? 19 A. Yes, sir. 20 Q. And those spanned, if I recall 21 correctly, from 1997 up through pretty much 22 the present. 23 A. I don't remember when they 24 started. I had a lot of certificates. 25 Q. Fair enough.|Page 17 1 Q. Okay. Understood. 2 From 1981 to the present, 3 you've attended a number of continuing 4 education and refresher courses in 5 firefighting. 6 Right? 7 A. Yes, sir. 8 Q. And some of those classes also 9 entailed HAZMAT. 10 Right? 11 A. Most classes did, yes, sir. 12 Q. Some of the institutions that 13 provided those refreshers and training 14 include OSHA. 15 Right? 16 A. Yes, sir. 17 Q. Another one is CHLOREP. 18 Is that correct? 19 A. Yes, sir. 20 Q. What does CHLOREP stand for? 21 A. It's the -- it's a division of 22 The Chlorine Institute. It's the -- a trade 23 organization for chlorine manufacturers, and 24 they cover all things that -- mission 25 chemicals of chlorine production.|",
  "Q.   Is SRS a member of CHLOREP?\nA.   We're an associate member.\nQ.   And just briefly, what's an\nassociate member?\nA.   We're not a voting member, but",
  "we attend training. We attend conferences\nand such.\nQ.   So you participate in CHLOREP\ntrainings and meetings, things of that\nnature?\nA.   Yes, sir.\nQ.   You also attended refreshers",
  "and education that was put on by a group with\nthe abbreviation is SERTC.\nIs that correct?\nA.   Yes, sir.\nQ.   And what does SERTC stand for?\nA.   SERTC is the -- basically it's\nthe old Transportation Technology Center at\nPueblo, Colorado, that teaches emergency\nresponse for rail and highway accidents and\nincidents.",
  "Q.   Is that sometimes in shorthand\nreferred to as \"going out to Pueblo\" or\ntraining in Pueblo\"?\nA.   The classes that we put on are\nnot -- don't focus solely on polymerization\nof VCM. It's more of how to deal with\ncompressed flammable gases in emergency\nresponse situations.",
  "Q.   Do you recall from any of the\ntrainings and refreshers during that period,",
  "to the present, any of them providing\nspecific instruction on the polymerization of\nVCM?\nA.   Yes, sir.",
  "MR. BRAGA: Object to the form",
  "of the question.",
  "QUESTIONS BY MR. GOMEZ:",
  "Q.   Which trainings are those or",
  "were those?",
  "A.   A lot of the classes briefly\ntouch on polymerization of VCM and other\npolymer material.",
  "Q.   And you said that they briefly\ntouch upon it.",
  "What kind of areas do they\ncover with respect to VCM polymerization?\nA.   What happens to inhibitors when\nexposed to elevated heat, high pressure and\nPage 19 1 A. Pueblo, yes, sir. 2 Q. Okay. I also saw in some of 3 those certificates and other documents 4 references to tank car specialist. 5 Are you familiar with that 6 phrase? 7 A. Yes, sir. 8 Q. Can you just describe for me 9 what that means? 10 A. Basically it's somebody that 11 knows containers, that knows the construction 12 of them and how to handle them when they're 13 involved in incidents and accidents and have 14 leaks. 15 Q. And you've since -- certainly 16 since 1981 have attended a number of 17 refreshers and continuing education specific 18 to tank cars. 19 Correct? 20 A. Yes, sir. 21 Q. Throughout that period, let's 22 say from 1981 to the present, which of these 23 various trainings and refreshers do you 24 recall providing specific instruction on 25 vinyl chloride monomer polymerization?|Page 21 1 such. 2 Q. Okay. And when you're 3 referencing inhibitors, that's in connection 4 with the transportation of stabilized VCM in 5 a railcar, for example. 6 Right? 7 A. All materials, yes, sir. 8 Q. And again, you mentioned 9 inhibitors. That's a method for stabilizing 10 VCM for transportation. 11 Right? 12 A. That is correct. 13 Q. Oxygen purging is another way 14 of stabilizing VCM for transportation. 15 Correct? 16 A. That is correct. 17 Q. Those are distinct methods for 18 stabilizing VCM for transportation. 19 Correct? 20 A. That's correct. 21 Q. Would you agree with me, based 22 off of your training, that both of those 23 methods neutralize the initiators needed to 24 start the polymerization reaction in VCM? 25 MR. BRAGA: Objection to the|",
  "form of the question.",
  "MR. LEVINE: And same\nobjection.\nTHE WITNESS: Yes, sir.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. GOMEZ:\nQ.   An inhibitor is actually added\nto the VCM to stop the reaction from\noccurring.\nRight?",
  "A.   Stabilizes the materials, yes,\nsir.",
  "Q.   And an inhibitor can include a\nvariety of chemicals. One of them, I think,\nis phenol?\nA.   Yes, sir.",
  "Q.   Whereas oxygen purging removes\noxygen from the vessel so that there is not a",
  "catalyst or initiator for the VCM to start\npolymerizing.",
  "Right?\nMR. LEVINE: Objection.\nMR. BRAGA: Same objection.\nTHE WITNESS: Yes, sir.\nMR. GOMEZ: Just before we go\nany further, in past depositions we've\nMR. BRAGA: Object.\nTHE WITNESS: Yes, sir.",
  "QUESTIONS BY MR. GOMEZ:\nQ.   That's not the case when there\nis stabilization of VCM via oxygen purging.\nRight?",
  "MR. LEVINE: Objection.\nTHE WITNESS: It can be, yes,\nsir.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. GOMEZ:",
  "Q.   How can it be?\nMR. LEVINE: Same objection.",
  "THE WITNESS: Anytime that you\nstabilize something, inhibit\nsomething, elevated heat and extreme\npressure can change things at a",
  "molecular level.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. GOMEZ:\nQ.   So is it your understanding\nthat when we're talking about oxygen purged,\nstabilization for VCM, the application of\nheat changes something within the vessel that\ndetracts from the ability to stop the\npolymerization reaction?",
  "A.   It has the ability, it's my",
  "Page 23 1 agreed that one objection is an 2 objection for all. 3 MR. BRAGA: Okay. 4 MR. GOMEZ: I'm happy to agree 5 to that as well. 6 MR. LEVINE: Let's do that. 7 QUESTIONS BY MR. GOMEZ: 8 Q. You mentioned in connection 9 with inhibitors that you received training, I 10 think, specifically about how heat interacts 11 with those inhibitors? 12 A. Yes, sir. 13 Q. Do I remember that correctly? 14 A. Yes, sir. 15 Q. When VCM is -- when stabilized 16 VCM is shipped with an inhibitor, is it your 17 understanding that heating can lead to the 18 loss of the inhibitor? 19 A. Yes, sir. 20 Q. And correct me if I'm wrong, 21 it's not well-understood exactly how those 22 inhibitors get lost, but experience shows 23 that when there's heating and VCM, the 24 inhibitors tend to go away over time. 25 Right?|Page 25 1 understanding, yes, sir. 2 Q. And which of your trainings or 3 educations or refreshers from 1981 4 specifically gave you that information with 5 respect to oxygen stabilized VCM? 6 MR. BRAGA: Object to the form 7 of the question. 8 THE WITNESS: There's -- there 9 was a lot of training between 1981 and 10 the present, and I can't specifically 11 tell you which class said that. But 12 basically in emergency response, 13 stabilized mat -- we have a book of 14 experience that tells us we need to -- 15 that we need to deal with certain 16 materials certain ways. 17 And VCM is a stabilized 18 product, and you have the ability to 19 generate polymer during that -- during 20 heating, elevated heating. 21 QUESTIONS BY MR. GOMEZ: 22 Q. So I appreciate that, but my 23 question is specific to trainings that you 24 recall about the polymerization of 25 oxygen-stabilized VCM and the loss of|\ninhibiting properties.\nDo you recall any specific\ntrainings from 1981 to the present that\ndiscussed that topic?\nA.   No, sir.\nQ.   From 1981 to the present, do\nyou remember any instructors who provided\ninformation or education or training about\nthe loss of inhibitors in oxygen-stabilized\nVCM?\nA.   No, sir.\nMR. BRAGA: Object to the form\nof the question.",
  "But go ahead, you can answer.\nTHE WITNESS: No, sir.",
  "QUESTIONS BY MR. GOMEZ:\nQ.   You mentioned a book of\nexperience. I take it that's not a literal\nbook of experiences.\nRight?\nA.   That's correct.\nQ.   It's the collective memory and\nexperience of those in the HAZMAT industry.\nFair?\nA.   That's correct.",
  "stopping the reaction.\nCorrect?",
  "MR. LEVINE: Objection.\nTHE WITNESS: Yes, sir.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. GOMEZ:",
  "Q.   And you'd agree with me that\nit's important to understand which way VCM is\nbeing stabilized when dealing with a HAZMAT\nsituation involving that chemical.\nCorrect?\nMR. BRAGA: Object to the form",
  "of the question.\nTHE WITNESS: Yes, sir.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. GOMEZ:\nQ.   In your experience in the field",
  "responding to HAZMAT situations, can you\ndescribe for me the instances where you",
  "personally have dealt with a derailed railcar\ncontaining VCM?",
  "A.   I have dozens of incidents\ninvolving vinyl chloride.\nQ.   Okay.\nA.   So you have to be specific on",
  "what -- which one you want.\nQ.   Fair enough.",
  "Page 27 1 Q. And based off of that 2 collective experience, various instructors 3 provide information and insight at, among 4 other things, these trainings that we're 5 talking about. 6 Right? 7 A. Yes, sir. 8 Q. Do you recall any discussion 9 from any trainings from 1981 to the present 10 about specific experiences involving the 11 polymerization of oxygen-stabilized VCM? 12 A. Can you restate the question? 13 Q. Sure. 14 From 1981 to the present, do 15 you recall any of the trainings or refresher 16 courses discussing real-life experiences 17 where oxygen-stabilized VCM polymerized? 18 MR. LEVINE: Objection. 19 THE WITNESS: The training 20 classes, we don't break down VCM into 21 oxygen-stabilized or inhibited VCM. 22 We deal with it as all stabilized VCM. 23 QUESTIONS BY MR. GOMEZ: 24 Q. But you agree with me that 25 those are chemically different ways of|Page 29 1 Let's start with the number. 2 You said dozens. 3 Would you say more or less than 4 50? 5 A. Less than 50. 6 Q. More or less than 25? 7 A. Probably more. 8 Q. So somewhere between 25 and 50. 9 Fair? 10 A. Sure. 11 Q. Of those 25 to 50 situations 12 involving derailed VCM cars, how many of 13 those presented a concern for polymerization 14 of VCM? 15 A. It's always a concern because 16 it is a stabilizer-inhibited product, so 17 there's always a heightened level of concern 18 when we're dealing with vinyl chloride. 19 Q. Let me ask the question 20 differently. 21 Of those 25 to 50 incidents 22 involving VCM, how many of those -- in how 23 many of those was the polymerization and 24 potential explosion of the VCM-containing 25 vessel the primary concern?|",

And in that process, one of the 21 first things that they do is they take in the 22 railcar and they take an oxygen reading. 23 Right? 24 A. Yes, sir. 25 Q. And specifically they're|Page 33 1 Q. And they then check it again 2 for oxygen concentration. 3 Right? 4 MR. LEVINE: Objection. 5 THE WITNESS: Okay. 6 QUESTIONS BY MR. GOMEZ: 7 Q. Have you ever seen a VCM 8 railcar loaded? 9 A. Yes, sir. 10 Q. It's a closed system. 11 Correct? 12 A. That's correct. 13 Q. So if oxygen is purged from the 14 railcar, VCM is then loaded, there's no way 15 for anything to get into the railcar 16 unintentionally, assuming the system stays 17 closed. 18 Right? 19 MR. BRAGA: Object. 20 THE WITNESS: That is correct. 21 QUESTIONS BY MR. GOMEZ: 22 Q. So if they've done it 23 correctly, the end result of this whole 24 closed loading system is that you have 25 99.9 percent pure VCM.|\nRight?\nA.   As long as -3       MR.

And butadiene also can\npolymerize on the application of heat alone.\nPage 35 1 responding to derailments where styrene is a 2 chemical of concern? 3 A. Yes, sir. 4 Q. Styrene is a polymerizable 5 monomer. 6 Right? 7 A. That is correct. 8 Q. Styrene is capable of 9 polymerizing just by the application of heat. 10 Right? 11 MR. BRAGA: Objection. 12 THE WITNESS: It can. 13 QUESTIONS BY MR. GOMEZ: 14 Q. And that's something that you 15 were taught or instructed on in the trainings 16 we discussed earlier? 17 A. Yes, sir. 18 MR. BRAGA: Objection. 19 QUESTIONS BY MR. GOMEZ: 20 Q. Another chemical that I think 21 I've seen mentioned in some of the documents 22 is butadiene? 23 A. Excuse me? 24 Q. Butadiene? 25 A. Butadiene, yes, sir.|Page 37 1 Right? 2 A. That is correct. 3 Q. In fact, butadiene has a 4 relatively low temperature threshold for 5 polymerization. 6 Right? 7 MR. BRAGA: Objection. 8 THE WITNESS: You'll have to 9 clarify what fairly low is. 10 QUESTIONS BY MR. GOMEZ: 11 Q. Sure. 12 Specifically, it can start to 13 polymerize at about 175 degrees Fahrenheit? 14 A. That sounds about right, yes, 15 sir. 16 Q. Now, when we talk about 17 polymerization through your training and the 18 refreshers, you understand that that's a 19 process whereby the bonds of these various 20 chemicals are broken and then form solids. 21 It's a crude way of kind of 22 explaining the process. 23 Right? 24 A. Fairly well done, yes, sir. 25 Q. Okay. And it's these|\ninitiators or these catalysts that actually\nbreak the bonds and start that process.\nRight?\nA.   Yes, sir.\nQ.   So in the case of VCM, these\ninitiators or catalysts, they break one of\nthe chlorine bonds, leading to a reaction\nthat ultimately forms PVC.\nRight?",

And which training, refresher 11 or education from 1981 to the present do you 12 specifically recall discussing that concept? 13 MR. BRAGA: Object. 14 THE WITNESS: The VCM is a 15 polymerizable material. 16 And although oxygen is -- it's 17 oxygen purge -- the tank is oxygen 18 purged, that's when the car is running 19 down the tracks in normal operation, 20 going to and from a plant. 21 In a derailment situation, 22 things happen to cars. Fires start 23 and heat is applied, and oxygen can 24 get into the tanks. 25 We deal with vinyl chloride as|Page 41 1 QUESTIONS BY MR. GOMEZ: 2 Q.

From 1981 to the present, 18 throughout these trainings and education 19 courses and the like, what training have you 20 received about the signals that show VCM 21 polymerization in a railcar? 22 MR. BRAGA: Object. 23 THE WITNESS: Ask that question 24 again. 25|Page 45 1 things, PRD activation? 2 A. PRD activation. 3 One of the keys that we use and 4 teach first responders is if PRDs are going 5 off, and they stop going off and there's no 6 major change in operations, you haven't 7 applied large volumes of water, extinguished 8 fires around the cars and the PRDs go off, 9 that's a sign, that's a signal, that 10 something potentially could be going wrong 11 inside that car. 12 Q. So I want to focus just on the 13 activation rather than the activation and 14 then the sudden stopping. 15 Are you trained that the 16 activation of the PRDs alone is a sign or a 17 signal that polymerization is occurring in a 18 derailed VCM car? 19 A. No, sir. 20 Q. There are other explanations 21 for why the PRD in a derailed VCM car could 22 be activating. 23 Right? 24 A. Yes, sir. 25 Q. One of those explanations could|\nbe heating resulting in an increase in",

  "that's a statement in the SDS.\nPage 67 1 \"Chemical Stability: Generally stable at 2 normal temperatures and pressures; however, 3 may violently polymerize or generate other 4 hazardous conditions when not stabilized 5 and/or stored correctly.\" 6 Did I read that correctly? 7 A. Yes, sir. 8 Q. Is this a section that you 9 relied on in the course of responding to the 10 East Palestine derailment? 11 A. It's in the document, yes, sir. 12 Q. So the answer is, yes, you did 13 rely on it? 14 A. The document, yes, sir. 15 Q. And this is a statement in the 16 document. 17 Right? 18 A. Okay. This is going to be a 19 long, long day if we're going to keep going 20 back to this exact same discussion. 21 We used the entire document. 22 We had different people reading this 23 document.

BRAGA: I'm sorry, can you 9 read that back or restate it? 10 MR. GOMEZ: Sure. 11 Why don't I just ask it again. 12 MR. BRAGA: Whatever. 13 QUESTIONS BY MR. GOMEZ: 14 Q. At any point in time while you 15 were responding to the derailment, do you 16 recall discussion amongst the HAZMAT 17 responders about confusion generated by this 18 SDS? 19 A. There was a lot of discussion. 20 You have to define what responding to. Are 21 we responding mobilizing to the site? Are we 22 working on the site? What part are you 23 talking about? 24 Q. Sure. 25 At any point in time between|\nwhen you first arrived on-site the morning of\nFebruary 5th to the time of the vent and\nburn, that's what I'm referring to.\nA.

LEVINE: Objection. 10 THE WITNESS: There were a lot 11 of -- there was a lot of information 12 being fed into the technical group 13 about what was going on in the cars. 14 The one thing about this 15 document is, this is in normal 16 conditions. This is in a plant 17 operation. It's not on the side of a 18 derailed -- or in a city where a 19 derailment has occurred and excessive 20 heat has been applied to tank cars. 21 QUESTIONS BY MR.

  "Right?\nA.   That's correct.\nQ.   Okay. And the VCM involved in\nthe East Palestine derailment was in a tank\ncar.\nRight?",
  "A.   It was, but it was also exposed\nto excessive heat in a derailment.\nQ.   Okay. So your testimony is\nthat this Pamphlet 171 doesn't apply to the\nconditions that a VCM-containing railcar are\nexposed to in a derailment?",

LEVINE: Objection. 3 MR. BRAGA: Objection. 4 THE WITNESS: We base it on 5 visual observations, gathering as much 6 data as we can about the cars, 7 speaking to the manufacturers, coming 8 up with conclusions, developing a 9 response plan and implementing such 10 response plan. 11 QUESTIONS BY MR. GOMEZ: 12 Q. You mentioned observations and 13 data. 14 Does that include temperature 15 data? 16 A. At times, yes, sir, when you 17 can get it correctly. 18 Q. And then you take those data 19 and observations and discussions with the 20 product manufacturers to understand what 21 parts of this document might apply to a 22 derailment scenario. 23 Is that fair? 24 MR. LEVINE: Objection. 25 THE WITNESS: That is fair.|Page 101 1 THE WITNESS: That is correct. 2 QUESTIONS BY MR. GOMEZ: 3 Q. And would you agree with me 4 that it also shows that as temperature 5 decreases, pressure decreases? 6 A. That is correct. 7 Q. Would you also agree with me 8 that in connection with vinyl chloride 9 monomer, pressure cannot increase without a 10 corresponding increase in temperature? 11 A. Ask the question again. 12 Q. Sure. 13 Would you agree with me that 14 with respect to vinyl chloride monomer, VCM, 15 its temperature in a contained vessel cannot 16 increase without a corresponding increase in 17 pressure? 18 A. Correct. 19 Q. Okay. And the opposite is 20 true; there cannot be a corresponding 21 increase in pressure without also an increase 22 in temperature. 23 Right? 24 A. Correct. 25 Q. You see that there's a|\nreference in this chart to a PRD start to",
  "discharge setting 247.5 PSI?\nA.   Yes, sir.\nQ.   I think you discussed that\nearlier. That's the start to discharge\npressure for a pressure relief device.\nA.   Correct.\nQ.   Right?\nA.

GOMEZ: 6 Q. Okay. That's fair. 7 But we can agree that when 8 there's pressure equal to the start to 9 discharge for the PRDs that are equipped on 10 vinyl chloride monomer cars, the temperature 11 is at least 180 to 190 degrees? 12 A. That's what the graph says, 13 yes, sir. 14 Q. There's also, if we look at 15 this chart, a temperature reference 200. 16 Do you see that on the bottom 17 right? 18 A. Yes, sir. 19 Q. And again, just using the 20 chart, that corresponds to roughly 300 PSI in 21 pressure. 22 Right? 23 A. Yes, sir. 24 Q.

By that point in time, ten 12 o'clock on Sunday, February 5th, responders 13 were monitoring the temperature on the 14 derailed railcars. 15 Right? 16 A. Yes, sir. 17 Q. Did you provide Mr. Student 18 with those temperature readings? 19 A. There's a lot of discussion 20 about temperature and temperature readings 21 that were being taken. My concern was the 22 temperatures, because we were not getting 23 accurate readings of the core temperature of 24 the product. I was suspect that they were 25 getting -- they weren't accurate.|\nQ.   Whether you believe them to be\naccurate or not, did you share the readings\nthat you had with Mr. Student during this",
  "conversation on Sunday, February 5th?\nA.   In general terms, yes.\nQ.   Did you give him the specific\nnumbers?",
  "A.   I gave him general numbers.\nQ.   When you say \"general numbers,\"\nwhat does that mean?\nA.   150s to 160s to 180s.\nQ.   So you did not give him the",
  "specific temperature readings at each hour\nthat they were taken.\nRight?\nA.   That is correct.\nQ.   You did not give him the trend\nof the temperatures?\nA.   That is correct.",
  "Q.   Did you give Mr. Student any\npressure readings that you might have had?",
  "A.   Yes.\nQ.   And what pressure readings were\nthose?\nA.   60. Pressure reading. Single.\npersonnel in Dallas.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. GOMEZ:",
  "Q.   And did that information\ninclude the conclusion that polymerization\nwas not occurring?",
  "A.   That was some of the\ninformation that we were conflicted with.\nQ.   Okay. And what was\nMr. Student's response to that specific piece\nof information?",
  "A.   He didn't understand why\nsomebody in Dallas would say that\npolymerization was not occurring.\nQ.   Did he explain that any\nfurther?",
  "A.   No, sir.\nQ.   Did you ask him to explain that\nany further?\nA.   No, sir.",
  "Q.   So he told you that he was\nsurprised by that statement?\nIs that fair?\nA.   That's correct.",
  "Q.   And you didn't inquire any\nfurther as to why that might be the case?",
  "Page 131 1 Individual. 2 Q. Single reading. 3 You didn't give Mr. Student any 4 corresponding pressure reading based off of 5 the vapor pressure curve that we discussed 6 earlier. 7 Right? 8 A. I had a pretty good indication 9 that Mr. Student knew exactly where the 10 pressures would be. Should be. 11 Q. You understood that if you gave 12 Mr. Student general temperatures, he would 13 understand what the corresponding pressure 14 for VCM would be? 15 A. He's a pretty smart guy, yes, 16 sir. 17 Q. Did you tell Mr. Student that 18 at the time of that conversation, the evening 19 of Sunday, February 5th, the product 20 manufacturer, Oxy Vinyls, had concluded 21 polymerization was not occurring? 22 MR. LEVINE: Objection. 23 THE WITNESS: We had a 24 discussion about the conflicting 25 information we were receiving from Oxy|Page 133 1 A. He was inquisitive as I was. 2 We didn't know why somebody would say based 3 on the conditions that we were seeing that 4 polymerization was not occurring. 5 Q. If Mr. Student was a chemist, 6 could you have asked him for the chemical 7 explanation of what was likely going on in 8 those railcars? 9 MR. BRAGA: Objection. 10 THE WITNESS: You're asking me 11 to speculate, and I can't. I don't 12 know Pat was thinking. We were having 13 a conversation about the decision that 14 was made to vent and burn these cars. 15 QUESTIONS BY MR. GOMEZ: 16 Q. And I don't want you to 17 speculate about what Mr. Student was 18 thinking. But if he is a chemist, you could 19 have asked him for a chemical explanation of 20 what's happening in the cars. 21 Right? 22 MR. LEVINE: Objection. 23 THE WITNESS: I could. 24 QUESTIONS BY MR.

These two conversations that\nwe've been discussing, the first with Bob\nGold and the second with Pat Student, at any\ntime did you share that -- share the -- those\ndiscussions with NS personnel?\nA.   It most likely came up in",
  "discussions, yes.\nQ.   These two conversations, the\none with Bob Gold and the one with Pat\nStudent, did you discuss the contents of\nthose discussions with anyone at incident",

  "Q.   What do you recall specifically\nabout sharing the statements made by Bob Gold\nor Pat Student with employees of Oxy?",
  "A.   We've spoken to other former\nmanufacturers of VCM, and they don't feel\nthat -- or they feel that polymerization\ncould be occurring in these cars.\nQ.   And what was the response from\nOxy?\nA.   I don't remember.\nQ.   But Oxy never changed its\nPage 135 1 operation, did you happen to mention anything 2 about the conversation with Bob Gold or Pat 3 Student? 4 A. During the vent -- the 5 communications with incident command during 6 the vent and burn operation, it was strictly 7 to request permission to initiate and feed 8 information once the vent and burn was done. 9 Q. So other than that conversation 10 to get permission to initiate the vent and 11 burn, you did not have direct communication 12 with incident command? 13 A. That is correct. 14 Q. So to the extent that incident 15 command was aware of the discussions you had 16 with Bob Gold and Pat Student, that would 17 have had to come from someone at NS? 18 A. It would have had -- 19 MR.

Mr. Day, we can take down this 7 document. 8 We've taken for granted a 9 little bit of the timeline of your 10 involvement in the derailment, so I kind of 11 want to go back to the beginning there. 12 Am I correct that you were not 13 contacted by Norfolk Southern to respond to 14 the derailment; rather, you first reached out 15 to Norfolk Southern? 16 A.

Did you have a preexisting|Page 141 1 all watch, listen and try to gather 2 additional information. 3 I was mowing my pasture and 4 heard a news report that the fire was still 5 going on Saturday afternoon, and that's why I 6 sent the text to Dave asking what -- besides 7 plastic pellets and vinyl liquid, what else 8 was on fire. 9 Q. At the time you reached out to 10 Mr. Schoendorfer via text, did you know that 11 SPSI was on-site? 12 A. Yes, sir. 13 Q. Did you know that Mr. McCarty 14 was on-site? 15 A. If SPSI was on-site and -- yes. 16 Q. If SPSI is there, Mr. McCarty 17 is there? 18 A. Most likely. 19 Q. And in the past, has 20 Mr. McCarty reached out to you for 21 assistance? 22 A. Yes, sir. 23 Q. But he didn't reach out to you 24 for assistance on this derailment. 25 Right?|",

As a subcontractor for SPSI, 16 can you describe for me kind of the hierarchy 17 of decision-making between the two entities, 18 SRS and SPSI? 19 A. So SRS and SPSI are fierce 20 competitors.

The decision to make -- to do 7 the -- perform the vent and burn was from the 8 technical group to the Norfolk Southern to 9 the incident commander. 10 Q. When you say -- you've used 11 \"technical group\" a couple of times. 12 Is that just SPSI and SRS? 13 A. So the -- in these kinds of 14 incidents when Mr. Schoendorfer and I spoke, 15 they wanted SRS and SPSI to focus on the VCM 16 cars and the isobutylene car, compressed gas 17 cars, and the other contractors to focus on 18 the general service cars and the spill 19 cleanup. 20 Within that -- when SPSI and 21 SRS came together, we formed somewhat of a 22 technical group that were focused strictly on 23 the VCM. 24 Drew had a lot of other 25 operations going on.

No, sir. 19 Q. Okay. How many pool fires were 20 there? Or where were the pool fires, I 21 should say? 22 A. The pool fires were to the west 23 of four VCM cars, coming up on the fifth 24 toward the Leake Oil side of the incident. 25 Q. Okay.

I want to make sure I understand 13 this. 14 Your testimony is that there 15 were fires in the protective housings. 16 My question is, were the PRDs, 17 the pressure relief devices, were they 18 cycling? Were they actually letting out 19 product? 20 A. I'll say it one more time this 21 way. We had active fires in the protective 22 housings of three of the VCM cars.

GOMEZ: 18 Q. Did you ultimately concur, when 19 you arrived on-scene, with SPSI in their 20 determination that polymerization could be 21 occurring in the cars based off the behavior 22 of the PRDs? 23 A.

And according to his text 9 message, he's saying that his explanation of 10 why there was a delay between when the 11 decision was made to conduct a vent and burn 12 to the presentation to incident command was 13 to get more eyes on the cars and more 14 opinions about whether polymerization was 15 occurring. 16 Right? 17 MR. LEVINE: Objection. 18 MR. BRAGA: Objection. 19 THE WITNESS: That's basically 20 what it looks like it's saying, yes, 21 sir. 22 QUESTIONS BY MR. GOMEZ: 23 Q. And he mentions specific people 24 whose opinions he wanted. 25 Right?|\nA.   Yes, sir.\nQ.   There's a reference to you.\nRight?",
  "A.   Yes, sir.\nQ.   There's a reference to Terry.",
  "Right?\nA.   Yes, sir.\nQ.   That's Terry Rockwell.\nRight?\nA.   Yes, sir.\nQ.   And they wanted your opinions\nabout whether polymerization was occurring\nbefore actually making the recommendation and",

Understood. 10 I'm focusing just on his 11 explanation that he wants to get ahead of a 12 question about being at vent and burn on 13 Saturday afternoon and waiting until Sunday 14 to present to the fire chief. 15 You agree with me that his 16 explanation, at least according to this text 17 message, was he wanted more eyes on the 18 railcars, yours included. 19 Right? 20 MR.

Well, I'm asking you if what 15 you took this text message to mean, the one 16 that he sent you on March 26, 2023, was 17 Mr. McCarty trying to come up with an 18 explanation for if polymerization was an 19 imminent danger, why it took so long for him 20 to make that presentation to incident 21 command? 22 MR.

LEVINE: Objection. 10 THE WITNESS: Generally you 11 could come to that, yes. 12 QUESTIONS BY MR. GOMEZ: 13 Q.

Did you discuss at any point in 14 time with Bob Gold in connection with the 15 East Palestine derailment the need to keep 16 VCM cars cool? 17 A. Are you talking about 18 auto-refrigeration? 19 Q. No, I'm talking about actual 20 activities that responders can take to 21 actively cool VCM tank cars that are 22 derailed. 23 A. That are on fire? 24 Q. Yes. 25 A. Yes.|\nQ.

F-500 is a material 10 available to the fire service, just 11 like AR-AFFF, just like the new Green 12 foam, just like water. 13 The material, in order to -- 14 for it to cool, must be applied to the 15 shell of the car, not to the jacket. 16 Otherwise, you're wasting it. 17 QUESTIONS BY MR.

That e-mail that's on 4 the -- that starts on the second page, the 5 bottom of the second page of the exhibit, 6 that's an e-mail from Jason Poe to you. 7 Correct? 8 A. That is from him to me, yes, 9 sir. 10 Q. And the e-mail says, \"Chip, 11 here's my hold harmless. I will need NF to 12 sign before I make any shots.\" 13 Did I read that correctly? 14 A. That, you did. 15 Q. NF, do you understand that to 16 actually be a typo? It should be NS? 17 A. Sure. I can agree to that. 18 Q. The e-mail then goes on to say, 19 \"Please give this to whomever will make that 20 decision.\" 21 Right? 22 A. That's what it says. 23 Q. And the e-mail concludes, \"This 24 covers cover me for intentionally, 25 parentheses, as directed by them, from|\nputting the product in the air and on the\nground when I make the shots.\"\nDid I read that correctly?",

Have you -- before being 3 involved in the East Palestine derailment, 4 did you ever have the occasion to discuss 5 Mr. Poe or ESI's background with venting and 6 burning materials undergoing polymerization? 7 MR. LEVINE: Objection. 8 THE WITNESS: I don't 9 understand your question. 10 QUESTIONS BY MR. GOMEZ: 11 Q. Sure. 12 Before the East Palestine 13 derailment, had you ever discussed with 14 Mr. Poe or anyone else at ESI the company's 15 experience with carrying out a vent and burn 16 on materials that were considered to be 17 polymerizing? 18 A. We've talked about materials 19 that have the potential for polymerization, 20 yes. 21 Q. Did you ever, before the East 22 Palestine derailment, discuss with Jason Poe 23 or anyone else at ESI what kind of training 24 they had specifically to conducting a vent 25 and burn on material that was undergoing|\npolymerization?\nMR.

As you sit here today, are 8 you -- are you aware of the fact that Mr. Poe 9 said that ESI and he have no training on how 10 to conduct a vent and burn when materials are 11 undergoing active polymerization? 12 MR. BRAGA: Objection. 13 THE WITNESS: I don't -- didn't 14 hear that Mr. Poe said that. 15 We're not bringing Mr. Poe in 16 for his chemical expertise. We're 17 bringing Mr. Poe in for the specific 18 operation of applying explosives to 19 tank cars. 20 QUESTIONS BY MR. GOMEZ: 21 Q.

Okay. Did you read any of the 13 materials that were posted by the NTSB in 14 preparation for your panel testimony? 15 A. I listened to -- I read mine, 16 and that was pretty much it for the NTSB. 17 I read -- reread and studied my testimony. 18 Q. So let me just ask it this way. 19 If Mr. Poe gave a statement to 20 the NTSB where he said that he and his 21 company had no training on venting and 22 burning materials that were actively 23 undergoing polymerization, and he would not 24 have vented and burned materials actively 25 undergoing polymerization, would you disagree|Page 237 1 the facts. 2 Right? 3 MR. BRAGA: Objection. 4 QUESTIONS BY MR. GOMEZ: 5 Q. Let me withdraw the question. 6 I'll ask a different question. 7 How could Mr. Poe have 8 determined whether he was comfortable or not 9 with venting and burning in East Palestine if 10 he didn't know polymerization was actively 11 underway in the cars? 12 MR. LEVINE: Objection. 13 THE WITNESS: You're asking -- 14 I don't know. How should I know? I 15 don't know what he's thinking. 16 QUESTIONS BY MR. GOMEZ: 17 Q. And because you didn't tell him 18 that the cars were polymerizing. 19 Right? 20 MR. BRAGA: Objection. 21 THE WITNESS: The reason the 22 cars were vent and burned was because 23 we believed the cars were undergoing 24 polymerization. 25|\nQUESTIONS BY MR. GOMEZ:\nQ.

  "Q.   And who was with you in that\nlocation when the vent and burn was\ninitiated?\nA.   The ESI folks, some CTH {sic}\nfolks, the commissioner with a drone, and\nsome of the SRS folks.\nPage 239 1 Q. So you don't remember whether 2 you told him specifically the cars are 3 polymerizing or there's pressure building in 4 the cars? 5 A. That's correct, I do not 6 remember. 7 Q. We just touched upon the 8 investigative hearings a little bit. 9 You were on a panel with, among 10 others, Drew McCarty. 11 Right? 12 A. That's correct. 13 Q. And do you recall that there 14 were questions that were asked of you by the 15 NTSB and others regarding visual observations 16 of the vent and burn that you and Mr. McCarty 17 had made? 18 A. It's been a while since I read 19 it, but, vaguely, yes. 20 Q. Where were you located at the 21 time that the vent and burn was initiated? 22 A. On the Brave Industry side, 23 towards the tank farm -- or what became the 24 tank farm, protected by the Brave Industries 25 building where I could walk backwards from|Page 241 1 Q. You mentioned ESI folks. 2 Was Jason Poe there? 3 A. Yes, sir. 4 Q. And you said that you could see 5 the derailment, but can you estimate for me 6 just generally what your distance was? 7 A. Sir, I had a problem on-site. 8 I didn't know which direction was east and 9 which direction was west. I was turned 10 around because we flew in. 11 The building -- let's just say 12 200 yards from the front of the structure -- 13 100 yards from the front of the structure to 14 the back of the structure. A quarter mile 15 away. Probably 2,000, 2,500 feet. 16 Q. And from that distance when the 17 vent and burn was initiated, you believe that 18 you saw polymers ejected from the railcars. 19 Is that correct? 20 A. When we got permission to 21 initiate the vent and burn, we had the first 22 shot, which lit up the fuses. The next shot, 23 I backed up, and I saw what I thought were 24 sparklers coming out of the top of the 25 western-most car.|",

And the idea there is that\nbecause they had their jackets on, the water\nPage 279 1 possibly impacted the other VCM cars? 2 A. The couplers were -- I believe 3 the couplers were still attached between the 4 28 car and the 29 car. That's the way the 5 train was set up. In a derailment, cars pass 6 each other. 7 The wrecking contractors were 8 not comfortable hooking on to that car and 9 sliding it out of the way. 10 I personally was not on-site. 11 I was just advised that they could not move 12 that car. 13 Q.

Any of the fire training\nclasses at Pueblo, any fire training classes\ninvolving tank cars, crude by rail, ethanol\nby rail. It's a -- it's a common theme.\nQ.   The only thing, Mr. Day, I'll\ntell you that I'm struggling with a little\nbit is that there seems to be a consensus\nthat heat can be transferred from a pool\nfire, through a jacket, into the material\ninside the car. So I'm having trouble\nunderstanding why a car can't be cooled by\napplying water to the jacket and trying to\nmove heat off of it that way.\nA.

Didn't you just say, if you -16 can you -- could you have gone in and put out\nthe fire?\nQ.   Yeah. Yes. I was asking could\nyou put out the fire on the protective\nhousings of the three cars.\nA.   Most definitely, yes, sir.",
  "Q.   Okay. How would you have done\nthat?\nA.   Fire extinguisher.\nQ.   And why didn't you do that?\nPage 283 1 Heat transfer is a lot easier 2 than water transfer. 3 Q. Okay. 4 A. We can rip the jackets off but 5 also take -- it's also a very risky business 6 to put folks up on cars with active fires. 7 Q. So is it possible that the 8 jackets were deteriorated to the point where 9 if there had been water applied to the cars, 10 there could have been some cooling effect? 11 A. You're asking me to speculate, 12 and I try not to. I've been advised not to 13 speculate. It is what it is or it isn't. 14 Q. Sitting here today, though, you 15 can't tell me with certainty that there 16 couldn't have been some cooling effect to 17 applying water to the cars? 18 A. That's your opinion. I have my 19 own opinion. 20 Q. Now, you also said that there 21 were some fires that were burning in the 22 protective housings of two of the VCM cars? 23 A. Three of the VCM cars. 24 Q. Three of the VCM cars. 25 Now, they weren't burning in|Page 285 1 A. Because you have -- if you go 2 to the SDS and you go to the New Jersey 3 document that we spoke of earlier, you must 4 be able to control the release. 5 For some reason, those 6 protective housings are on fire. That means 7 it's releasing material. Something from 8 inside the car is leaking through, and you 9 have fire. 10 Now, if you go up there and 11 extinguish it, you must be able to control 12 those vapors that are coming out that used to 13 be on fire. Now you have an uncontrolled 14 flammable gas release. 15 Flammable gas -- VCM is heavier 16 than air. It flows off the side of the car, 17 gets to the ground, reaches out in fingers 18 and finds pockets. Once those pockets get 19 accumulated enough, it finds an ignition 20 source and flashes back. 21 Q. So your concern was -- I think 22 I understand what you're saying now. 23 My understanding is that your 24 concern was that if you put out those fires 25 that were in those protective housings, then|\nyou would just have gas that would pour over\nthe top, go down the side of the -- of the",

  "Q.   Thank you.\nNow, you also said that there\nwere these fires that were in the -- what did\nyou call it, the ballast rocks?\nA.   Yes, sir.\nQ.   Was there any attempt made to\nput those fires out?\nA.   Those fires flashed, and it",

  "February 6th, did you personally witness the\nattempts to put out that fire?\nA.   I don't recall.\nQ.   What about the use of foam to\nput out that fire? Was that ever tried? Do\nyou know?",
  "A.   That would be for the fire\nservice and for SPSI. I know foam was used\nat times.\nQ.   Do you know when it was used?\nA.   During the wrecking operation.\nQ.   Did you ever personally observe",

Was there any time where you\nPage 287 1 fire underneath the biggest pile of cars,\" 2 can you identify that for me on Exhibit 13? 3 A. From 31 going toward 44, 45. 4 Q. Okay. Was there ever any 5 attempt made to put the fire out underneath 6 those cars? 7 A. Multiple times. 8 Q. And can you describe those 9 attempts to me? 10 A. This might sound like a smart 11 ass. Laid a fire hose out, hooked up -- put 12 a nozzle on it, pressurized it with water, 13 opened the nozzle, sprayed foam, put out 14 fire. Fire flashed back. 15 The problem we have is, these 16 kind of fires, with all this equipment on 17 top, all these cars, all this material, 18 there's spot fires everywhere. As those spot 19 fires continue to burn, it's heating other 20 things, some of the stuff that you wouldn't 21 expect to burn, some of the lube oils and 22 stuff like that. 23 So you go in, you put the fire 24 out, then it would flash back. 25 Q. When were those attempts made|Page 289 1 ever saw unmanned hoses, water hoses, set up 2 to train water on the derailment? 3 A. There's a lot of pictures from 4 the night -- the night of the incident, and 5 there were times during the vent and burn 6 operation where unmanned monitors were set 7 up, and then during the wrecking operations 8 after the vent and burn. 9 Q. And that's actually the term I 10 was looking for, \"unmanned monitors.\" I 11 couldn't remember that. 12 Those are the unmanned water 13 hoses. 14 Right? 15 A. Correct. 16 Q. Were there any unmanned water 17 hoses set up between the time that you 18 arrived on the morning of February 5th and 19 the vent and burn? 20 A. There were. 21 Q. And where were those set up? 22 A. To protect Leake Oil and I 23 believe Brave Industries and the blue 24 building. 25 Q. Were there any that were set up|\nso that the water was being aimed at the\nderailment site?\nA.   The water was used to protect\nthe structures.\nQ.   So there was no water that was\nbeing put onto the derailed cars from these\nunmanned monitors.\nIs that correct?",
  "A.   Correct.\nQ.   And do you know why there was\nno water being aimed at the derailed cars\nfrom these unmanned monitors during that\ntime?",
  "A.   Some of it may have been trying\nto reduce the flow of water downstream. It\nwas washing contamination away from the site.\nQ.   Did anybody ever tell you that?\nA.   It was obvious.\nQ.   Did you ever discuss that with",
  "anybody?\nA.   I wasn't there for an\nenvironment -- for environmental issues. I\nwas there for compressed gas cars.\nQ.   Did you ever hear anyone\ndiscussing that?",

  "THE WITNESS: As I previously\nstated, applying water to jackets does\nnothing to cool product.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. BYARS:",
  "Q.   What if you're -- what if the\nwater is being applied to the -- to the\nballast rock or to the fire that was\nunderneath cars from, I think you said, 31 -13 Car 31 to Car 45? Would there have been a\ncooling effect on the VCM cars then?",
  "MR. LEVINE: Objection.\nTHE WITNESS: You can't apply\nwater to a jacketed car and expect\ncooling to take place.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. BYARS:",
  "Q.   I guess I'm asking, what if you\nweren't applying the water to the jacketed\ncar but instead were applying it to what the\ncar was sitting on?",
  "A.   You're asking me for\nspeculation. I'm not going to speculate.\nPage 291 1 A. There's -- the cleanup is still 2 going on, so obviously there's been a lot of 3 discussion about it. 4 Q. Okay. When you were there from 5 the morning of February 5th until the vent 6 and burn, did you ever hear anyone discussing 7 not putting water on the derailment site 8 because of the flow of water downstream that 9 would result? 10 A. Is that a question? 11 Q. Yes. 12 A. Could you restate it? 13 Q. I sure can. 14 When you were at the derailment 15 site from the morning of February 5th until 16 the vent and burn, did you ever hear anyone 17 discussing not putting water on the 18 derailment site because of the flow of water 19 downstream that would result? 20 A. No. 21 Q. Do you think that if there had 22 been water -- strike that. 23 Do you think if there had 24 been -- if the unmanned monitors had been 25 used to put water on the derailment site from|Page 293 1 Q. So -- all right. If you had to 2 guess, and I know you don't like to do this, 3 but what would be your guess as to whether 4 that would have had any cooling effect on the 5 VCM cars? 6 MR. BRAGA: Objection. 7 You can go ahead and guess. 8 THE WITNESS: I hate to guess. 9 It possibly could. It possibly could 10 not. 11 QUESTIONS BY MR. BYARS: 12 Q. Sitting here today, you can't 13 tell me that there would not have been a 14 cooling effect had water been applied to the 15 areas underneath the VCM cars? 16 MR. LEVINE: Objection. 17 THE WITNESS: Pumping water on 18 a jacketed car does virtually no help 19 to cool -- the cooling. It's been 20 proven dozens of times in incidents 21 across the country involving jacketed 22 cars. 23 QUESTIONS BY MR. BYARS: 24 Q. What about pumping water to the 25 area that the cars are sitting on?|\nMR. LEVINE: Same objection.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. BYARS:",

  "Q.   And do you see Car 54, which is\nright up against Car 55?\nA.   I do see that.\nQ.   Do you recall if Car 54 was on\nfire?\nA.   It was a smoldering fire, yes,\nsir.",
  "Q.   Was any water ever applied to\nCar 54?\nA.   No, there was not. Not until\nthe end.\nQ.   When you say \"until the end,\"",

  "Car 54 that was burning.\nQ.   So do you not recall whether it\nwas ever considered to put foam on Car 54?\nA.   I don't know what was in",
  "Car 54, so I wouldn't ever know what was\nPage 295 1 Q. So that was after the vent and 2 burn? 3 A. That was after the vent and 4 burn. 5 Q. So before -- or from the 6 morning of February 5th when you arrived at 7 the derailment scene until the vent and burn, 8 there was no water that was put on Car 54. 9 Is that right? 10 A. That is correct. 11 Q. And why is that? 12 A. We were -- I mean, 13 environmentally, any water you flow on that 14 car is going to go to the ground, and it's 15 going to wash more contamination downstream. 16 And the environmental folks had a heck of 17 problem going on with contamination getting 18 off-site. 19 Q. So were you instructed not to 20 put water on that car because of the possible 21 runoff? 22 A. I was not. 23 MR. LEVINE: Objection. 24 QUESTIONS BY MR. BYARS: 25 Q. Did you make the decision not|Page 297 1 going to be -- could be used to extinguish 2 the fire. 3 Q. Do you know what the condition 4 of the valves were on the Car 28? That's the 5 Trinity VCM car. 6 A. They must have been in really 7 good shape, because they were able to hook up 8 to the -- either the vapor valve or the 9 sample port and get a gauge pressure on it. 10 Q. Would it have been possible to 11 transfer the VCM inside of Car 28 through one 12 of those valves? 13 MR. BRAGA: Objection. 14 THE WITNESS: Anything is 15 possible. 16 QUESTIONS BY MR. BYARS: 17 Q. Did you con -- did you consider 18 doing that? 19 A. We had to have a place to go 20 with the material, which means we either had 21 to have tank cars or tank trucks, and then we 22 had to have a place to go with that material 23 that was going to accept it. 24 And there's still the potential 25 for it to be a reactive material, which means|\nwe would have to put it on a road or put it\non railroad tracks and taken it -- let's just\nsay OxyChem -- Oxy Vinyls accepted that\nmaterial back to Houston. We would have had",
  "to road that stuff all the way back.\nQ.   Do you know if anyone tried to\nobtain a tank car that the VCM from Car 28\ncould have been transferred to?",
  "A.   I have no idea.\nQ.   Do you know if anyone tried\nto -- or tried to find someone who would\ntransport a tank car filled with VCM that had",
  "been transferred from Car 28?\nA.   The transfer to a receiving car\nor truck is one part of the puzzle, but\nthere's several other steps that's got -17 that have to be made in order to get that\ndone, yes, sir.",
  "I don't -- I don't know of\nanyone that looked for transportation\nservices.\nQ.   Okay. And did you ever talk to",
  "OxyChem about the possibility of transferring\nVCM from Car 28 into a tank car?\nA.   The plan was to -- the initial",
  "Q.   Aside from Car 54, were there\nany other non-VCM cars that were on fire\nbetween February 5th when you arrived at the\nderailment and the time of the vent and burn?",
  "A.   You see the smoke in the pile?\nQ.   I do see that.\nA.   There you go.\nQ.   Do you know which cars those",

  "Q.   So we can actually look at\nExhibit 13 here and look at the table on the\nleft side, and that may help us.",
  "So as we've talked about\nalready, the VCM cars are denoted in red on\ntheir line numbers.\nAnd then I think that you had",
  "Page 299 1 plan when wrecking operations started 2 Saturday night were to move that car out and 3 get it into the clear and perform the vent 4 and burn operation on the other four cars. 5 Q. Do you recall how far you were 6 planning to move Car 28 into the clear, 7 assuming you had been able to do so? 8 A. Down yonder. We were -- we 9 were moving it across the tracks toward the 10 Leake Oil side and down the way to get it 11 away from the fire from the vent and burn. 12 Q. Can you give me an estimate 13 just in terms of yards? 14 A. Several hundred. 15 Q. I like the down yonder, by the 16 way. That sounds like a technical term from 17 Texas. 18 All right. So several -- you 19 were looking to move it several hundred yards 20 down towards Leake Oil. All right. 21 A. No, it was across from Leake 22 Oil -- 23 Q. Sorry. 24 A. -- so away from Leake Oil, on 25 the Leake Oil side.|Page 301 1 mentioned Cars 32 to 45 having fire around 2 them. That's the general area of that smoke. 3 So from Cars 32 to 45, can you 4 look at Exhibit 13 and tell me if any of 5 those cars are jacketed cars? 6 A. Okay. So Car 49 is a DOT 7 105J300W car. That's an isobutylene car. 8 Q. Okay. 9 A. That's a jacketed car. Because 10 that J means it's jacketed. 11 The unfortunate part when it 12 gets to general service cars, 111A100W1 cars, 13 could or could not have jackets. There's 14 no differentiation. It doesn't put a J in 15 there to tell us, so you have to look at each 16 individual car. 17 Q. The hop -- 18 A. The 117J100W is a jacketed car 19 because it's got a J in that. However, the J 20 does not always mean it's got a jacketed -- 21 or excuse me. J means it has a jacket. The 22 A does not always dictate that it has a 23 jacket. 24 Q. And then what about Car 42, 25 which was AAR 211? I'll omit the rest of the|\nnumbers and letters. Was that a jacketed\ncar?\nA.   A 111A is the same as a DOT\nA. It could have a jacket. It could not\nhave a jacket.\nQ.   Okay. And the hopper cars\nweren't jacketed.\nIs that right?",
  "A.   The hopper cars are hopper\ncars.\nQ.   Okay. So if any of the hopper\ncars were the sources of those fires, could\nhave applied water to those, and those fires",
  "might have gone out.\nIs that right?\nA.   And the risk of another PRD\ngoing off, now you have firefighters, first",
  "responders, in, setting up unmanned monitors\nand streams, pumping water to it, washing\ncontamination down the stream. And the setup",
  "is -- it's a risk-based determination that\nwe're not going to apply water.\nQ.   Well, how long does it take to\nset up an unmanned monitor?\nA.   Depends on how far we have to\nQ.   And were there -- was there\never anyone who was there for a period of,",
  "say, 30 minutes?\nA.   Possibly.\nQ.   How about an hour?\nA.   Possibly.\nQ.   Two hours?\nA.   Oh, my God. Okay. We can -9 we can go down this road as far as you want",
  "to go. An hour, two hours, three hours.\nWe -- there was a lot of work going in, being\ndone and coming back out, gathering data,\ngathering information, making plans.\nQ.   So just -- I understand,\nMr. Day, that this can be frustrating, and",

But the City of 6 East Palestine doesn't have the water supply 7 for a 10,000 GPM operation. 8 Q. How long would it have taken to 9 set up unmanned monitors on this pile of cars 10 from Car 32 to Car 45? 11 A. Most likely several hours. 12 Q. Was there any point in time 13 from the time that you arrived on the morning 14 of February 5th until the vent and burn when 15 personnel were absent from the derailment 16 site for several hours? 17 A. There were a lot of times. 18 Q. So there were times when nobody 19 was at the derailment site? 20 A. That's correct. 21 Q. Okay. Were there times when 22 people were present at the derailment site 23 for several hours? 24 A. There were a lot of operations 25 going on, so people were in and out.|Page 305 1 can do next, what is safe for the 2 folks to do. 3 So crews would go in, they 4 would take some air monitoring 5 readings.

There were 7 crews that would go in to try to do an 8 assessment from a different angle. 9 There's a lot of operations 10 going on simultaneously. Crews are 11 going in and out. 12 QUESTIONS BY MR. BYARS: 13 Q. So can you tell me, sitting 14 here today, that from the time that you 15 arrived at the derailment site on the morning 16 of February 5th until the vent and burn, that 17 there was never anyone who was at the 18 derailment site for two hours? 19 MR. LEVINE: Objection. 20 THE WITNESS: The longest time 21 that I personally know folks were on 22 scene is when we were setting up the 23 explosives. 24 QUESTIONS BY MR. BYARS: 25 Q. Okay.

That's a contract department 6 question. 7 Q. But you did respond -- you were 8 an emergency response contractor for them? 9 A. Yes, ma'am. 10 Q. Were there any particular 11 people at Oxy that you knew? 12 A. Oh, there's a lot of people I 13 know. 14 Q. Okay. Who would you -- who do 15 you know at Oxy? 16 A. Diane Larson.

At any time after -- and I 4 assume you didn't know who Alex Torres was? 5 A. No, ma'am. 6 Q. Okay. Have you met -- and you 7 had not met him before February 3, 2023? 8 A. Not that I can recall. 9 Q. At any time between February 3, 10 2023, and the date of the vent and burn, 11 February 6, 2023, did you attempt to call or 12 text either Mr. Smith or Mr. Cox while they 13 were on the scene? 14 A. You've got my text logs. I 15 don't remember. 16 Q. So if they're not on any 17 texts -- if there are no texts on those logs 18 to either Mr. Smith or Mr. Cox, they didn't 19 happen? 20 A. That would be my assumption. 21 Q. So we don't have your call 22 logs. We have your text logs, but we don't 23 have your calls logs. 24 Did you try to call Mr. Cox or 25 Mr. Smith between February 3rd and|\nFebruary 6, 2023?\nA.   I don't remember.",

On the Leake Oil side of this 13 derailment. 14 A. We drove past the Leake Oil 15 side of the response. 16 Q. Okay. And where did you go? 17 A. To the command center. 18 Q. And where was the command 19 center at that time? 20 A. In town. 21 Q. Was it at the fire station, the 22 school, a trailer? Where was it? 23 A. There -- I didn't know how it 24 was all set up. 25 Q.

  "like maybe an old fire station. Who knows.\nQ.   Okay. Somewhere in town in a\nbuilding that might have been the fire\nfolks in Dallas?\nA.   In a Suburban outside of the\nSPSI trailer east of the Leake Oil side of",

  "Page 327 1 station? 2 A. That's absolutely correct. 3 Q. Okay. Great. 4 And what did you do when you 5 arrived? 6 A. Walked inside. Saw that there 7 was a lot of commotion going on. Seeked out 8 some NS folks. I met Mr. Williams, may have 9 been Mr. Schoendorfer and Mr. -- Scott 10 Deutsch. 11 There were several NS folks in 12 the -- in that room that they are -- 13 Q.

And how soon after you 19 arrived did you participate in the conference 20 call with the Oxy folks in Dallas? 21 A. It would have been sometime 22 after that. Before we did the drone 23 overflight. 24 Q. Where did the conference call 25 on your end happen with the Oxy corporate|Page 329 1 A. Not that I know of. 2 Q. Do you know who was on the call 3 from Oxy in Dallas? 4 A. Oxy people. 5 Q. Do you have any names? 6 A. No. 7 Q. Did anyone identify themselves 8 during the call? 9 A. Several people identified 10 themselves, but I don't remember who they 11 were. 12 Q. You don't remember any of the 13 names? 14 A. No, ma'am. 15 Q. Do you remember how many people 16 spoke on the call? 17 A. I didn't pay that much 18 attention to that part of it, no. 19 Q. Did more than one person speak 20 on the call for Oxy? 21 A. I'm going to guess yes. 22 Q. And who spoke as between -- or 23 among you, Mr. Rockwell, Mr. McCarty and 24 Mr. Farquhar? 25 A. We basically listened, if my|\nmemory serves me correct.\nQ.   Did you guys say anything at\nall on the call?\nA.   Not on the call, no.\nQ.   Did Mr. McCarty or Mr. Rockwell",

  "don't remember what or who.\nThe only takeaway from that was\na -- someone that I don't know, that Terry\nknows -- Terry Rockwell knows very well, said\nhe didn't believe polymerization could occur.",
  "Or -- yes, could occur.\nAnd at the end of that\nconversation, at the end of it completely,\nnobody challenged this person. When he was\nYou didn't ask anyone from Oxy",
  "to explain the basis for their conclusion?\nA.   I did not.\nQ.   And no one else in the truck\nasked anybody from Oxy to explain the basis\nfor their conclusion?",

  "call?\nA.   The unfortunate -24       MR. BRAGA: Objection.\nTHE WITNESS: The unfortunate\nPage 331 1 either put on mute or hung up, the four of us 2 that were in the truck looked at each other, 3 like, I can't believe he actually said that. 4 Because based on our training, that's 5 potentially what was going on. 6 Q. Okay. When the Oxy 7 representative said that he didn't believe 8 polymerization could occur or was occurring, 9 did you ask him why he believed that or said 10 that? 11 A. No, ma'am. 12 Q. Did you ask him any questions 13 about how he drew those conclusions? 14 A. Ma'am, I just said that I did 15 not make any -- I was not talking in that 16 truck. I was listening. 17 Q. Okay. Did anybody else in that 18 truck ask the Oxy representative any 19 questions about the statement he made about 20 the possibility of the poly -- of the VCM 21 polymerizing? 22 A. Not until after the call had 23 ended. 24 Q. So let me make sure I have this 25 absolutely clear.|Page 333 1 part is, we're contractors. When 2 somebody says something like that, if 3 he was wrong, we're going to call them 4 out in front of superiors and 5 underlings. Not really good for a 6 contractor to do. 7 So there's a lot of 8 communications that probably took 9 place, that did take place afterwards, 10 going, you got to show some respect. 11 The incident was, at the point, 12 pretty -- getting pretty critical. 13 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 14 Q. Uh-huh. 15 A. We could not, at the time, take 16 all his information at face value. We needed 17 to check other sources, which is the exact 18 reason I called Bob Gold, the exact reason we 19 talked amongst ourselves. 20 When the OxyChem folks showed 21 up, one of the first things Mr. Cox said was, 22 I guess I'm going to have to go to Dallas and 23 explain what the P on the DOT guidebook 24 means. 25 Q. Okay. We'll get to that. I|\nwant to know about the conversation you had",

Do you recall Norfolk Southern 6 reacting to the conversation that you had 7 with Oxy Vinyls on the morning of 8 February 5th? 9 A. No, ma'am. 10 Q. Do you recall them saying 11 anything about Oxy Vinyls' conclusion that 12 polymerization was not happening? 13 A. No, ma'am. 14 Q. So your next step was to take 15 it upon yourself to do some independent 16 research to figure out if Oxy Vinyls' 17 statements were true? 18 MR. BRAGA: Objection. 19 THE WITNESS: Yes, ma'am. 20 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 21 Q. And I believe earlier today we 22 talked about who you reached out to to have 23 those conversations with, so I don't want to 24 retread that ground, but I do want to mark a 25 document as an exhibit.|Page 337 1 to ask his opinion about the possibility that 2 the vinyl chloride was polymerizing? 3 A. That's the guy. 4 Q. Set that aside. 5 MR. BRAGA: All done with that? 6 MS. BROZ: Yep. Just wanted to 7 make sure we had the right person. 8 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 9 Q.

Could have been Terry Rockwell 7 or Kent Farquhar or both of them. 8 Q. But you have no specific 9 recollection as to who was in the trailer at 10 the time? 11 A. No, ma'am. 12 Q. And who from NS was there? 13 A. Either Mr. Gould, Mr. Deutsch. 14 Most likely one of those two guys. 15 Q. But you don't have any specific 16 recollection of either of them being there? 17 A. No, ma'am. 18 Q. Okay. Can you tell me how the 19 conversation started between you and the 20 individuals on the ground from Oxy Vinyls? 21 A. Well, most likely we probably 22 hugged each other because we are friends. 23 Q. Uh-huh. 24 A. Hey, what's going on. What's 25 happening here, and we described what we've|Page 341 1 A. Very few. 2 Q.

You handed those over to your 14 counsel? 15 A. I did. 16 MR. BRAGA: They've been 17 produced. 18 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 19 Q. Okay. So you had a 20 conversation. 21 What I want to focus on is the 22 conversation that you had with Steve Smith 23 and Justin Cox -- we'll put Alex to the 24 side -- in the trailer when they first 25 arrived on February 5, 2023.|\nDo you remember statements that",
  "they made during that conversation?\nA.   I can make this real easy. No.\nQ.   Do you remember any statements\nthat you made during that conversation?",

  "A.   I do not know.\nQ.   Okay. When was the next time\nthat you met with either Mr. Smith or\nMr. Cox?\nA.   I'm thinking it may have been",
  "when we did the drone -- or not the drone\nflight, but the next time -- it would have\nbeen on the Leake Oil side. They were\nPage 343 1 you? 2 A. That would be a question for 3 the Oxy Vinyls folks. 4 Q. No, I'm asking you if you asked 5 them for any information that they were 6 supposed to gather and return back to you. 7 It's a bad question. Let me 8 restate it. 9 Did you ask Oxy Vinyls for any 10 information, or did you ask them any 11 questions that they couldn't answer and they 12 said they would get back to you? 13 MR. BRAGA: Objection. 14 THE WITNESS: There was 15 obviously a discussion, and we've 16 already touched on it, about the 17 polymerization potential and the 18 comment that the gentleman made on the 19 conference call. And I believe -- 20 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 21 Q. You talked -- 22 A. -- that's sometime in the 23 trailer, outside of the trailer, in the 24 Suburban, outside of the Suburban, when 25 Mr. Cox said, I guess I need to go to Dallas,|Page 345 1 getting -- trying to get the lay of the land 2 and getting as close as they can. They've 3 got, you know, particular requirements. 4 They're not allowed to go different places. 5 So I think they were with us in 6 the exclusion -- or at the edge of the 7 exclusion zone looking at the derailment. 8 Q. Do you remember any 9 conversations that you had during that 10 meeting? 11 A. We talked about the -- I 12 remember we talked outside about -- so I'm 13 thinking it's possibly at Leake Oil -- about 14 potential for polymerization, what we were 15 thinking. And that's when Mr. Smith said 16 emphatically, several times, that he's not a 17 polymerization expert, and he doesn't know. 18 Q. Did Mr. Smith, during that 19 conversation, also tell you that he would go 20 and ask Dallas about it and let you know what 21 the folks at Dallas said about the 22 possibility of polymerization? 23 A. I don't remember. 24 Q. Did he -- Mr. Smith ever come 25 back to you between February 3rd and|\nFebruary 6, 2023, and tell you, I've spoken",
  "to our folks in Dallas, and they don't\nbelieve that polymerization is happening?\nA.   Yes, ma'am.\nQ.   Okay. And when did he tell you",
  "that?\nA.   Sometime after that.\nQ.   Okay. And then after Mr. Smith\ntold you that, how did you respond?\nA.   In -- I was -- I was -- I was\nsurprised. I know that Oxy has a lot of",

They would come to 17 these meetings when we discussed things.
