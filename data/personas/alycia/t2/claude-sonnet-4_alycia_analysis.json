  "chunk_0-0": "Focus immediately on challenging the witness's admission that Norfolk Southern considered re-railing the Trinity car despite later claiming it posed a polymerization risk. Press hard on the inconsistency between their re-railing decision and their subsequent justification for the vent-and-burn operation - this contradiction undermines their entire safety rationale and could be devastating to their defense.",
  "chunk_0-1": "**Recommended Next Step:**\n\nImmediately follow up with: \"What specific factors does Norfolk Southern consider when deciding whether to re-rail a derailed car?\" \n\nThis capitalizes on the admission while the witness is in agreement mode, and will either lock down helpful testimony about their decision-making criteria or reveal inconsistencies in their reasoning. The witness just confirmed something significant - now nail down the underlying process before they have time to reconsider their answer.",
  "chunk_0-2": "Focus immediately on defining the temporal scope of \"stable\" - specifically pin down the exact timeframe between when the witness observed the car as \"stable\" and when the incident occurred. The witness has conceded stability \"at the time it was observed\" but left critical wiggle room about what happened next and how long that stability lasted.",
  "chunk_0-3": "Based on this excerpt, I would focus on immediately clarifying the witness's admission about the detonation and burn. The witness just confirmed a critical fact with \"That's correct.\" \n\nMy next strategic move would be to lock down this admission with specific, non-leading follow-up questions that nail down the precise details of what the witness knows about the detonation timing, the burn that resulted, and his basis for that knowledge - before opposing counsel can rehabilitate or the witness can backtrack on this damaging concession.",
  "chunk_0-4": "Focus immediately on defining what \"performed exactly as it was built to perform\" means in concrete, technical terms. Ask the witness to specify the exact design parameters, safety thresholds, and intended failure modes that were supposedly met, then systematically compare those specifications against the actual derailment conditions and outcomes to expose any gaps between design intent and catastrophic reality.",
  "chunk_0-5": "**Next Strategic Move:**\n\nImmediately object to the foundation of this question and move to strike the witness's answer. The question assumes facts not in evidence regarding how the device \"should\" act in a derailment - this is calling for expert opinion and legal conclusions beyond this witness's established expertise. Then pivot to establish the witness's actual knowledge limitations about derailment protocols and device specifications through targeted foundational questions before allowing any testimony about the device's performance.",
  "chunk_0-6": "Focus immediately on clarifying the witness's role and specific observations regarding the damaged bolster claim. Ask: \"What specifically did you observe about the condition of Trinity's 2025 car's bolster when you were on the ground managing the derailment response?\" This pins down their direct knowledge versus assumptions and establishes the foundation for challenging Norfolk Southern's stated reason for not re-railing the car.",
  "chunk_0-7": "**Recommended Next Step:**\n\nImmediately follow up with: \"What specific role, if any, did Trinity play in the derailment response?\" \n\nThe witness just gave a clean \"No\" to faulting Trinity, but the incomplete question about consultation creates an opening. I need to nail down Trinity's actual involvement before opposing counsel can rehabilitate or the witness can backtrack. This builds the foundation for either establishing Trinity's limited role (supporting our position) or revealing their deeper involvement (creating accountability), depending on where the testimony leads."
