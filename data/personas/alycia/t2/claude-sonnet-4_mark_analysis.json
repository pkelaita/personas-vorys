  "chunk_0-0": "Based on this transcript excerpt, if I were representing the deponent (Robert Wood), the single most important strategic move would be:\n\n**Immediately clarify and contextualize the \"decision tree\" reference to prevent oversimplification of the re-railing decision process.**\n\nThe opposing counsel is building toward painting Norfolk Southern as reckless by suggesting they would re-rail a potentially dangerous car. Wood's admission that re-railing \"was part of the decision tree\" opens the door to explore the full complexity of that decision-making process, including what other safety factors, monitoring protocols, and contingency plans were simultaneously being considered. This prevents the misleading narrative that re-railing was a simple, singular decision made without proper safety considerations.",
  "chunk_0-1": "Based on this transcript excerpt, I would focus on immediately clarifying the specific factual predicate underlying Mr. Swanson's question about Norfolk Southern's decision-making process.\n\n**Next strategic move:** Ask the witness to precisely define what \"re-railing Trinity's 2025\" means in operational terms - the specific equipment, personnel, timeline, and safety protocols involved - before allowing any conclusion about Norfolk Southern's consideration of this action.\n\nThis \"scene painting\" approach will either expose gaps in the witness's knowledge of the actual re-railing process or establish the factual foundation necessary to meaningfully evaluate Norfolk Southern's decision-making, preventing conclusory testimony built on undefined technical assumptions.",
  "chunk_0-2": "**Next Strategic Move:** Immediately challenge the temporal limitation in the witness's answer about stability.\n\nFocus on this line of questioning: \"Mr. [Witness], when you say 'at the time it was observed,' are you suggesting the car's stability changed after your observation? What specific factor would cause a car with those pressure and temperature readings to become unstable? How long does such a transition typically take, and what monitoring protocols should have been in place to detect it?\"\n\nThis directly attacks the witness's attempt to hedge their testimony about stability and forces them to either commit to the car being stable throughout the relevant time period or explain the technical basis for any claimed instability - potentially exposing gaps in monitoring procedures or revealing the true timeline of events.",
  "chunk_0-3": "**Focus immediately on challenging the foundation for the witness's knowledge of the temperature and pressure readings.**\n\nSpecifically, I would pursue: \"Before we discuss what these readings told you, let's establish exactly how you obtained these temperature and pressure readings from Trinity's 2025 - walk me through each step of that process, what equipment you used, when you took them, and what documentation exists of these measurements.\"\n\nThis targets the system architecture behind the data collection while building the factual foundation necessary to either corroborate or undermine the witness's conclusions about the detonation effects.",
  "chunk_0-4": "**Next Strategic Move:** Immediately drill down on the specific pressure and temperature readings data - demand the exact numbers, timestamps, and documentation. Ask: \"What were the precise pressure readings at each timestamp?\" \"Where is this data recorded?\" \"Who has access to these readings?\" \n\nThis creates a foundation to systematically map the data architecture and potentially expose gaps between what the witness claims the readings show versus what the actual documented data reveals. The witness just admitted the system \"performed exactly as built\" - now lock down the technical evidence that supports or contradicts that critical concession.",
  "chunk_0-5": "Based on this excerpt, I would focus on **immediately clarifying what \"acted exactly as it should\" means in concrete, technical terms**. \n\nThe witness just made a broad conclusory statement that the device performed correctly during the derailment. My next line of questioning would systematically break down the device's specific functions, performance parameters, and expected behaviors during a derailment scenario to either substantiate this claim with technical details or expose gaps in the witness's knowledge of the actual system architecture and performance standards.\n\nThis aligns with my approach of diving deep into system architecture to uncover where information resides and how systems actually function, rather than accepting conclusory statements at face value.",
  "chunk_0-6": "Focus immediately on the witness's contradiction regarding the bolster damage - they just testified \"No\" when asked if their understanding was that Norfolk Southern didn't re-rail Trinity's car due to a damaged bolster. This creates a critical opening to establish what the witness actually believes caused the re-railing decision and to lock down their testimony on the technical condition of the car, which appears central to liability allocation between the parties.",
  "chunk_0-7": "**Focus immediately on Trinity's specific role and knowledge regarding the decision-making process.**\n\nAsk: \"What exactly did Norfolk Southern tell Trinity about why they were making this decision, when did they tell them, and what information did Trinity provide back to Norfolk Southern during that consultation process?\"\n\nThis targets the critical gap between \"no fault\" and \"not consulted before the decision\" - there's likely a consultation that happened during or after the decision that could reveal Trinity had relevant expertise or concerns that weren't properly considered in the timing of the decision-making process."
