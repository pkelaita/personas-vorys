I will use the \"decision tree\" he mentioned to demonstrate that the final vent-and-burn decision was based on the evolving, collective risk of all railcars, not the static, isolated condition of a single car.",
  "chunk_0-1": "Object to the incomplete hypothetical question and instruct the witness not to answer a question that has not been fully asked.",
  "chunk_0-2": "Take a break. Instruct the witness that he did perfectly by qualifying his answer with \"At the time it was observed,\" and that he must continue to limit his answers strictly to the specific data points he knows, refusing to adopt counsel's characterization of stability \"right up to\" the incident.",

  "chunk_0-4": "On redirect, I will have the witness clarify that while a specific safety feature may have activated as intended under catastrophic, off-design conditions, the product was not \"built to perform in a derailment,\" thereby reframing his admission to focus on damage mitigation rather than intended use.",

  "chunk_0-6": "On redirect, I will ask the simple follow-up question that opposing counsel was clearly afraid to ask: \"You testified that the car was not left behind because of a damaged bolster. Why, then, did Norfolk Southern choose not to re-rail the 2025 car?\"",
  "chunk_0-7": "Object that the question is vague and lacks foundation as to \"the decision,\" and instruct the witness not to speculate."
