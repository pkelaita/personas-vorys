  "chunk_0-0": "On redirect, establish that the decision calculus was not based on the Trinity car in isolation. Use the timeline and incident reports to demonstrate how external factors\u2014specifically, the status of the surrounding fire and the deteriorating condition of *other* cars\u2014overrode the initial assessment and made re-railing the Trinity car an unacceptable risk to the entire scene.",
  "chunk_0-1": "Take a break to instruct the witness to stop agreeing with leading questions and to base their answers only on what they personally know, not on speculation about corporate decision-making.",
  "chunk_0-2": "On redirect, establish the precise frequency and duration of the \"observations\" mentioned, highlighting the time gaps between each reading to dismantle the narrative that the car was in a continuous, known \"stable\" state.",
  "chunk_0-3": "On redirect, I would establish that \"detonated\" was opposing counsel's word, not my client's, and have the witness describe the procedure using the precise, technical terminology from his training and the official operating manuals.",
  "chunk_0-4": "Call for an immediate break to confer with the witness. Upon resuming, I will use my own questions to clarify and correct his testimony, forcing him to walk back his agreement that the component performed \"exactly\" as designed and limit his answer to his specific, personal knowledge of its performance.",
  "chunk_0-5": "On redirect, I will rehabilitate the witness by having them define what they understood \"acted exactly as it should\" to mean\u2014likely focusing on the device's main safety purpose\u2014thereby framing whatever specific inconsistency opposing counsel raises as a minor detail that does not change the overall successful outcome.",
  "chunk_0-6": "At the next break, I will press my witness on the factual basis for his \"No\" answer to determine the *actual* reason the 2025 car wasn't re-railed, so I am prepared for the document my opponent inevitably has on that point.",
  "chunk_0-7": "On redirect, establish the precise basis of this witness's knowledge regarding the decision-making process. I need to confirm who they personally observed being consulted to cabin their testimony, preventing a simple \"no\" from being interpreted as a corporate-wide admission that no one from Trinity was ever consulted by anyone."
