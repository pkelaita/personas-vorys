  "chunk_0-0": "On redirect, I would immediately focus on the witness's key qualifier, \"originally,\" and ask him to build a narrative timeline that explains why that initial assessment changed, thereby contextualizing his previous answers. My first question would be: \"Mr. Wood, you testified that you *originally* believed the car was a candidate for re-railing. Please walk us through, chronologically, every piece of new information, data, or observation that caused that expert assessment to evolve over time.\"",
  "chunk_0-1": "My next questions will break down the actual, on-the-ground process for making a re-rail decision, focusing only on this witness's direct knowledge and actions: \"Who from Norfolk Southern was present? What were their roles? What specific damage did *you* personally observe on the car? What were the exact steps *you* took next?\"",
  "chunk_0-2": "On redirect, I will focus on the witness\u2019s critical qualifier, \u201cAt the time it was observed,\u201d to methodically break down the limitations of the data-gathering system itself\u2014specifically, the frequency of the readings and the unknown, unobserved status of the car in the intervals between them.",
  "chunk_0-3": "On redirect, have the witness walk through the precise, step-by-step operational sequence he initiated on the Trinity's 2025 console, using the system's specific terminology to replace the plaintiff's loaded term \"detonated\" with a factual description of the system's actual function.",
  "chunk_0-4": "Instruct the witness not to answer the pending question and state on the record that we will be clarifying what the witness meant by \"performed exactly as it was built to perform,\" as that vague statement oversimplifies the actual design specifications, failure tolerances, and performance limitations.",
  "chunk_0-5": "On redirect examination, I will deconstruct the witness's agreement by forcing them to define the term \"exactly as it should,\" breaking it down into the device's specific operational parameters and the witness's precise, personal knowledge of each function's performance relative to its design.",
  "chunk_0-6": "Before allowing any questioning on the document at page 85, I would ensure the witness's testimony is strictly confined to their precise, on-the-ground role and direct personal knowledge, forcing counsel to establish proper foundation and preventing my witness from speculating on high-level corporate decisions like the ultimate rationale for not re-railing the car.",
  "chunk_0-7": "On redirect, I will break down the \"derailment response\" into its component parts to clarify that the witness's \"No\" is based on Trinity's limited, specific role within that system, not a blanket approval of the entire operation."
