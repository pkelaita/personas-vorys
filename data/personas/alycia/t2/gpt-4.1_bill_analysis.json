  "chunk_0-0": "My next move is to anchor the witness\u2019s agreement\u2014confirmed multiple times\u2014that there was no evidence of polymerization or BLEVE risk in TILX 2025, and that re-railing and forwarding the car was the plan. I would then immediately pivot to walk the witness, step by step and document by document, through the contemporaneous pressure and temperature readings, communications, and decision-tree documents to lock down this narrative and foreclose any later attempt by plaintiffs to reframe or reinterpret those readings or decisions as indicative of undisclosed risk or negligence. This establishes a clean, defensible factual record and eliminates the risk of later surprise.",
  "chunk_0-1": "Ask the witness to clarify the basis for their agreement with the statement\u2014specifically, \"Can you explain what facts or documents you are relying on when you say that's correct?\"\u2014to lock in their factual foundation and expose any gaps or assumptions in their knowledge.",
  "chunk_0-2": "I would immediately clarify the time frame and the basis for the witness\u2019s assessment of \"stability,\" pressing for specifics on **what data or observations were relied upon**, and then lock in the witness to exactly **when and how** they determined the car was \"stable,\" to prevent later revision or expansion of testimony.",
  "chunk_0-3": "Immediately press the witness to specify exactly *when* and *how* the temperature and pressure readings were taken, and confirm whether those readings were contemporaneous with the detonation event\u2014pin down the sequence and methodology with reference to the actual records to expose inconsistencies or gaps.",
  "chunk_0-4": "I would immediately focus on clarifying and locking down what the witness specifically means by \"performed exactly as it was built to perform in a derailment,\" probing for any caveats, exceptions, or deviations\u2014especially whether \"built to perform\" includes *all* expected safety outcomes, or merely the mechanical operation, and whether there were any unanticipated conditions or consequences despite the system functioning as designed.",
  "chunk_0-5": "Before responding further, I would immediately secure clarification and lay an unambiguous foundation regarding the definition of \"acted exactly as it should\"\u2014specifically what criteria, procedures, or technical standards the witness is relying on to make that assertion\u2014so as to preclude any later reinterpretation or broadening of the phrase by opposing counsel.",
  "chunk_0-6": "Immediately clarify the witness\u2019s understanding about the decision not to re-rail the car\u2014specifically, ask the witness to describe in detail *their* actual understanding of why the 2025 car was not re-railed, and what communications or observations they personally had regarding the car\u2019s condition at the scene. Pin down the factual basis (if any) for their disagreement with opposing counsel\u2019s stated reason (damaged bolster), and reference any contemporaneous records or communications they authored or received about this decision.",
  "chunk_0-7": "Before allowing the witness to answer further questions about Trinity\u2019s involvement, I would immediately focus on locking down the witness\u2019s basis of knowledge: **\u201cYou\u2019ve just stated you don\u2019t fault Trinity in the derailment response. Can you describe specifically what actions, communications, or decisions by Trinity you were aware of at the time, and how you became aware of them?\u201d** This ensures the witness is testifying from their own direct knowledge, not speculation, and helps prevent later impeachment if they claim ignorance of key facts."
