  "chunk_0-0": "My next move is to methodically \"scene paint\" the precise evaluation and decision-making process regarding the Trinity 2025 car: I would ask the witness to walk through, in granular detail, exactly who was involved, what specific temperature and pressure readings were referenced, where those readings were logged or accessed (by document and device/system), and how\u2014and when\u2014those readings were interpreted as eliminating polymerization/bleve risk, to clarify the objective basis for those safety decisions and expose any gaps, inconsistencies, or unrecorded assumptions in the contemporaneous record.",
  "chunk_0-1": "I would focus next on meticulously establishing the *standard protocol and decision-making criteria* Norfolk Southern uses for re-railing after a derailment. I would ask the witness to describe, step by step and in granular detail, exactly how the decision to re-rail is made, who is involved, what information is reviewed, and whether there are written guidelines or checklists that govern the process. This sets the groundwork to pinpoint potential deviations, reveal any subjective or ad hoc decision-making, and identify specific documents or individuals for further corroboration.",
  "chunk_0-2": "Clarify and pin down the precise moment and conditions under which the witness observed Trinity\u2019s 2025 as \u201cstable,\u201d then systematically probe for any subsequent changes in monitoring, data, or environmental factors that could have rendered that stability assessment unreliable or outdated.",
  "chunk_0-3": "Ask the witness: \"Can you walk me, step by step, through exactly what you observed, heard, and did in the moments leading up to and immediately following the detonation in the vent\u2014starting from when you first arrived at the scene, so we fully understand your actions and decision-making process?\"",
  "chunk_0-4": "I would immediately focus on precisely mapping the \"system architecture\" of the device\u2014ask the witness to walk through, step by step, how the device's design and intended function are documented, who designed its emergency behavior, what engineering documentation or logs track this, and specifically where in the design or maintenance records the criteria for triggering in a derailment are reflected. This will lock down whether \"performed exactly as it was built\" is grounded in demonstrable fact or simply a conclusory assertion.",
  "chunk_0-5": "My next step is to immediately clarify **what the witness means by \"acted exactly as it should\"**\u2014specifically, to systematically break down the device's intended safety protocols and mechanical response during a derailment, and walk the witness through each function step-by-step, comparing those expectations to the actual, documented performance in this incident. This ensures the witness is anchored in objective, verifiable facts rather than a conclusory or potentially self-serving summary.",
  "chunk_0-6": "Re-anchor the witness in *fact-specific, sensory, and system-detail recall* regarding the decision not to re-rail Trinity\u2019s 2025 car:  \n\n**\u201cWalk me through exactly who inspected the 2025 car and what specifically was observed about the bolster\u2014what did you see, touch, or hear, and which systems or documentation captured those findings?\u201d**\n\nThis opens granular, scene-painting details, exposes true memory versus claimed ignorance, and ties systems knowledge directly to individual roles, setting up both credibility assessment and accountability tracing.",
  "chunk_0-7": "Ask the witness to describe, in granular detail, exactly what Trinity did do during the derailment response\u2014step-by-step and including any communications, personnel mobilized, and resources offered or provided\u2014so as to \u201cpaint the scene\u201d and test the completeness and accuracy of their claim of \u201cno fault.\u201d"
