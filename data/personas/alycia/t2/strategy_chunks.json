The pressure and temperature\nreadings that you received from the TILX 2025\ncar were in no way indicative of a potential\nBLEVE.\nWere they, sir?\nMS. PETTY: Objection.\nTHE WITNESS: No.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:\nQ.   They were not, right?\nMS. PETTY: Objection.\nTHE WITNESS: That's correct.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:\nQ.   And you know, based on the\npressure and temperature readings of\nTrinity's 2025, that Norfolk Southern and its\ncontractors believed the car was a candidate\nfor re-railing.\nRight?\nMS. PETTY: Objection.\nTHE WITNESS: That was part of\nthe decision tree, and, yes,\noriginally we did believe that.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:\nQ.   Right.\nWhat you wanted to do with the\nTrinity car, 2025, was put it back on the\ntracks and send it on its way.\nRight, sir?\nMS. PETTY: Objection.\nTHE WITNESS: That's correct.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:\nQ.   And I'm going to give Norfolk\nSouthern the benefit of the doubt that you\nwouldn't have contemplated doing that if you\nthought there was any risk of polymerization.",
  "Right, sir?\nMS. PETTY: Objection.\nTHE WITNESS: That's correct.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:\nQ.   Norfolk Southern wouldn't have\nconsidered re-railing Trinity's 2025 if it",
  "believed there was any concern about a\npotential BLEVE.\nRight?\nA.   That's correct.\nQ.   What you know, based on the\npressure and temperature readings of\nTrinity's 2025, was that that car was stable.\nWasn't it, sir?\nMS. PETTY: Objection.\nTHE WITNESS: At the time it\nwas observed, that's correct.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:\nQ.   That car was stable right up to",

  "the reason Norfolk Southern didn't re-rail\nTrinity's 2025 car was because of a damaged\nbolster.\nIs that your understanding?\nMS. PETTY: Objection.\nTHE WITNESS: No.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:\nQ.   Okay. Let's turn, if we could,\nto page 85 of 158.\nA.   Yes.\nthe derailment default anything Trinity did\nor did not do in assisting with the\nderailment response?\nMS. PETTY: Objection.\nTHE WITNESS: I'm sorry, I\ndidn't understand.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:\nQ.   As the person on the ground - 9 as a person on the ground for Norfolk\nSouthern who was helping -- I can't read that\nnow. Let me try it again.\nAll right. As a Norfolk\nSouthern employee who was on the ground\nhelping to manage the response to the",
  "derailment, do you fault anything that\nTrinity did or didn't do in assisting with\nthe derailment response?\nA.   No.\nQ.   Was Trinity consulted in any\nway before Norfolk Southern made the decision"
