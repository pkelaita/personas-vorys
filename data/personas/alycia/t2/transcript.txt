 1 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:
 2    Q.   You have no way to indicate
 3 that polymerization was occurring in the
 4 Trinity car.
 5        Right, sir?
 6        MS. PETTY: Objection.
 7        THE WITNESS: Correct.
 8 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:
 9    Q.   The pressure and temperature
10 readings that you received from the TILX 2025
11 car were in no way indicative of a potential
12 BLEVE.
13        Were they, sir?
14        MS. PETTY: Objection.
15        THE WITNESS: No.
16 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:
17    Q.   They were not, right?
18        MS. PETTY: Objection.
19        THE WITNESS: That's correct.
20 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:
21    Q.   And you know, based on the
22 pressure and temperature readings of
23 Trinity's 2025, that Norfolk Southern and its
24 contractors believed the car was a candidate
25 for re-railing.

```

```
 1        Right?
 2        MS. PETTY: Objection.
 3        THE WITNESS: That was part of
 4    the decision tree, and, yes,
 5    originally we did believe that.
 6 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:
 7    Q.   Right.
 8        What you wanted to do with the
 9 Trinity car, 2025, was put it back on the
10 tracks and send it on its way.
11        Right, sir?
12        MS. PETTY: Objection.
13        THE WITNESS: That's correct.
14 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:
15    Q.   And I'm going to give Norfolk
16 Southern the benefit of the doubt that you
17 wouldn't have contemplated doing that if you
18 thought there was any risk of polymerization.
19        Right, sir?
20        MS. PETTY: Objection.
21        THE WITNESS: That's correct.
22 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:
23    Q.   Norfolk Southern wouldn't have
24 considered re-railing Trinity's 2025 if it
25 believed there was any concern about a

```

-----

```
 1 potential BLEVE.
 2        Right?
 3    A.   That's correct.
 4    Q.   What you know, based on the
 5 pressure and temperature readings of
 6 Trinity's 2025, was that that car was stable.
 7        Wasn't it, sir?
 8        MS. PETTY: Objection.
 9        THE WITNESS: At the time it
10    was observed, that's correct.
11 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:
12    Q.   That car was stable right up to
13 the moment that you detonated it in the vent
14 and burn.
15        Wasn't it, sir?
16        MS. PETTY: Objection.
17        THE WITNESS: That's correct.
18 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:
19    Q.   What you know, based on the
20 temperature and pressure readings that you
21 took from Trinity's 2025, was that that car
22 performed exactly as it was built to perform
23 in a derailment.
24        Didn't it, sir?
25        MS. PETTY: Objection.

```

```
 1        MR. FUKUMURA: Objection.
 2        THE WITNESS: That's correct.
 3 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:
 4    Q.   And what you know from those
 5 pressure and temperature readings
 6 specifically is that the pressure release
 7 device on 2025 acted exactly as it should in
 8 a derailment.
 9        Correct?
10        MS. PETTY: Objection.
11        MR. FUKUMURA: Objection.
12        THE WITNESS: That's correct.
13 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:
14    Q.   Now, I've seen evidence in the
15 factual report we've been talking about that
16 the reason Norfolk Southern didn't re-rail
17 Trinity's 2025 car was because of a damaged
18 bolster.
19        Is that your understanding?
20        MS. PETTY: Objection.
21        THE WITNESS: No.
22 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:
23    Q.   Okay. Let's turn, if we could,
24 to page 85 of 158.
25    A.   Yes.

 1 the derailment default anything Trinity did
 2 or did not do in assisting with the
 3 derailment response?
 4        MS. PETTY: Objection.
 5        THE WITNESS: I'm sorry, I
 6    didn't understand.
 7 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:
 8    Q.   As the person on the ground - 9 as a person on the ground for Norfolk
10 Southern who was helping -- I can't read that
11 now. Let me try it again.
12        All right. As a Norfolk
13 Southern employee who was on the ground
14 helping to manage the response to the
15 derailment, do you fault anything that
16 Trinity did or didn't do in assisting with
17 the derailment response?
18    A.   No.
19    Q.   Was Trinity consulted in any
20 way before Norfolk Southern made the decision
21 to vent and burn 2025?
22        MS. PETTY: Objection.
23        THE WITNESS: Not to my
24    knowledge.
