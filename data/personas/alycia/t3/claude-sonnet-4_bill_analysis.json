What specific preparation he undertook for each noticed topic\n2. Who he spoke with and what documents he reviewed \n3. Whether he has any operational knowledge of the derailment incident itself\n4. What his actual knowledge limitations are for the technical/operational topics he's been designated to address\n\nThis is critical because if Norfolk Southern has designated someone who lacks adequate knowledge or preparation on key topics, it creates immediate strategic leverage - either forcing them to produce better-prepared witnesses later or establishing that their corporate designee testimony is inadequate. The \"three weeks\" timeline suggests potentially rushed preparation that needs to be exposed early and comprehensively.",
  "chunk_0-1": "Based on the transcript, the deponent (Neikirk) has just been questioned about Norfolk Southern's voluntary $500,000 economic development grant following the East Palestine derailment. The most critical strategic move is:\n\n**Immediately explore the scope and limitations of what constitutes \"voluntary\" versus legally required expenditures across all remediation and community assistance efforts.**\n\nThis line of questioning should establish whether Norfolk Southern is characterizing legally mandated or settlement-driven expenditures as \"voluntary\" community assistance, which could be crucial for damages calculations and Norfolk Southern's narrative of corporate responsibility versus legal obligation. The witness has already acknowledged general familiarity with community assistance efforts, making this the optimal moment to pin down the true nature of these expenditures before moving to other topics.",

My next strategic move would be to use follow-up questions to establish that while the witness may not have reviewed \"the list,\" they likely have substantive knowledge about the grant itself, its purpose, and Norfolk Southern's actual damages position - thereby undermining the implication that the witness is wholly unprepared on material issues.\n\nThis approach follows my principle of \"knowing where your soft spots are\" and immediately addressing apparent weaknesses before they can be exploited further.",

Whether the witness is aware of any regulatory order, consent decree, or legal mandate requiring this specific spending\n3. The timing of when this pledge was made relative to any legal proceedings or regulatory actions\n\nThis line of questioning could reveal either that Norfolk Southern is claiming damages for expenditures they were legally required to make (undermining their damage claims) or expose the witness's lack of knowledge about fundamental aspects of their own company's response strategy.",

The timing and true motivation behind this commitment could be crucial - if it was made after litigation commenced or regulatory pressure mounted, it undermines the \"voluntary\" characterization and suggests consciousness of liability. The documents showing the real decision-making process will likely reveal whether this was truly voluntary or reactive damage control.",

I would focus on establishing whether this $103 million represents: (1) voluntary community aid/remediation costs, (2) regulatory compliance expenses, (3) actual legal damages being claimed, or (4) some combination. This distinction is crucial because voluntary commitments don't automatically translate to recoverable damages against third parties, and the witness needs to clarify what specific categories of costs Norfolk Southern is actually seeking to recover in this litigation versus what they've committed to spend regardless of this case's outcome.",

Ask specifically: \"What documents did you review to become familiar with that total number?\" and \"Who prepared the analysis that determined this $652 million amount?\" \n\nThe witness has admitted familiarity with a significant financial figure but claims it's not broken down in their prepared remarks - this gap between knowledge and preparation suggests there are key supporting documents that haven't been disclosed, and those documents likely contain the detailed breakdown that could reveal vulnerabilities in their damage calculations.",
  "chunk_0-55": "**Focus immediately on obtaining and examining the \"remarks\" document the witness referenced earlier.** \n\nThis witness just acknowledged a critical financial disclosure showing $836 million in expenses with only $517 million paid, leaving a $319 million gap. The witness mentioned having \"remarks\" that may contain the breakdown of these figures. You need to get that document produced immediately and examine whether it contains admissions, inconsistencies, or additional damaging financial information that wasn't disclosed in the formal filings. This could be the smoking gun that explains the unpaid obligations and potential financial misstatements.",
  "chunk_0-56": "Focus immediately on the breakdown of the $116 million loss figure. The deponent admits familiarity with the total but claims no knowledge of its breakdown, yet they were prepared to break down the $517 million figure. This inconsistency suggests either selective preparation or potential knowledge they're not revealing. Press for what specific components they DO know within that $116 million, who would have that breakdown, and whether any portion relates to third-party claims - this could reveal damages calculations or settlement strategies that directly impact the case.",
  "chunk_0-57": "**Focus on preparation scope and limitations.** Ask specifically: \"What documents did you review to prepare for this testimony, and were there any topics or document categories you were told NOT to review or that were considered outside your preparation scope?\" This targets the breadth of his preparation and potentially reveals strategic decisions by opposing counsel about what they wanted him to know or not know, which could expose gaps in his knowledge or areas where they're vulnerable.",
  "chunk_0-58": "**Focus immediately on the privilege objection.**\n\nThe opposing counsel just made a privilege objection, but the witness answered anyway and revealed they were told they'd be deposed about East Palestine. This suggests either: (1) the privilege claim is weak/improper, or (2) the witness just waived privilege by answering despite the objection.\n\n**Next move:** Press the witness to complete their interrupted answer about what additional details they were given, then circle back to establish exactly what privileged communications occurred and with whom. The privilege objection may have inadvertently opened a door to explore attorney-client communications that wouldn't normally be discoverable.\n\nThe witness was mid-sentence (\"It -- it was more to -- to the\") when the excerpt cuts off - that incomplete thought likely contains the most valuable information about their preparation or instructions.",
  "chunk_0-59": "**Next Strategic Move:** Immediately probe the preparation gap by asking: \"What documents did you review before coming here today?\" followed by \"Who, if anyone, discussed this deposition with you in the past week?\" \n\nThis witness appears unprepared and potentially coached to give minimal responses about their preparation. Their vague answers about not asking people to help \"directly\" and only having general knowledge about testifying on their complaint suggests either inadequate preparation or deliberate evasion. Getting them to admit they reviewed no documents or had no substantive preparation discussions will either expose their lack of credibility or force them to reveal the true extent of their coaching, both of which are advantageous.",
  "chunk_0-60": "I would immediately drill down on the specific nature and extent of the preparation with counsel. Ask: \"What specifically did you and counsel discuss about your testimony? Did counsel show you any documents? Did you review any materials together? How many preparation sessions did you have and for how long?\" \n\nThis witness just opened the door to potentially privileged communications, and I need to establish the boundaries of what was discussed while preserving any discoverable factual preparation that occurred. The witness may have inadvertently waived privilege or revealed coaching on testimony that could undermine their credibility.",
  "chunk_0-61": "**Immediately probe the substance of those preparation calls.** Ask specifically what topics were discussed, what documents were reviewed, what instructions or advice were given, and whether the witness was coached on how to answer certain questions. The witness just admitted to substantive preparation despite initially claiming no preparation - this contradiction opens the door to explore whether there was improper coaching or coordination that could undermine the witness's credibility and reveal the opposing side's case strategy.",
  "chunk_0-62": "**Immediately request production of the witness's calendar records for the relevant time period.**\n\nThe witness has just confirmed they maintain a calendar and that these calls \"probably are\" and \"would be\" documented in it. This creates a clear documentary trail that could either corroborate their testimony or reveal inconsistencies. As opposing counsel has established the existence and likely contents of this calendar, you need to secure this evidence before the deposition continues further, as it may contain critical details about timing, participants, or context that could significantly impact the witness's credibility or the substance of their testimony about these calls.",
  "chunk_0-63": "**Immediately request a break to retrieve the witness's computer/calendar and review it with the witness before continuing.**\n\nThe opposing counsel is clearly building toward calendar-based impeachment or fact development, and they've just established the witness keeps their own calendar on their computer in the other room. As Bill Kloss, I know that calendars are goldmines of factual detail that can either devastate or vindicate a witness's testimony about meetings, preparation time, and sequence of events. \n\nBefore allowing any further questioning about what the witness did or didn't do to prepare, I need to get that calendar in front of us to eliminate surprises and ensure the witness can testify accurately about dates, meetings, and preparation activities. The opposing counsel's \"Terrific\" response signals they're planning to use this calendar evidence - I need to control that narrative by reviewing it first.",
  "chunk_0-64": "Focus immediately on pinning down the specific timeline and sources of the witness's knowledge about the Norfolk Southern lawsuit against the Third-Party Defendants. The witness just admitted this wasn't the first time they heard about it, creating an opening to establish when they first learned of it, from whom, and what specific facts they knew before counsel's involvement - this could reveal critical early knowledge or involvement that contradicts their preparation narrative.",
  "chunk_0-65": "**Immediately demand to see and examine the detailed binder referenced by the witness.**\n\nThis is a classic document production gap that could contain the smoking gun. The witness just revealed a \"much more detailed\" binder that wasn't mentioned before and likely wasn't produced in discovery. As Kloss would say, you need to \"know your documents\" and \"eliminate surprise\" - this binder could fundamentally change the case's trajectory. Get it identified, marked, and examined now before the witness realizes the significance of what they've disclosed.",
  "chunk_0-66": "**Focus immediately on the timeline and source of the binder materials.** \n\nPin down exactly when the witness received the binder, from whom, and what instructions or explanations accompanied it. The witness just contradicted the implication that lawyers provided materials between calls, creating an opening to expose preparation gaps or inconsistencies in how the witness was coached. This could reveal either inadequate witness preparation by opposing counsel or potentially problematic ex parte communications that weren't properly disclosed.",
  "chunk_0-67": "**Next Strategic Move:**\n\nImmediately object to this line of questioning as seeking privileged attorney-client communications. The opposing counsel is trying to backdoor into privileged territory by asking about \"facts\" the lawyers provided between calls. This is a classic attempt to circumvent privilege protections by framing privileged communications as mere \"fact-sharing.\"\n\nI would state: \"Objection. This question seeks to elicit privileged attorney-client communications under the guise of asking about 'facts.' Any information shared between attorney and client, regardless of how it's characterized, is protected by privilege.\"\n\nThen instruct the witness not to answer and be prepared to argue that any \"facts\" shared by counsel to client are inherently part of the privileged relationship and strategic decision-making process.",
  "chunk_0-68": "Focus immediately on securing those yellow sticky notes through document production. This witness just admitted to creating contemporaneous notes about lawyer communications regarding the case, then tried to minimize their importance.

  "chunk_0-69": "**Immediately probe what specific preparation activities the witness undertook between calls, particularly any document gathering or data assembly efforts with subordinates.**\n\nThis witness just admitted they didn't know all the case details initially and learned more between calls. The follow-up question about asking reports to \"assemble items or get data\" suggests potential undisclosed preparation activities that could reveal: (1) additional witnesses with case knowledge, (2) documents that were compiled but may not have been produced, and (3) the scope of what the witness now knows versus what they're claiming ignorance about. This is a critical foundation-laying moment to lock down their preparation activities before testing their knowledge on substantive topics.",

PUJARI: Objection: form;\" which lacks the necessary context about the deposition proceedings, the nature of the case, the witness testimony, or the specific question that prompted the objection.\n\nTo provide meaningful strategic guidance consistent with Bill Kloss's thorough, fact-driven approach, I would need to see the actual questions, witness responses, and surrounding context that led to this objection.",
  "chunk_0-71": "Focus immediately on pinning down the exact participants and substance of this second call two weeks ago. The witness is being evasive about who was present and what was discussed. Demand specific details about what Nate Smith and the other in-house lawyers said during this call, as their statements could constitute admissions or reveal the company's legal strategy. Don't let the witness deflect with vague recollections - press for concrete details about the legal advice given and decisions made.",

Starting with the first call - what specific facts were you given, by whom, and in what order?\" Then methodically work through each call to create a detailed timeline of who said what when.\n\nThis approach follows Kloss's core principle of eliminating surprise by getting all the facts on the record now, while the witness is committed to \"three calls\" and before they can backtrack or become evasive about the content of those critical conversations.",

The witness is being evasive about what \"information about the incident, the cars involved, a few details\" actually means. \n\nAsk: \"What specifically did you learn about the incident that you didn't know before that second call?\" Then systematically go through each category - the incident details, the cars involved, and those \"few details\" - demanding concrete specifics rather than accepting these vague generalizations.\n\nThis witness has admitted receiving case facts but is clearly coached to avoid specificity. The preparation angle shows potential witness coaching, but more importantly, nailing down exactly what facts they received will either expose gaps in their knowledge or reveal they know more than they should for their claimed role in this matter.",
  "chunk_0-74": "Based on this brief excerpt, I would focus on **immediately clarifying what specific \"facts\" were allegedly given to the deponent and by whom.** \n\nThe questioning appears to be laying groundwork to establish the deponent as a passive recipient of information rather than an active decision-maker. I need to pin down the exact nature of these \"facts\" - were they opinions, recommendations, data, or conclusions? Who provided them and in what context? This specificity will either undermine the opposing counsel's attempt to characterize my client as merely absorbing information, or help me understand what damaging admissions they're building toward so I can address them head-on.\n\nThe vague \"folks were giving you facts\" phrasing is a red flag that needs immediate clarification before it becomes accepted as established fact in the record.",

I need to expose the gaps in their firsthand knowledge and create doubt about the reliability of their testimony by forcing them to distinguish between what they actually know versus what they were told - then attack the credibility of those secondary sources.",
  "chunk_0-76": "**Immediately object to form and foundation, then instruct the witness not to answer questions about attorney work product.**\n\nThe opposing counsel is clearly attempting to pierce attorney-client privilege and work product protection by characterizing the witness's preparation notes as \"prepared for you by the lawyer.\" This is a critical moment where defending counsel must protect privileged communications and work product. Any admission here could waive privilege and expose the entire preparation process to discovery.\n\nThe strategic move is to shut down this line of inquiry immediately before any damaging admissions are made about the nature, content, or source of the preparation materials.",
  "chunk_0-77": "Focus immediately on getting the witness to identify with specificity which sections, pages, or line items each person (the witness, Kristin Hoffman, and Will Harden) was responsible for preparing. This will lock down attribution of specific data and calculations, potentially revealing inconsistencies, gaps in knowledge, or areas where the witness lacks personal knowledge that could be exploited later in the deposition or at trial.",
  "chunk_0-78": "Focus immediately on the verification and accuracy of these specific dollar figures from both sources. Since you've identified that Hoffman provided the $836 million environmental response cost figure and Harden provided the $103 million community funds figure, your next critical move should be to pin down exactly what documentation supported these numbers when they were provided to the deponent.\n\nAsk specifically: \"What documents did Kristin Hoffman show you or reference when she gave you the $836 million figure?\" and \"What backup materials or records did Will Harden provide to support the $103 million in community commitments?\" \n\nThis will either reveal the underlying documentation that validates these figures or expose that they were provided without proper substantiation - both scenarios are strategically valuable for understanding the reliability of the information and the deponent's reliance on it.",
  "chunk_0-79": "I need to immediately shift focus to pin down the legal basis for what constitutes \"voluntary\" versus legally mandated expenditures. The witness is being led into characterizing massive financial outlays as \"voluntary\" without any foundational understanding of Norfolk Southern's legal obligations.\n\n**Next strategic move:** Establish the witness's knowledge of any legal requirements, regulatory mandates, settlement agreements, or consent decrees that may have compelled these expenditures. Ask: \"Before we continue characterizing these payments as voluntary, what legal obligations, if any, did Norfolk Southern have to make payments to East Palestine residents following the derailment?\" Follow up with specific questions about EPA orders, state regulatory requirements, and any settlement discussions that preceded these payments.\n\nThis foundation is critical because opposing counsel is building a narrative of corporate benevolence when these may actually be legally compelled remediation costs disguised as voluntary acts.",
  "chunk_0-80": "**Next Strategic Move:** Immediately follow up with: \"What would you need to review or what information would you need to be prepared to testify about whether this action was voluntary or involuntary?\" \n\nThis witness just revealed uncertainty about a potentially critical factual distinction. Rather than letting opposing counsel move on, I need to pin down exactly what the witness knows, what they don't know, and what documents or information might clarify this key point.

You need to lock down the document's provenance and establish whether this was a collaborative attorney work product or the witness's independent analysis - this will dictate privilege issues and authenticity challenges going forward.",
  "chunk_0-82": "Based on this brief excerpt, I would focus on **pinning down the specific timing and participants of the document review call**. \n\nThe witness has admitted to reviewing something, but there's ambiguity about which call this occurred during. I'd immediately follow up with:\n\n\"Let's be precise - how many calls were there where documents were reviewed? Let's go through each one chronologically and identify exactly what was reviewed in each call and who participated.\"\n\nThis establishes a factual foundation that prevents the witness from later conflating different calls or changing their testimony about what was discussed when. The form objection suggests opposing counsel is uncomfortable with the questioning, which makes locking down these specifics even more critical before proceeding.",
  "chunk_0-83": "**Focus immediately on obtaining and examining the prior version of the document that the witness has with them.**\n\nThis is a classic Kloss moment - the witness just revealed they have an earlier version of a key document that underwent changes between preparation calls, and they're being evasive about the timing and nature of those changes. The fact that they brought the prior version to the deposition but it hasn't been produced yet represents a critical factual gap that could expose inconsistencies or reveal the evolution of their testimony preparation.

The witness has just admitted they didn't write key testimony language and is being evasive about whether lawyers wrote it \"for\" them.\n\nThis opens the door to expose potential witness preparation issues and question the authenticity of the corporate designee's knowledge versus coached responses - a critical credibility attack that could undermine their entire testimony.",
  "chunk_0-86": "**Focus immediately on establishing a clear record of the obstruction and the specific factual basis being concealed.**\n\nSince opposing counsel is instructing the witness not to answer regarding how he obtained facts for a specific bullet point, I would:\n\n1. **Demand a specific privilege basis on the record** - \"Counsel, state the specific legal basis for your instruction not to answer\"\n2. **Pin down exactly what's being protected** - \"Are you claiming attorney-client privilege, work product, or some other basis for this bullet point about factual information?\"\n3. **Establish the prejudice** - Make clear this appears to be factual information, not legal advice, and the instruction is improper\n\nThis obstruction suggests they're hiding something significant about how key facts were developed or discovered.

I need you to state the specific legal basis for this instruction - privilege, work product, or other grounds - before we proceed to any other topic.\"\n\nThis forces opposing counsel to commit to a legal position that can be challenged later, prevents them from using vague instructions as a delay tactic, and preserves my right to seek court intervention on any improper objections.

This pattern suggests either the witness was deliberately kept in the dark about these significant financial details or failed to exercise reasonable oversight. I would establish this as a foundation for either challenging the witness's credibility regarding their knowledge of other key facts or demonstrating institutional problems with Norfolk Southern's internal communication and oversight processes.\n\nThis line of questioning sets up a powerful narrative that the witness (and potentially the organization) either doesn't want to know inconvenient details or operates with insufficient oversight of significant financial decisions related to the derailment response.",

Their repeated hedging (\"I think it may have come up,\" \"may have been shared,\" \"something like Exhibit 6\") suggests either poor recollection or deliberate vagueness about a key document discussion.\n\nI would immediately request production of: (1) any documents shared or referenced during that February 26th Teams meeting, (2) the meeting recording if it exists, and (3) any follow-up communications referencing documents discussed. Then I would pin down exactly what document the witness reviewed, when they first saw it, and what differences existed between versions - because the witness's uncertainty about whether they saw the actual Exhibit 6 or a \"slightly different\" version could reveal document alterations or multiple versions that weren't produced.",

If they're testifying outside their expertise about critical causation issues, you need to establish whether they're speculating, relying on hearsay, or have actual foundation for these admissions.
