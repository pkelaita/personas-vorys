  "chunk_0-1": "Object to the form of the questioning. Counsel is improperly asking about the witness's personal familiarity with a public-relations document rather than the corporation's knowledge of the underlying facts of the designated topics, for which he is prepared. I will instruct the witness to answer questions regarding the facts of the remediation costs themselves, based on his preparation as the corporate representative.",
  "chunk_0-2": "Object that the question is argumentative, has been asked and answered, and continues to call for a legal conclusion. Instruct the witness not to answer a question regarding the legal theories of the case, as that is the province of counsel and is laid out in our pleadings.",
  "chunk_0-3": "Object that the question is argumentative and assumes facts not in evidence regarding the scope of preparation. I will clarify on the record that this witness was not designated to testify on the legal composition of our damages claim and instruct him to answer only what he did to prepare for his designated topics.",

  "chunk_0-6": "Instruct the witness not to answer. The question is improper as it asks a non-designated witness to testify about the adequacy of their own preparation for a topic they were never designated to cover; this is a harassing tactic designed to manufacture a discovery dispute through the witness.",
