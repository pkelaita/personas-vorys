  "chunk_0-1": "Object to the question as calling for a legal conclusion and instruct the witness to confine his testimony to the facts he was prepared on for Topic 12\u2014the costs Norfolk Southern has incurred\u2014and not to speculate on the legal or motivational characterization of any specific cost based on a public relations document he did not review in preparation for this testimony.",
  "chunk_0-2": "Object that the question has been asked and answered and instruct the witness not to answer again; counsel is simply rephrasing a question the witness has already testified he cannot answer.",
  "chunk_0-3": "Take a break to instruct my witness to answer the pending question narrowly and truthfully by stating exactly what they *did* do to prepare, and to clarify that the specific legal and financial calculation of damages sought in the litigation was outside the scope of their designated testimony.",
  "chunk_0-4": "Instruct the witness not to answer questions regarding their specific preparation for the deposition, as it implicates attorney-client privilege and work product, and then direct opposing counsel to ask a proper, substantive question about what the witness knows regarding the grant itself.",
  "chunk_0-5": "On my turn to question the witness, I would immediately focus on establishing the precise limits of their role and knowledge to neutralize the damage from their \"I don't know\" answers. My questioning would be: \"Is it part of your specific job responsibility to determine which corporate expenditures qualify as recoverable damages in litigation? Are you the person at Norfolk Southern who prepared the damages claim against the Third-Party Defendants in this case?\"",
  "chunk_0-6": "Instruct my witness to answer the pending question by stating, \"Correct, I did not prepare to testify on damages, as that was not a topic for which I was designated.\"",
  "chunk_0-7": "On redirect, I will establish the full genesis of the First Responder Training Center, focusing on who was involved in the decision-making and when discussions first began, to reframe the action as a collaborative community project rather than a unilateral admission of responsibility.",
  "chunk_0-8": "Instruct the witness not to answer. The question calls for a legal conclusion regarding the composition of our damages claim, which is defined by the pleadings and discovery responses, not this witness's testimony.",
  "chunk_0-9": "Take a break immediately. Confer with the witness to determine why they are unprepared on a key component of our damages claim and ensure they are ready to testify accurately about whether the training center costs are part of this case, preventing them from creating a fatal admission on the record.",
  "chunk_0-10": "Establish through questioning on redirect that the phrase \"initial intensive phase\" is an undefined label from Exhibit 3\u2014a document the witness did not author\u2014and is not a term the witness personally used or can define.",
  "chunk_0-11": "Instruct the witness not to answer on the grounds that the question calls for a legal conclusion and improperly asks him to characterize the claims and damages detailed in the pleadings, which are the proper source for that information.",
  "chunk_0-12": "On redirect, I will establish that Exhibit 3 is a high-level summary, not a detailed accounting document, and have the witness confirm they cannot testify as to the specific components of the damages claim without the actual financial records.",
  "chunk_0-13": "Object on the grounds of attorney-client privilege and work product, and instruct the witness not to answer questions regarding their preparation with counsel for this deposition.",
  "chunk_0-14": "Instruct the witness not to answer on the grounds that the question calls for a legal conclusion. The company's damages are defined by our formal disclosures and expert reports, not by this witness's interpretation of a public relations brochure.",
  "chunk_0-15": "Object and state for the record, \"Counsel, you're asking a witness who just testified he doesn't know the costs of the plan whether those unknown costs are part of our damages claim. If you want to know what's in our damages claim, you can ask our damages expert or serve an interrogatory, but you can't bootstrap it through a fact witness who has no knowledge of the underlying numbers.\"",
  "chunk_0-16": "After the objection, I would instruct the witness: \"You can answer only if you have personal knowledge regarding the specific accounting breakdown of this public-facing number and its direct correlation to the legal claims for damages filed in this case. Do not guess or speculate.\"",
  "chunk_0-17": "Instruct the witness not to answer. The question regarding preparation for a topic is derivative of the topic itself; since the underlying subject of third-party damages is beyond the scope of the 30(b)(6) notice, any questions about the witness's preparation for it are also improper.",
  "chunk_0-18": "Take a break at the earliest appropriate moment to confer with the witness. I must immediately ascertain whether the $300,000 payment is, in fact, included in our damages claim and then prepare the witness to testify accurately, neutralizing the apparent contradiction between a public \"accomplishment\" and a legal demand for recovery.",
  "chunk_0-19": "Object to the question as compound and instruct the witness to address each highlighted item separately, detailing the specific requests, directives, or consultations with governmental agencies (like the EPA or Ohio officials) that prompted each action, thereby dismantling the \"voluntary\" premise.",
  "chunk_0-20": "Take a break at the earliest opportunity to instruct the witness to stop using the word \"voluntary\" and instead testify only to the factual circumstances he knows regarding the authorization for each payment, such as who made the decision and when.",
  "chunk_0-21": "During the next break, instruct the witness to stop accepting the \"voluntary\" characterization and instead testify to the facts: that the aid was provided in response to and in discussion with various government agencies and community leaders.",
  "chunk_0-22": "Establish the full context behind this \"voluntary\" commitment by questioning the witness on all communications with federal, state, and local officials that preceded the decision, forcing an admission that the action was taken under significant external and regulatory pressure.",
  "chunk_0-23": "During the next break, instruct the witness to stop adopting counsel's label \"voluntary.\" Coach them to only describe the facts they know about the purpose of the payments (e.g., \"That was part of our community assistance program\" or \"That was a fund to provide immediate aid to residents\") and to state \"I don't know\" or \"That's not my term\" if they cannot factually characterize the action without speculation.",
  "chunk_0-24": "Instruct the witness not to adopt the characterization \"voluntarily\" and to instead testify only as to whether the actions were taken pursuant to a specific government order, regulatory directive, or pre-existing emergency response plan.",
  "chunk_0-25": "Take a break to confer with my client, instruct them not to adopt opposing counsel's damaging characterization of being \"unprepared,\" and coach them to answer narrowly that while they haven't memorized that specific breakdown, they can testify as to what they *do* know about the number.",
  "chunk_0-26": "Have the witness correct the premise of the question by identifying the document's true origin and tying it to their own work or standard business records, such as, \"This is a summary I prepared from the accounting ledgers,\" thereby refuting the implication it's a lawyer-created script.",
  "chunk_0-27": "On redirect, I will have the witness explain precisely why the number on his prep sheet only \"reconciles very close to\" the $9.1 million on Exhibit 3, forcing him to detail the specific components that create the difference and breaking the false equivalency my opponent is trying to create.",
  "chunk_0-28": "During the next break, I would instruct my witness to stop speculating or adopting opposing counsel's characterizations like \"voluntary,\" and to testify only about the specific facts they personally know regarding the decision-making process to open the centers.",
  "chunk_0-29": "Object to the question as compound and calling for speculation. Instruct the witness not to guess, and to clarify that they cannot connect a figure from a public-facing document they do not have in front of them to the specific components of the formal damages claim unless they have direct personal knowledge of that exact calculation.",
  "chunk_0-30": "Focus the next line of questioning on the specific document, order, or agreement that governs the creation of the $4.3 million fund to precisely define the context and legal obligations, rather than allowing opposing counsel to characterize the action with the ambiguous and loaded term \"voluntarily.\"",
  "chunk_0-31": "Instruct the witness not to answer. The question calls for a legal conclusion regarding the company's damage claims, a subject for which this witness has not been designated and has no personal knowledge.",
  "chunk_0-32": "Force opposing counsel to define what specific costs he means by the vague phrase \"returning aquatic life\" and to identify where, if anywhere, that specific work is documented on the witness's list before allowing my witness to answer.",
  "chunk_0-33": "Take a break immediately to confer with the witness. I need to understand exactly what they meant by \"I don't know if that is voluntary\" before opposing counsel can use that undefined and potentially damaging ambiguity to box them in on the recoverability of our damages.",
  "chunk_0-34": "Take a break to confer with the witness, ensuring they distinguish between familiarity with the document versus the \"effort\" itself, and instructing them to answer based only on their direct, personal knowledge.",
  "chunk_0-35": "On redirect, I will have the witness identify the specific document where they originally saw the $500,000 figure, demonstrating that the number is grounded in the record, just not on the specific \"list\" opposing counsel cherry-picked for this exchange.",
  "chunk_0-36": "On redirect, I would establish that the pamphlet is a high-level, public-facing summary and is distinct from the formal, itemized schedule of damages Norfolk Southern is seeking in this litigation, thereby clarifying why the witness could not adopt its contents wholesale as our legal claim.",
  "chunk_0-37": "Instruct the witness not to answer. The question improperly asks a fact witness to state a legal conclusion about the company's litigation and damages strategy, a topic for which he has already stated he is not prepared and which is outside the scope of his personal knowledge.",
  "chunk_0-38": "I would take a break, instruct my witness that any questions about what is \"right\" or \"wrong\" are improper and should be answered with \"That calls for a legal or ethical conclusion that I'm not qualified to make,\" and then state on the record that counsel must ground his questions in specific facts and documents, not vague hypotheticals about community perception.",
  "chunk_0-39": "At the next break, I would find out precisely what preparation document the witness used to recall the specific breakdown for the $699 million, because his perfect recall on that number makes his professed ignorance of the $137 million breakdown completely unbelievable and exposes him to a significant credibility attack.",
