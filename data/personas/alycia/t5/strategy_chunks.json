KNIGHT:\nQ Good morning, Mrs. Stegmann.\nA Good morning.\nQ My name is Jonathan Knight, and I'm joined\nby my co-counsel Sarah Maciel. We're attorneys\nrepresenting Norfolk Southern, and we just want to\nask you some questions about Oxy and the\nderailment in East Palestine, Ohio.\nWe've been given four hours to ask\nquestions and we may not use all of that time, but",
  "if there is unused time we may cede some of that\ntime to the other attorneys in case they have some\nadditional questions.\nDoes that make sense?\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 9\nA Yes.\nQ Okay. So with that, can you please state\nand spell your name for the record?\nA Yes, my name is Karenanne Stegmann.\nK-a-r-e-n-a-n-n-e, and Stegmann is\nS-t-e-g-m-a-n-n.\nQ Ms. Stegmann, have you heard of the\ncompany Norfolk Southern before?\nA Yes.\nQ And does Norfolk Southern have a business\nrelationship with Oxy Vinyls?\nA Yes.\nQ And what is that relationship?\nA They are a shipper and we -- or, I'm\nsorry, they are a rail carrier, and we are a\ncustomer of Norfolk Southern.\nQ And do you understand that we want to ask\nyou questions relating to the derailment of\nNorfolk, Southern Train 32N in East Palestine,\nOhio, on February 3rd, 2023?\nA Yes.\nQ And unless I say otherwise, you understand\nwhen I say \"derailment,\" that I'm referring to\nthat derailment of the Norfolk Southern Train 32N?\nA Yes.\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 10\nQ Have you ever testified in a lawsuit\nbefore?\nA Yes.\nQ Could you at a high level give me a\ndescription of what the subject matter of the\nlawsuit was?\nA It was an employee termination about -- a\nlittle over 20 years ago.\nQ Thank you. And is this your first time\nbeing deposed?\nA No.\nQ So as you know, I'm going to be asking you\na series of questions today, and after I finish my\nquestion, I will stop and give you an opportunity\nfor your -- for your attorney to object and for\nyou to answer the question.\nDoes that make sense?\nA Yes.\nQ And in response to my questions, will you\ngive me a verbal answer, you know, rather than\njust a nod or a gesture so it can be on the\nwritten record?\nA Yes, I will.\nQ Great. And if at any time you don't hear\nmy question or don't understand my question,\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 11\nplease let me know, okay?\nA Yes.\nQ And if at any time you need a break,\nplease let me know. This is not a test in\nendurance, happy to stop it, take a -- take a few\nminutes at any time that -- that you would like\nto.\nA Okay, thank you.",
  "Q And during the deposition today, there may\nbe objections from other attorneys in the room.\nYou still will need to answer the question. Those\nobjections are for a court to -- to take a look at\nand decide about at a later time.\nDoes that make sense?\nA I want to be clear. So if there is an\nobjection, I still answer the question?\nQ Correct.\nMS. BROZ: Unless I instruct her not to.\nMR. KNIGHT: Yes, exactly.",
  "Q Unless you're instructed not to answer the\nquestion, you will agree to answer all of my\nquestions, correct?\nA Okay, yes, I understand that process.\nQ Did you do anything to prepare for your\ndeposition today?\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 12\nA Yes.\nQ And tell me what you did.\nA I met with Stacy and Alycia yesterday at\nour office building and just reviewed some emails.\nQ And where was that office?\nA It's on the Tollway. It's our Dallas\nchemical office where I report to daily.\nQ Understood. And in that meeting did you\nmeet with anyone other than the people you've\nnamed?\nA No.\nQ Did you do anything else to prepare for\nthis deposition today?\nA No.\nQ And how long did that meeting with your\nattorneys yesterday last?\nA Approximately five hours including lunch.\nQ Did you look at any documents while you\nwere meeting with your lawyers yesterday?\nA Yes.\nQ And about how many documents would you\nsay?\nA Approximately 20, from my recollection.\nQ And without identifying the specific\ndocuments, could you describe generally what types\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 13\nof documents you looked at?\nA We -- they provided me my transcript from\nthe hearing in East Palestine in June of 2023. I\nalso reviewed some emails that I received the day\nof the -- or the following day of the derailment,\nand just some email correspondence that I was on.\nSo it was generally emails, my transcript,\nand we may have reviewed or just referenced the\nNTSB investigation. And I know that there was a\nletter because I am a party representative on the\nNTSB investigation.\nQ And when you're referring to the\ntranscript, you're referring to the transcript of\nthe NTSB hearing?\nA Yes, sir.\nQ And that was the NTSB hearing conducted in\nrelation to the derailment of Train 32N, correct?\nA Correct.\nQ And you stated that you reviewed some\nemails, correct?\nA Yes.\nQ And those were emails that you received\nthe day of or the day after the derailment?\nA I don't remember all the date references,\nso it may have been long -- different than just\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 14\nthose days.\nQ Okay. And about how many emails would you\nsay that you reviewed?\nA I think I said previously a total of\napproximately 20 documents.\nQ Okay. So less than 20?\nYes or no? I'm just -- if you could just\nanswer?\nA Yes, one less -- again, I estimated 20\ndocuments in total including the transcript.\nQ Okay. And so you were sworn in by the\ncourt reporter, and you understand that you are\nunder oath today, correct?\nA Yes, I do.\nQ And is there any reason that you can't\nprovide your most complete and accurate testimony\ntoday?\nA No, I can complete my complete and\naccurate testimony. I just want to reiterate that\nI am a party representative in the NTSB hearing,\nand I signed an agreement stating that certain\nfacts that are part of the hearing that have not\nbeen released, I cannot share.\nQ And could you generally describe the types\nof facts that you agreed not to share as part of\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 15\nan agreement you signed with the NTSB?\nA Facts that are learned through the\ninvestigative process.\nQ Understood. So we'll come to the -- the\ndiscussion about and questions about the NTSB\nhearing process, and I guess we'll cross that\nbridge when we get to it.\nBefore we get to that, I want to just ask\nyou some -- some questions about your -- about\nyour background and your role at Oxy Vinyls.\nSo, Ms. Stegmann, by whom are you\ncurrently employed?\nA I'm currently employed by Occidental\nChemical Corporation.\nQ And I'm glad that you -- you've stated\nthat you're employed by Occidental Chemical\nCorporation, because I've actually heard several\nentities that seem to -- seem to fall under the\nname \"Oxy.\" So I just want to make sure and I\nhope you can help me understand how they relate to\neach other.\nSo I've heard of OxyChem and I've heard of\nOccidental Petroleum and I've heard of the entity\nOxy Vinyls. And I just -- I guess my first\nquestion is, is the business of Oxy Vinyls\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 16\ndifferent than the business of Occidental\nPetroleum?\nMS. BROZ: Objection, form.\nA I -- I'm not sure I understand what that\nquestion is.\nQ Okay. What's the relationship between\nOxyChem and Occidental Petroleum?\nA Occidental Petroleum is our parent company\nand Oxy -- Occidental Chemical Corporation is a\nwholly-owned subsidiary, in my understanding, of\nOccidental Petroleum.\nQ And how does OxyChem relate to the entity\nOxy Vinyls?",
  "MS. BROZ: Objection, form. Calls for a\nlegal conclusion.\nA Can you repeat the question or rephrase\nit?\nQ Does Oxy Vinyls have any relationship to\nthe company Oxy Chemicals -- OxyChem?",
  "MS. BROZ: Objection, form, calls for a\nlegal conclusion.\nA We're all affiliated companies.\nQ So is Oxy Vinyls an affiliate of OxyChem?",
  "MS. BROZ: Same objections.\nA I'm not a corporate structure person. Oxy\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 17\nVinyls -- I'm not sure I can answer your question,\nunderstanding what -- it sounds like you're trying\nto ask a corporate structure question, and I'm not\nsure that I'm able to answer what you are looking\nfor.\nQ Well, do you have responsibility for\nsupply chain for Oxy Vinyls?\nA Yes. I have supply chain responsibilities\nfor all of Oxy Vinyls and all of Occidental\nChemical Corporation.\nQ So whatever the relationship is between\nthese entities, you are in change of their supply\nchains?\nA Yes.\nQ Okay. And do you have an understanding\nthat -- that Berkshire Hathaway is an investor in\nOxy Vinyls?\nMS. BROZ: Objection, form.\nA You stated Berkshire Hathaway is an\ninvestor of Oxy Vinyls. I understand them to be\nan investor in Occidental Petroleum Corporation\nbecause -\nQ Thank you.\nA -- OxyChem and Oxy Vinyls don't have\nstock. We're part of Occidental Petroleum.\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 18\nQ So Oxy Vinyls is part of Occidental\nPetroleum?",
  "MS. BROZ: Objection, form.\nA You are asking me corporate structure\nquestions that I'm not able to answer.\nQ Okay. I was just -- bear with me one\nsecond. Enough of that.\nSo with that understanding, when I refer\nto Oxy, you will understand that I'm referring to\nOxy Vinyls, correct?\nA Yes.\nQ Okay. And what is your current job title\nat OxyChem?\nA I am the vice president of supply chain.\nQ And are you the vice president of supply\nchain at Oxy Vinyls?\nA We don't designate that difference. It\nis -- on a daily basis we manage the supply chain\nfor all of Oxy Chemicals.\nQ And is your title as the VP supply chain\nat OxyChem the same title you held at OxyChem on\nor about February 3rd of 2023?",
  "MS. BROZ: Objection, form.\nA Can you repeat the question?\nQ Well, you were VP of supply chain at\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 19\nOxyChem on February 3rd, 2023, correct?\nA Yes, I was.\nQ Okay. And who do you report to at\nOxyChem?\nA I report to the president.\nQ And who is the president?\nA Wade Alleman.\nQ How long have you reported to the\npresident of OxyChem?",
  "MS. BROZ: Objection, form.\nA Can you repeat the question?\nQ How long have you reported to -- strike\nthat.\nYou work at Oxy's headquarters here in\nDallas; is that correct?\nA Yes, I do. Well, OxyChem's headquarters,\nyes.\nQ And tell me briefly what your\nresponsibilities are as VP of supply chain at\nOxyChem.\nA So I have the overall responsibility to\nlead the supply chain function, ensuring that we\ndeliver our products to our customers safely,\nefficiently, and timely.\nQ So I'm going to share with you what is\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 20\nmarked as Exhibit 1, and it is your LinkedIn\nprofile that we printed out just so we could ask\nyou some questions about some of the terminology\nin your description of your LinkedIn.\nExhibit 1 marked.)\nMS. BROZ: Jonathan, there is no URL on\nthis printout, if you obtained it from LinkedIn.\nMR. KNIGHT: Well, there is a URL. If you\nlook at the upper left, the URL, there is\nLinkedIn.com.\nMS. BROZ: Okay. And then what is the\ndate that you printed this out?\nMR. KNIGHT: I'll tell you in just a\nmoment. Printed it out on January 3rd, 2024.\nMS. BROZ: Thank you.\nQ Ms. Stegmann, have you updated your\nLinkedIn profile since January 3rd of 2024?\nA No, I have not.\nQ So if you look on the first page under\nDirector of Supply Chain, it says the\nresponsibilities are for demand chain planning and\nsome other things. I wanted to ask, what is\ndemand chain planning?\nA Demand chain planning is setting the\nproduction plans based on our business\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 21\nrequirements. So demand is the customer\nrequirements, and we plan for those and set the\nproduction schedules of our facilities based on\nthose business requirements.\nQ And what do you do in relation to demand\nchain planning?\nA When, what time frame? What do you mean,\nwhat do I do?\nQ I mean, do you have -- do you interface\nwith -- with people at the actual facilities that\nare producing Oxy's products?\nA I'm not sure I understand your question.\nQ So are you in charge of actually producing\nOxy Vinyl's products?\nA I supervise a team, and they're not\nresponsible -- they're responsible for taking the\nsales forecast requirements and matching those to\nour production capabilities. So they are\ndetermining what we need to produce based on\ncustomer forecasts and sales forecasts.\nQ And what do you do with that information\nof what needs to be produced?\nMS. BROZ: Objection, form.\nA Can you repeat the question?\nQ Sure. So you testified that you supervise\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 22\na team, and they are determining what we need to\nproduce based on customer forecasts and sales\nforecasts, correct? And once that determination\nis made, what is done with that determination?\nA I don't do anything with that information.\nQ Does somebody do something with that\ninformation?\nMS. BROZ: Objection, form.\nA I'm not sure I understand what you're\ntrying to ask.\nQ Well, is that information passed along to\nthe production facilities of Oxy Vinyls?\nA Yes. The demand chain planner develops\nthe schedule and passes that to the manufacturing\nfacilities.\nQ Okay. And the description in LinkedIn\nalso says that you're responsible for commercial\nlogistics. And what is commercial logistics?\nA Commercial logistics is setting the\nrelationship with our transportation providers.\nQ And is Norfolk Southern one of your\ntransportation providers?\nA Yes.\nQ And one of the products that Norfolk\nSouthern transports for Oxy Vinyls is vinyl\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 23\nchloride monomer, correct?\nA Yes, that is correct.\nQ And is it okay if I just refer to vinyl\nchloride monomer as VCM?\nA Yes.\nQ And Oxy Vinyls transports some of its VCM\nfrom one location to another location by railroad;\nis that correct?\nMS. BROZ: Objection, form.\nA Can you repeat that question?\nQ Well, Oxy Vinyl transports -- strike that.\nOxy Vinyls arranges to have vinyl chloride\nmonomer transported to its customers using the\nrailroads, correct?\nMS. BROZ: Objection, form.\nA You would have to repeat that question.\nQ Is -- is VCM manufactured by Oxy Vinyls\ntransported to customers of Oxy Vinyls by\nrailroad?\nMS. BROZ: Objection, form.\nA Can you -- can you repeat that question?\nQ Well, Oxy Vinyls manufactures VCM,\ncorrect?\nA Yes.\nQ And Oxy Vinyls transports that VCM to its\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 24\ncustomers, correct?\nA Yes.\nQ And that trans- -\nA Well, yes, yes, yes.\nQ And that transportation includes\ntransportation by railroad, correct?\nA I'm trying to recall if we transport -- we\ndo transport small quantities of VCM to our\ncustomers by rail.\nQ By \"small,\" can you quantify that more\nprecisely?\nA We also have customers that receive by\nvessels.\nQ And some of the VCM manufactured by Oxy\nVinyls is also transported to polyvinyl chloride\nmanufacturing facilities owned by Oxy Vinyls,\ncorrect?\nA Yes. We ship VCM to the PVC facilities\nowned by Oxy.\nQ And to save time, is it okay if I refer to\npolyvinyl chloride as PVC?\nA Yes.\nQ How would you break down the amount of VCM\nthat Oxy Vinyls manufactures for its own PVC\nfacilities compared to the amount that it\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 25\nmanufactures for customers besides Oxy Vinyls?\nA I don't know those numbers off the top of\nmy -\nQ Do you think that more than half of the\nVCM that Oxy Vinyls manufactures is sent to PVC\nplants owned by Oxy Vinyls?\nA I don't know those numbers off the top of\nmy head.\nQ Do you have -- can you provide an\nestimate?\nA I don't want to speculate. I would -- I\ndon't have those numbers.\nQ So as head of -- strike that.\nAs VP of supply chain, you can't provide\nan estimate of how much VCM is supplied to PVC\nplants owned by Oxy Vinyls?",
  "MS. BROZ: Objection, form, asked and\nanswered.\nA Under oath, I don't want to speculate. I\njust don't recall the number.\nQ So just to summarize, you're responsible\nfor demand chain planning, rail transportation,\nand commercial logistics of VCM for Oxy Vinyls,\ncorrect?\nA I was as director of supply chain, which\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 26\nnow reports to me as the VP of supply chain.\nQ So you are ultimately responsible?\nA Yes.\nQ Okay. And you testified that vinyl\nchloride monomer manufactured by Oxy Vinyls is\nalso shipped by means other than rail; is that\ncorrect?\nA Yes.\nQ And what are those other means?\nA We ship it to -- by pipeline to our\nfacilities in Houston and we ship -- we have a\ncustomer pickup by vessel.\nQ And sitting here today, can you tell me\nwhether shipment by pipeline and shipment by\ncustomer pickup constitute a larger quantity of\nvinyl chloride monomer compared to shipment by\nrail?\nMS. BROZ: Objection to form.\nA Can you repeat the question?\nQ Is rail transport -- strike that.\nDo you transport more VCM by rail than by\npipeline?\nA No, I would not think so based on -- I'm\nthinking of the facilities where we're shipping\nfrom.\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 27\nQ So your understanding is that Oxy Vinyls\nships more VCM by pipeline than by rail?\nA For sure by pipeline and marine movements\nis greater than rail combined.\nQ Thank you.\nAnd I think we previously touched on Oxy\nVinyls' PVC plants before, and my question is, how\nis VCM used at Oxy Vinyls' PVC plants?\nMS. BROZ: Objection, form.\nA What do you mean by the term \"used\"?\nQ Well, is VCM used in polymerization at Oxy\nVinyls' PVC plants?\nMS. BROZ: Objection, form.\nA Can you rephrase the question for my\nunderstanding?\nQ Well, how is VCM used at Oxy Vinyls' PVC\nplants?\nMS. BROZ: Objection, form.\nA I'm not sure what you mean by the word\nused,\" so I'm trying to understand what you're\nasking so I can -\nQ Do you have an understanding of what the\nword \"used\" means?\nA I don't understand it in the context of\nyour question.\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 28\nQ Okay. And -- well, is -- is VCM a raw\nmaterial used in the synthesis of PVC?\nMS. BROZ: Objection, form.\nA P -- VCM is used as a raw material in the\nPVC polymerization process.\nQ And the PVC plants owned by Oxy Vinyls\ninclude PVC processes that you referred to,\ncorrect?\nMS. BROZ: Objection, form.\nA Can you repeat the question as asked?\nQ So Oxy Vinyls has PVC plants, correct?\nA Oxy Vinyls owns PVC plants, correct.\nQ And those PVC plants are engaged in the\nsynthesis of PVC, correct?\nA The PVC plants manufacture polymerized VCM\nto make polyvinyl chloride resins.\nQ Thank you. How many PVC plants does Oxy\nhave -- Oxy Vinyls have?\nA We have three -- I'm sorry, four. I\ncounted Houston as one.\nQ And where are Oxy Vinyls' facilities?\nA Niagara, Ontario, there's a PVC facility.\nYou said -- you said Oxy Vinyls facilities. I'll\ngive you the PVC facilities: Niagara, Ontario;\nPedricktown, New Jersey; and in Houston we have\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 29\nPasadena, Texas, and Deer Park, Texas.\nQ So was one of the facilities that you\nmentioned in Pedricktown, New Jersey?\nA Yes.\nQ And can you describe your level of\nfamiliarity with the polymerization process\ncurrently employed at the Oxy Vinyls Pedricktown\nfacility?\nA I was the plant manager of the Pedricktown\nfacility for approximately five years. However, I\nhave not been onsite since 2004.\nQ Well, at the time that you were the plant\nmanager and that you were onsite, can you describe\nthe polymerization process that was implemented at\nthe Pedricktown facility?\nA Can I describe it, yes, but it's been many\nyears.\nQ Well, was the process a batch process?\nA The reaction process in the reactor area\nis a batch process.\nQ And have you heard the term \"suspension\npolymerization\"?\nA Yes.\nQ And was the Pedricktown process a\nsuspension polymerization?\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 30\nA Yes.\nQ And in the suspension polymerization, was\nvinyl chloride monomer added to water in the\npolymerization reactor?\nA Can you repeat that question?\nQ In the suspension polymerization process\nat the Pedricktown, New Jersey facility, while you\nwere plant manager there, was the reaction\nconducted in a batch reactor involving adding\nvinyl chloride monomer to water?\nMS. BROZ: Objection, form.\nA The batch process includes reacting or\nhaving water and vinyl chloride monomer added to\nthe reactor.\nQ And do you recall the ratio of vinyl\nchloride monomer to water in the process?\nA I wouldn't recall that level of detail\ntoday.\nQ And then I think another facility you\nmentioned that produces PVC for Oxy Vinyls is the\nDeer Park, Texas facility?\nA Yes.\nQ And I had the same questions above, is it\na batch process?\nA Yes, it is a batch process, in the reactor\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 31\narea.\nQ And is the reaction a suspension\npolymerization process?\nA Yes, it is a suspension polymerization\nprocess.\nQ And so for all of Oxy Vinyls' PVC plants,\ndo they all employ batch reactors for their\npolymerization reaction process?\nA Yes.\nQ And do they all employ suspension\npolymerization?\nA Yes.\nQ So let's -- if we go down your work\nhistory, I just wanted to ask some -- a few more\nbackground questions.\nIn what city and state did you attend high\nschool?\nA Richland, Washington.\nQ And tell me your education after high\nschool.\nA What is the question?\nQ What was your education after high school?\nA I have a bachelor's degree and a master's\ndegree.\nQ And what was your bachelor's degree in?\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 32\nA Chemical engineering.\nQ And you graduated in 1989, correct?\nA That's correct.\nQ During your undergraduate education, did\nyou have any internships or unemployment or -- or\nemployment during college?\nA Can you repeat that? Any -\nQ Sure. During your time at the University\nof Delaware pursuing your degree in chemical\nengineering, did you have any internships?\nA I did not have an internship, but I did\nhave summer -- well, I guess summer roles, not\nduring the semester, but in the summers.\nQ And what were your summer roles?\nA One summer I worked at the University of\nDelaware in the chemical engineering and biology\nlabs, so I was a research assistant. I don't\nremember the exact title. And then the following\nyear, I worked at Dupont.\nQ And where was -- was it that you worked at\nDupont?\nA At the experimental station outside of\nWilmington, Delaware.\nQ And when did you first become aware of\nOxy?\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 33\nMS. BROZ: Objection, form.\nA At first during the college hiring\nprocess.\nQ So you interviewed with Oxy and eventually\ntook a job at Oxy, correct?\nA Yes, I interviewed at Oxy and accepted a\nposition with Oxy.\nQ And that was your first job after\ngraduating from the University of Delaware in\ncorrect?\nA That is correct.\nQ And you have been employed continuously at\nOxy ever since, correct?\nA Correct.\nQ So I just wanted to walk through briefly\nthe different positions you had before you became\nvice president of supply chain at OxyChem.\nAnd if you look at what you're doing, page\nof Exhibit 1, you worked for a number of years\nat Oxy's Pasadena PVC facility; is that correct?\nA Yes, that is correct.\nQ And the Pasadena PVC facility produced PVC\nfrom polymerization of vinyl chloride, correct?\nA Pasadena produces PVC resin from the\npolymerization -- by the polymerization of vinyl\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 34\nchloride monomer.\nQ I want to ask you just a few more\nquestions about the polymerization process\nemployed by Oxy Vinyls.\nYou mentioned that the polymerization is\nconducted in a polymerization reactor; is that\nright?\nMS. BROZ: Just to be clear, Jonathan,\nbefore, your questions were about when she was at",
  "Pedricktown. Are you asking about then or now?\nMR. KNIGHT: I'm asking about then. I'm\nasking about when she was employed at -- at the\nPasadena PVC facility.\nMS. BROZ: Okay. Just want to make sure\nthat the record is clear.\nA Okay. I'm sorry, can you refresh me on\nthe question?\nQ For sure. I just wanted to ask a few more\nquestions about the -- strike that.\nI wanted to ask a few questions about the\npolymerization process that was -- that was\noccurring at the Pasadena facility, and you\nmentioned earlier -- well, strike that.\nThe process was a batch process, correct?\nA I stated the reactor area was a batch\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 35\nprocess.\nQ And what was the -- what material of\nconstruction was the reactor made of?\nA I believe it was 316 stainless, but I'm\nnot going to remember these details from 25 years.\nQ Do you have -- are you aware of whether or\nnot any of the vessels or plumbing in that PVC\nprocess contain aluminum?\nMS. BROZ: Objection, form.\nA I wouldn't recall that level of detail.\nQ So you've been plant manager at a number\nof Oxy Vinyls' PVC facilities, correct?\nA Yes.\nQ And in any of those facilities, are you\naware of whether or not any vessels or plumbing in\nthose PVC processes contain aluminum?\nMS. BROZ: Objection, form.\nA I'm not sure I understand what you\nreferred to as plumbing or containing of aluminum.\nQ Okay. So first of all, does the reactor\nvessels in any of those facilities include\naluminum as a material of construction?\nMS. BROZ: Objection, form.\nA Again, I am not the expert knowledge, and\nthis is over 20-some years ago, so...\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 36\nQ Well, in any of the facility -- I'm\nasking -- now I'm asking about any of the\nfacilities where you have been the plant manager.\nA I haven't been a plant manager for over 10\nyears.\nQ Thank you. Okay. And so you don't have\nany recollection about the materials of\nconstruction of the polymerization reactor?\nA I didn't say that. Because I told you\nthat I believed I answered that the reactor was\nmade of 316 stainless, if I remember correctly.\nQ Okay. And let me clarify what I meant by\nplumbing.\"\nWhat I'm asking is, is do you have\nknowledge of whether the piping that connects the\nreactor with other process components contains\naluminum?\nMS. BROZ: Objection, form.\nA I don't recall aluminum being used. That\nis not -- I just don't recall it being used in the\nprocess other than aluminum tubing for\ntransmitters and instrumentation.\nQ Okay. And with respect to the Pasadena\nPVC plant, do you have a recollection of what\ntemperature the vinyl chloride was introduced to\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 37\nthe polymerization reactor at?\nMS. BROZ: Objection, form.\nA No. I would not recall that level of\ndetail today.\nQ And with respect to any of the PVC\nfacilities where you were plant manager, do you\nhave a recollection of what temperature the vinyl\nchloride monomer was introduced to the\npolymerization reactor at?\nMS. BROZ: Objection, form.\nA I don't recall a specific temperature.\nQ Do you recall a range of temperature?\nA Not a range, but I do know that it's an\nambient temperature. You have a storage tank, and\nyou are charging it to your reactor, but...\nQ So the vinyl chloride monomer wasn't\nheated before it was introduced to the\npolymerization reactor; is that fair?\nA Correct.\nQ And the vinyl chloride monomer would have\nbeen introduced to the polymerization reactor say\nat a temperature of less than 110 degrees\nFahrenheit; is that fair?\nMS. BROZ: Objection to form.\nA Can you repeat that question?\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 38\nQ Strike that.\nI want to ask, do you have a recollection\nof the temperature at which polymerization was\nconducted at any of the PVC facilities where you\nwere plant manager?\nMS. BROZ: Objection, form, foundation.\nA Can you repeat that question?\nQ So now I'm asking with respect to -- to\nthe PVC facilities by Oxy Vinyls where you were\nplant manager. And my question is -- well, have\nyou ever had an understanding of what temperature\npolymerization of VCM to form PVC would have been\nconducted at at any of those facilities?\nMS. BROZ: Objection, form.\nA Yes. I would have understood the\ntemperature and the batch process in my early\nyears when I was a process engineer in Pasadena.\nQ And you have a current recollection of\nwhat temperature that was?\nA The -- I mean, temperature is very\nspecific for setting your product viscosity of\nPVC, and so that temperature is dependent on what\nproduct you're making. PVC is a generic product.\nThere's grades of PVC, and each grade of PVC may\nhave a different reaction temperature.\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 39\nQ And generally a higher temperature is\ngoing to yield a lower molecular weight PVC,\ncorrect?\nA I believe you have -- you are asking\nquestions that are beyond my recollection.\nQ Well, how many grades of PVC does Oxy\nVinyls make?\nA I don't know that number anymore off the\ntop of my head to that level of degree.\nQ Would it have been more than five?\nA I can think of more than five, but I can't\nbe more specific than that. I'm not at that level\nof detail today.\nQ And were there any PVC polymerization\ntemperatures for the processes conducted by Oxy\nVinyls in excess of 100 degrees Fahrenheit?\nA Can you repeat that question?\nQ So you testified that Oxy Vinyls\nmanufactures multiple grades of PVC, correct?\nA Yes.\nQ And you testified that the temperature\nused to make those different grades could be\ndifferent for different grades, correct?",
  "A The reaction temperature would be\ndifferent potentially for different grades.\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 40\nQ And so my question is, do you recall if\nany of the reaction temperatures were in excess of\ndegrees Fahrenheit?\nA Yes.\nQ And were any of the reaction temperatures\nin excess of 150 degrees Fahrenheit?\nA Not at the reaction process, no.\nQ So the reaction temperatures were less\nthan 150 degrees Fahrenheit?\nA That's my recollection.\nQ Thank you.\nHow long does it take to make PVC in Oxy\nVinyls' batch reactor?\nMS. BROZ: Objection, form.\nA At what time period?\nQ Well, I'm asking how long the\npolymerization reaction takes.\nMS. BROZ: Same objection.\nA I would not know that value today. I've\nbeen out of the plants for more than 10 years.\nQ And do you have a recollection of how long\nit took when you were involved in plant management\nyears ago?\nA How long what took?\nQ The polymerization reaction that occurred\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 41\nin the PVC plants.\nMS. BROZ: Objection, form.\nA I don't recall that level of detail.\nQ Would it have been more than an hour?\nA Yes, I can say that.\nQ And more than two hours?\nA I can say I know it is greater than four\nhours, but beyond that, I don't want to give a\nnumber that is incorrect.\nQ Thank you. And do you have a recollection\nyears ago -- from 10 years ago when you were\nstill a PVC plant manager what pressure the\nprocess was conducted at?\nA No. And I want to be clear, 10 years ago\nI was over five facilities in Houston, so it has\nbeen quite some time since I've had direct\nresponsibility for just the PVC plant at this\nlevel of detail.\nQ Understood, and I was just trying to get a\nsense if you have personal knowledge of, you know,\nthe pressure the polymerization at Oxy Vinyls'\nfacilities is conducted at.",
  "MS. BROZ: Is there a question?\nQ Well, that is my question. Do you have\nknowledge of the pressure?\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 42\nA I don't recall the pressure setting and\nthe pressure reaction of the reaction.\nQ Do you recall whether it was more than one\natmosphere?\nA One atmosphere of pressure?\nQ Yes.\nA One psi?\nQ That is 14, right?\nA Right.\nQ Atmosphere is 14 psi.\nA Okay. So please rephrase your question.\nQ Well, my question is just whether you\nrecall the pressure at which the polymerization\nreaction was carried out in Oxy Vinyls'\nfacilities?\nA I don't recall the pressures.\nQ So I want to jump ahead a little bit to\nwhen you became director of supply chain in\nSeptember of 2012.\nAm I correct that you were director of\nsupply chain during a derailment of the train\ncarrying VCM tank cars in November of 2012?\nA Yes, that is correct.\nQ And is it okay if I refer to that as the\nPaulsboro derailment?\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 43\nA Yes.\nQ And can you describe your level of\nfamiliarity with the Paulsboro derailment?\nA I am aware of the derailment. At that\ntime I was director of supply chain. I was\ntransitioning, so I was moving from Houston to\nDallas at that time, and actually the day of the\nderailment, I was closing on my house here in\nDallas. So I was not as involved as I would have\nbeen had I not been closing on my house.\nQ Well, do you have an understanding of what\ncaused the derailment?\nMS. BROZ: Objection, form.\nA I -- go ahead, ask the question.\nQ I want to ask the question again, so\nstrike that.\nA Okay.\nQ Do you have -- do you have an\nunderstanding of what caused the Paulsboro\nderailment?\nMS. BROZ: Objection, form.\nA I don't know that I have the level of\ndetail understanding of what caused it. We\nweren't part of the investigation.\nQ So you say that you were not part of the\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 44\ninvestigation. Was there an investigation?\nA The NTSB conducted an investigation.\nQ And is your testimony that Oxy was not\nparty to the investigation?\nA I don't recall us being party to the\ninvestigation.\nQ Did Oxy have any participation at all in\nthe NTSB investigation?\nA Not I that know of or recall. There may\nhave been, but I may not have been knowledgeable\nof it, but I don't recall.\nQ Okay. Did the Paulsboro derailment\ninvolve railcars carrying Oxy's vinyl chloride\nmonomer?\nA Yes.\nQ And do you recall how many railcars?\nA I know there was Oxy railcars. I can't\nremember the exact number. I know there was more\nthan one.\nQ And do you know what happened to the vinyl\nchloride monomer during the Paulsboro derailment?\nMS. BROZ: Objection, form.\nA What do you mean, what happened?\nQ Well, let me back up.\nDo you have an understanding of what\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 45\nhappened to the railcars carrying Oxy's VCM when\nthe derailment occurred?\nA I have some recollection.\nQ Could you please describe that?\nA I recall that Conrail railroad was moving\nthe cars over a bridge in the Paulsboro area, and\nthere was a failure mechanism and the train\nderailed, and one of our cars fell from the bridge\nas part of the derailment and was punctured in the\nwaterway.\nQ And so the VCM train car was breached; is\nthat another way to say it?\nA Correct. The one vinyl car was breached.\nQ And the VCM in that railcar was released;\nis that correct?\nA Yes.\nQ Okay. And do you know where the VCM tank\ncars that derailed in the Paulsboro derailment\nwere headed as a final destination?\nA Pedricktown facility, yes.\nQ And was that Pedricktown facility an Oxy\nVinyls PVC plant?\nA Yes.\nQ And is that the same facility that the\nNorfolk -- that the Oxy Vinyls tank cars on the\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 46\nNorfolk Southern Train 32N were headed -\nA Correct.\nQ -- when -- okay, thank you.\nMS. BROZ: We've been going about an hour.\nIs this a good time to break?\nMR. KNIGHT: That would be just fine.\nThank you. Take 10 minutes. Is that good?\nMS. BROZ: Sure.\nVIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the\nrecord. The time is 10:30 a.m.\nRecess 10:30 a.m. to 10:46 a.m.)\nVIDEOGRAPHER: We are going back on the\nrecord. The time is 10:46 a.m.\nQ I just want to ask one other question\nabout the Paulsboro derailment. You stated that\nyou were not involved in any investigation\nconducted by the NTSB in that derailment, correct?\nA I stated that, meaning I don't think we\nwere a party to the investigation.\nVIDEOGRAPHER: Excuse me, Counsel, do you\nhave your mic connected?\nMR. KNIGHT: I don't, I apologize.\nVIDEOGRAPHER: Thank you.\nMR. KNIGHT: I will put that on.\nQ Well, did you have any involvement in some\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 47\ncapacity other than as a party to the NTSB\ninvestigation?\nA I don't know for sure, but if they were\ninvestigating, they may have requested documents\nfrom us but I don't know.\nQ Okay. Do you know whether there were any\nchanges to the manner in which Oxy Vinyls prepared\nrailcars of VCM for shipping in response to the\nPaulsboro derailment?\nA I know that we did implement changes as a\nresult of our review.\nQ And could you describe the review to me,\nplease?\nA I don't know what you mean by \"describing\nthe review.\"\nQ Well, were you involved in the review?\nA I don't know what you mean by \"review.\"\nQ Okay. So you testified that, \"I know we\ndid implement changes as a result of our review,\"\nso that's the review I'm referring to. And my\nquestion is, did you have a role in \"our review\"?\nA Not a specific role.\nQ So did you have any role whatsoever?\nA Our role going forward was to make sure\nthat we had the systems in place to properly\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 48\nsecure our -- our railcar shipments.\nQ Could you name for me some of the people\nwho were involved in the review?\nA Not from that many years ago. I do know\nTom Woodka was the plant manager at Pedricktown at\nthe time.\nQ So would he have been involved in the\nreview?\nA I believe so.\nQ And was the vinyl chloride monomer tank\ncar that derailed coming from the La Porte VCM\nfacility?\nA Yes, that's my recollection.\nQ And would somebody from the La Porte VCM\nfacility be involved in the review?\nA Possibly and likely.\nQ And do you have any idea who that might\nhave been?\nA No.\nQ Okay. So you testified there were some\nchanges that resulted from the review. Could you\ndescribe those changes?\nA In a general high sense, what we wanted to\ndo was make sure we had safeguards to ensure that\nwe maintained the volume and weight outage,\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 49\nmeaning there's different requirements to ensure\nthat you don't overload a railcar. And what we\nwanted to do was make sure those calculations were\nin place, and we implemented some safeguards\nwithin our ERP system.\nQ So what does it mean to, when you say,\noverload a railcar\"?\nA If you put more material in it and exceed\na weight limit, or there's also an outage volume\nvapor space requirement that you need to maintain.\nQ And did you have any indication that those\nrequirements were violated in the railcar that\nderailed in the Paulsboro derailment?\nMS. BROZ: Objection, form.\nA I don't recall the -- the loading of the\nspecific car that derailed in the Paulsboro\nincident, but I know we looked at that process as\na result of the Paulsboro incident.\nQ And you -- when you looked at that\nprocess, you found there was room for improvement?\nA Yes. And what we did was implement layers\nof protection to ensure that we could prevent a\nshipment of a car that would have any concerns in\nthat area. So we put that in our enterprise\nresource planning system, SAP, to prevent a\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 50\nshipment of a car that would be considered\noverloaded or not meeting the volume outage\nrequirements.\nQ And so what did you add to your process\nthat reduced the risk that you would have an\noverloaded tank car?\nA I don't remember specifically the details\nof what we added, but I think there were some\ncalculations and administrative processes and then\nlike a flag or a system identifier in our SAP\nsystem.\nQ And is a similar review occurring with\nrespect to the East Palestine derailment?\nA Can you repeat the question?\nQ Well, is a similar review of -- strike\nthat.\nIs a review of Oxy Vinyls' procedures for\nloading a tank car with vinyl chloride monomer for\nshipment occurring in response to the\nEast Palestine, Ohio derailment?",
  "MS. BROZ: Objection, form.\nA The NTSB investigation drove a lot of\nreviews of our procedures and processes.\nQ And are those reviews ongoing?\nA The investigation factual reports are\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 51\ncompleted.\nQ Are you referring -- strike that.\nWhen you say \"the investigation factual\nreports are completed,\" are you referring to the\nNTSB factual reports?\nA Yes.\nQ And so I'm not asking about what the NTSB\nis doing. I'm asking about what Oxy is doing.\nA Oxy, as a participant in the NTSB\ninvestigation, had many elements of its loading\nprocess reviewed. That process is complete, and\nwe're not -- I'm not aware of any ongoing\nactivities as a result of the derailment. My\npoint is that the NTSB investigation drove us. We\nhad to as part of the investigative -\ninvestigation.\nQ And now that those reviews are complete,\nare -- has Oxy made any changes to the manner in\nwhich it prepares tank cars of vinyl chloride\nmonomer for shipment?\nA Not that I'm aware of.\nQ Thank you.\nSo in your role as VP supply chain, are\nyou familiar with the destination of Oxy's vinyl\nchloride monomer tank cars?\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 52\nMS. BROZ: Objection, form.\nA I'm not sure what you mean by\ndesignation.\"\nQ I apologize, let me say it again.\nIn your role as VP of supply chain, are\nyou familiar with the destinations of Oxy's vinyl\nchloride monomer tank cars?\nMS. BROZ: Objection, form.\nA I don't know what you mean by being\nfamiliar with the destination. Do I know where\nthey're going? I don't know what you mean.\nQ Do you know where they're going?\nA I know where some of the shipments are\ngoing.\nQ Are there some shipments that you don't\nknow where they're going?\nA I would -- obviously I know that the vinyl\nchloride that we're shipping to Pedricktown and\nNiagara, I know those locations. I don't know\nthat I would recall or be able to speak to all of\nthe destinations.\nQ And you testified earlier that the VP of\nsupply chain engages in the analysis of the supply\nchain; is that fair?\nA I lead a team that has a responsibility\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 53\nfor various functions within supply chain.\nQ And can you give me a description of what\ngoes into that analysis?\nA What analysis?\nQ Analysis of the supply chain.\nMS. BROZ: Objection, form.\nA I don't think I stated that we do an\nanalysis of supply chain.\nQ Let me ask it this way. What does Oxy\nconsider in determining where vinyl chloride\nmonomer is shipped?",
  "MS. BROZ: Objection, form.\nA Can you rephrase the question? I'm not\nsure what you're asking.\nQ Well, does Oxy consider the risk of\nderailment in determining where it ships its vinyl\nchloride monomer by rail?\nA No. We expect the railroad carriers to\nsafely transport our products to their\ndestination. We, as a shipper, have received -\nor customer of the railroads, we receive ourselves\nmultiple awards from the rail carriers for our\nsafe securement of our cars.\nWe recently received a safe shipper award\nfor our 2022 shipping on the NS. We won the\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 54\nThoroughbred safety award and were recognized in\nOctober of 2023 at the AAR tank car committee by\nNS, as well as six of the seven Class I railroads.\nQ So given that, what is your basis for your\nstatement that you expect safe shipment of vinyl\nchloride monomer by rail carriers?\nA Railroads have the operating\nresponsibility for transporting for trains. They\nhave the safety procedures and safety systems. We\nhave the responsibility for safely securing the\nrailcars prior to shipment and we have\ndemonstrated based on our safe shipping history.\nWe recently won an award from CSX for\nshipping safely on their system for 15 years. I\nrecently met with Joe Hendricks, their CEO, to\nrecognize that accomplishment in November of this\nyear in Florida -- or Georgia.\nQ Given that, you certainly wouldn't allow a\nrailcar of VCM to be shipped on a rail if you\nthought there was a good chance of it derailing,\nwould you?\nA I'm surprised that a railroad is asking me\nabout a big chance of having a derailment.\nQ Why not? Do you want me to repeat the\nquestion?\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 55\nYou wouldn't allow a railcar of VCM to be\nshipped on a rail if you thought there was a risk\nof derailment, would you?\nA No.\nQ So you think shipment by rail is a safe\nway to transport vinyl chloride monomer, correct?\nA Shipment by rail is a safe way to\ntransport all goods including vinyl chloride\nmonomer stabilized, and I believe the AAR industry\nhas many publications about the safe transport of\nthe rail industry and their capabilities,\nabilities, and safeguards for safely transporting\ngoods by rail.\nQ And you -- you continue to ship vinyl\nchloride monomer -- strike that.\nOxy Vinyls continues to ship vinyl\nchloride monomer by contracting with Norfolk\nSouthern, correct?",
  "A We safely tran- -- or, yes, we today ship\nstabilized vinyl chloride monomer with the NS.\nQ And you today ship stabilized vinyl\nchloride monomer with Norfolk Southern through\nEast Palestine, Ohio, correct?\nA I believe that's the same -- the current\nrouting. I'm not aware of any rerouting.\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 56\nQ Okay. So a concern that there would be a\nderailment on a Norfolk Southern train involving\nan Oxy Vinyls vinyl chloride monomer tank car\nisn't a consideration in your supply chain\nplanning, correct?",
  "MS. BROZ: Objection, form. Misstates\nprior testimony.\nA Can you restate the question?\nMR. KNIGHT: Well, I didn't -- I didn't\nread back to her prior testimony. I was just\nasking a question.\nQ My question is -- I'll restate it for you.\nYou, as VP of supply chain, don't have a\nconcern that a Norfolk Southern train carrying\nvinyl chloride monomer is going to derail,\ncorrect?\nMS. BROZ: Objection, form.\nA We expect the railroad carriers based on\nregulations of our federal government, the FRA,\nthe Department of Transportation, to be able to\nsafely transport goods by rail, including -\nQ If you didn't -- I apologize.\nA -- including stabilized vinyl chloride\nmonomer.\nQ And if you didn't have that expectation,\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 57\nyou wouldn't ship by rail vinyl chloride monomer,\ncorrect?\nA The expectation is that we are able to\nship under the common carrier obligation our\nproducts safely by the rail carriers, and they\nhave an obligation to provide safe transport of\ngoods by rail.",
  "Q And what is the common carrier obligation?\nA Railroads have an obligation to provide\nrail service to customers.\nQ And they don't -- Norfolk Southern doesn't\nhave the option of declining to ship vinyl\nchloride monomer for Oxy Vinyls?\nA Oh, yes, they do. They competitively\nsought our business. They competitively sought\nour business. We have shipped by the CSX and the\nNS, and the NS has competitively sought our\nbusiness.\nQ And they won your business, correct?\nA Yes. And we were a safe shipper on their\nrail line and won the award for 2022.\nQ Do you have an understanding of who your\nlargest customer for vinyl chloride monomer is\nbesides Oxy Vinyls' PVC plants?\nA Yes.\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 58\nQ And who is that?\nA I believe it is Orbia.\nQ Do they happen to receive their shipments\nby rail?\nA Some.\nQ Okay. From a supply chain perspective, if\nthe day came where you couldn't ship vinyl\nchloride monomer by rail, how would you respond to\nthat?\nA Can you repeat the question?\nMS. BROZ: Objection, form.\nQ So as VP of supply chain, if the day came\nthat -- where you couldn't ship vinyl chloride\nmonomer by rail, what would you do?\nA Isn't that -\nMS. BROZ: Objection, form.\nA Isn't that speculation?\nQ Isn't it your testimony that you haven't\nconsidered that scenario?\nA Yeah, I haven't considered that scenario.\nQ Okay. Do you have an understanding\nsitting here today of about how many tank cars of\nVCM the La Porte facility has shipped in the last\nyear?\nA Can you repeat that question?\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 59\nQ Do you have an understanding of how many\ntank cars of vinyl chloride monomer the La Porte\nVCM facility has shipped by rail in the last 12\nmonths?\nA I don't recall the specific numbers at\nthis point.\nQ Would it -- would it have been in the\nthousands?\nA I don't recall the number.\nQ Would it have been more than 100 tank\ncars?\nA I can say it is more than 100, but I\nhaven't really sat to look at the numbers. I\nmean, I know we would have that information, but I\ndon't know that, and again, I don't want to guess\nunder oath.\nQ Do you have an understanding of the dollar\nvalue of the vinyl chloride monomer in a VCM tank\ncar?\nMS. BROZ: Objection, form.\nA What do you mean by \"dollar value\"?\nQ How much you sell it for.\nMS. BROZ: Objection, form, foundation.\nA Those are on our financials.

Okay.\nQ Ms. Stegmann, what is this document?\nA It appears to be a news article\nforwarded -- or I don't know if a news article is\nthe correct -- or editorial, but obviously a\npublication that was forwarded.\nQ It was forwarded to you by Neil Ackerman,\ncorrect?\nA I believe it was forwarded by our\ncommunication, Celina Cardenas.\nQ That is right. Thank you. And you\nreceived this email, correct?\nA Yes.\nQ Okay.\nA According to this.\nQ Go to page 2. There is a writing titled:\nWe shouldn't use body bags to learn from Ohio's\ntrain disaster.\nDo you see that?\nA Yes, that appears to be the title.\nQ And I want to ask you about the second\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 61\nparagraph in this article. The third sentence\nstates that the only sure way to avoid future\naccidents is to stop transporting dangerous\nmaterials across vast distances, whether by train,\ncar, or pipeline, since they all present risks.\nMy question is, do you have an\nunderstanding of how a ban on the transport of\nvinyl chloride monomer would affect Oxy's\nbusiness?\nMS. BROZ: Objection, form, foundation.\nA Can you repeat the question?\nQ Do you have an understanding of how a stop\nto the transporting of vinyl chloride monomer by\ntrain would affect Oxy's business?\nMS. BROZ: Objection, form, foundation.\nA I think the question is overly vague.\nQ Well, would a ban on the transport of VCM\nby rail have an effect on Oxy Vinyls' business?\nA Yes.\nQ Would Oxy Vinyls be able to meet its\nsupply chain commitments by shipping the VCM other\nway -- some other way if they were unable to ship\nit by rail?\nMS. BROZ: Objection, form.\nA If there was a ban by rail. I mean,\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 62\nobviously we have rail destinations that we\nwouldn't be able to serve.\nQ Okay. And do you have an opinion about\nwhether you agree or disagree with this article?\nMS. BROZ: Objection, form, foundation.\nA Could you rephrase the question?\nQ Well, do you think there should be a ban\non the transport of vinyl chloride monomer by\nrail?\nMS. BROZ: Objection, form, foundation.\nA I think chemicals play a critical role\ninto public health and modern life as we\nunderstand it today, and I think that we need to\nexpect and hold our railroads accountable to\nsafely transporting all materials that are shipped\nby rail.\nQ And you agree that we should also hold the\nmanufacturers of the hazardous materials that are\ntransported by rail accountable for the manner in\nwhich they prepare hazardous materials for\ntransport, correct?",
  "MS. BROZ: Objection, form, foundation,\ncalls for a legal conclusion.\nA Could you rephrase your question?\nQ Well, you agree that Oxy Vinyls should be\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 63\naccountable to the manner in which it prepares its\nvinyl chloride monomer for shipment by rail?\nMS. BROZ: Objection, form, foundation.\nA Oxy Vinyls safely secures its railcars for\ntransport.\nQ And they should be held accountable to\nachieve that, correct?\nA I don't know -\nMS.

It seems to be a summary document.\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 64\nQ And did you receive this document from\nCelina Cardenas?\nA Yes.\nQ And who is Celina Cardenas?\nA She is our communications representative\nmanager.\nQ Does she report to you?\nA No.\nQ Does she work on the government affairs\npart of Oxy Vinyls?\nA Communications.\nQ I wanted to ask you about a statement near\nthe end of the first page of this document. It",
  "says: The speaker comments included generic\nstatements around the transport of such chemicals\nis unsafe, disproportionately impacts underserved\ncommunities as seen through East Palestine\nderailment.\nSo my question is, do you agree or\ndisagree with that statement?\nMS. BROZ: Objection, form.\nA I didn't hear the speaker make the\ncomment. I don't know its context.\nQ But do you agree with her statement that\nthe transport of vinyl chloride monomer is unsafe\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 65\nand disproportionately impacts underserved\ncommunities?\nMS. BROZ: Objection, form.\nA Can you repeat the question?\nQ Do you agree with the statement that the\ntransport of VCM is unsafe and disproportionately\nimpacts underserved communities?\nA I can't say how it impacts underserved\ncommunities. I don't know what communities\nthey're referencing, and I don't know what they\nmean by disproportionately impacting those\nunderserved communities.\nQ So you think there are -- strike that.\nSo as VP's supply chain, you plan to\ncontinue shipping VCM by rail, correct?\nA Continue with the shipments that are by\nrail today, correct.\nQ And you plan to continue shipping VCM by\nrail through East Palestine, Ohio, correct?\nA We continue to ship VCM on the Norfolk\nSouthern. They determine the routing. We also\nship VCM on the UP. It leaves our facility on the\nUnion Pacific and is interchanged to the Norfolk\nSouthern.\nQ I will show you what is going to be marked\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 66\nas Exhibit 4.\nExhibit 4 marked.)\nQ So this email is -- has a subject of the\nVinyl Institute monthly board report. I want to\nask you, do you have an understanding of who is\nthe Vinyl Institute?\nA I don't recall ever seeing this document.\nQ That is okay. I was -- my question wasn't\nabout the document. It was just generally, do you\nknow who is the Vinyl Institute?\nA I understand the Vinyl Institute is a\ntrade association that we belong to.\nQ And so Oxy is a member of the Vinyl\nInstitute; is that correct?\nA That's my understanding, correct.\nQ Okay. Do you have any interaction in your\ncapacity as VP of supply chain with the Vinyl\nInstitute?\nA I do not.\nQ If you go to the bottom of page 1, the\nnext-to-last bullet, second sentence says: The\nU.S. Department of Justice has filed a suit\nagainst Norfolk Southern just last week. While\nthis continues, the VI is working with the\nAmerican Chemistry Council and the Chlorine\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 67\nInstitute and congressional allies to monitor\npotential legislation and regulatory impacts.\nMy question is, do you have an\nunderstanding of who is the American Chemistry\nCouncil?\nA Yes.\nQ And do you know whether Oxy has a\nrelationship with the American Chemical Council?\nA Yes.\nQ I apologize, I meant to say American\nChemistry Council?\nA Yes.\nQ And you are a member of the American\nChemistry Council; is that correct?\nA \"Me\" being me? Or you be -\nQ You in your capacity at Oxy?\nA Yes.\nQ And what is your role?\nA At Oxy?\nQ At the American Chemistry Council?\nA I am a member participant.\nQ So I want to show you what's going to be\nmarked as Exhibit 5.\nExhibit 5 marked.)\nQ Ms. Stegmann, what is this document?\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 68\nA It looks like it's a document from the ACC\nto set up a call.\nQ If you go to the second page, the email is\nfrom a Jeffrey Sloan to you and somebody named\nJohn Heater. My question is, who is Jeffrey\nSloan?\nA Jeffrey Sloan is a director within the\nAmerican Chemistry Council, but my relationship\nwith Jeffrey Sloan is that he is the leader of the\ndistribution committee at the American Chemistry\nCouncil which I'm a member of.\nQ And in the email dated February 22nd,\nthat he sent to you and John Heater, he\nstates: I want to discuss the path forward for\nACC to engage with members on our response to the\nrange of rail and hazmat policy proposals that are\nbeing discussed.\nDo you understand ACC to refer to the\nAmerican Chemistry Council?",
  "A Yes.\nQ And do you recall whether that discussion\never occurred?\nA I don't specifically recall this\ndiscussion, but we've had many discussions.\nQ And those discussions happened after\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 69\nFebruary 22nd of 2023?\nMS. BROZ: Objection, form.\nA Can you rephrase the question?\nQ Well, have you had discussions with other\npeople at the ACC to -- regarding the response to\nthe range of rail and hazmat policy proposals\nafter February 22nd of 2023?\nMS. BROZ: Objection, form.\nA I know there were discussions in trying to\ndevelop rail hazmat advocacy points for the\nAmerican Chemistry Council and its members.\nQ Okay. And Oxy Vinyls provided input to\nthose?\nA Yes.\nQ Thank you. And did Oxy provide that input\nat the same time that it was a party to the NTSB\ninvestigation?\nA As of February we had not joined the NTSB\ninvestigation.\nQ Right. And so my question is, were there\ndiscussions involving the ACC to develop rail\nhazmat policy advocacy points during the time that\nOxy Vinyls was a party to the NTSB investigation?\nMS. BROZ: Objection, form, foundation.\nA I recall discussions prior to joining the\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 70\nNTSB investigation, but I can tell you today, we\ncontinue to advocate for rail policies within the\nACC. We -- we meet and discuss initiatives with\nthe STB. I testified in 2022 in front of the STB.\nSo there are numerous rail initiative and\nhazardous material discussions that occur, but\nthey in no way conflict with my role or Oxy's role\non the NTSB investigation.\nQ So in those -- strike that.\nSo in Oxy Vinyls' advocacy for rail\npolicies within the ACC, Oxy takes steps to make\nsure that it doesn't conflict with its role in the\nNTSB investigation?\nMS. BROZ: Objection, form. Misstates\ntestimony.\nA Yeah, I mean, I'm not sure how they would\nconflict. I'm not sure I understand what -- what\nyou're asking.\nQ Okay. So I want to show you what's going\nto be marked as Exhibit 6.\nExhibit 6 marked.)\nQ Ms. Stegmann, what is this document?\nA I'm reviewing it to understand.

I believe it was similar to Exhibit 3,\nor related to in some capacity. It looks\nlike communications from a communications group\nregarding a media inquiry.\nQ I want -- I want to direct -- on that\nfirst page, I want to direct your attention to\nthe -- kind of the third paragraph of the email\nfrom Celina Cardenas and it states: Regarding the\nVinyl Institute, Susan Wade, VP of communications,\nhas posted their statement, and through our work\ntogether, has targeted specific news outlets\nlisted below.\nDo you have -- my question is, do you have\nan understanding of what is meant by \"our work\ntogether\"?\nA No, I do not.\nQ And do you have an understanding of how\nthe media outlets were targeted?\nA No, I do not.\nMR. KNIGHT: So by the way, now would be a\nconvenient time to take a break, but I'm happy to\ncontinue. I'm just offering that up.\nMS.

The time is 11:49 a.m.\nQ Ms. Stegmann, I believe earlier you\ntestified that your understanding is that\npolymerizations of vinyl chloride monomer\nconducted by the Oxy PVC plants are suspension\npolymerizations; is that correct?\nA Yes.\nQ Are you familiar with the term \"bulk\npolymerization\"?\nMS. BROZ: Say that again.\nMR. KNIGHT: Bulk polymerization.\nMS. BROZ: Thank you.\nA I don't know if that means dispersion.\nI'm not sure that I understand what you're\nreferencing.\nQ Okay. So we're going to -- I'm going to\nstart asking you some questions about the actual\nEast Palestine derailment.\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 73\nI'm going to show you what's marked -\nwhat's going to be marked as Exhibit 7.\nExhibit 7 marked.)\nQ Just let me know when you're ready.\nA (Reviewing document.)\nI'm ready.\nQ And if you go to the second page, there is\nan email sent on Saturday, February 4th, 2023, at\na.m. from Meghan Achimasi to yourself and\nseveral other people at Oxy. And I want to ask,\nwhat is this email?\nA It was notification that we had cars\ninvolved on a train that derailed in East\nPalestine the night before.\nQ And it says the derailment occurred the\nprevious evening around 8:00 p.m., correct?\nA Yes.\nQ And that would have -- so that would have\nbeen Friday evening, February 3rd?\nA Correct.\nQ Was this the first notification that you\nreceived regarding the derailment?\nA Yes, it was the first one I received.\nQ Okay. And if you would go to page 3 and\nlook at the column Car ID, and it lists the Car\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 74\nIDs TILX 402025, OCPX 80235, OCPX 80179, GATX\nand OCPX 80370.\nAnd sitting here today, do you have an\nunderstanding that these car IDs refer to the five\ntank cars carrying Oxy's VCM that were involved in\nthe East Palestine derailment?\nA Yes, that's my understanding.\nQ And do you have an understanding of who is\nMeghan Achimasi?\nA Yes.\nQ And who is that?\nA Meghan Achimasi is a vice president with\nNorfolk Southern in the sales and marketing group.\nQ And have you spoken with Ms. Achimasi\nbefore?\nA Yes, I have.\nQ Can you give me a general description of\nthe types of communications that you've had with\nher?\nA I've met her at a trade association, a\nnational freight trade association. So it's\ngenerally on the commercial and contractual-type\ndiscussions.\nQ And do you have an understanding of why\nyou were sent this email?\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 75\nA Yes. As a sales and marketing\nrepresentative, she was communicating to her\ncustomer that we had cars involved, and -- and\nthat's customary on quite a significant incident.\nQ And after receiving this email, were you\ninvolved in any internal discussion at Oxy about\nthe derailment between February 4th and February\nth of 2023?\nA Yes.\nQ And did this discussion include how\nshipments of vinyl chloride monomer would be\nimpacted by the derailment from a logistics\nperspective?\nMS. BROZ: Objection, form.\nA Can you ask the question again?\nQ Well, my question is that, did Oxy's\ninternal discussions include discussions of how\nrailcar shipments of vinyl chloride monomer would\nbe impacted by the derailment?\nMS. BROZ: Objection, form.\nA I know there were discussions, but we were\nmore focused on the incident in East Palestine,\nthe response efforts, and the status of our five\nderailed cars.\nQ Between February 4th and February 6th, did\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 76\nyou participate in discussions about what advice\nto give parties on the scene in East Palestine?\nMS. BROZ: Objection, form.\nA Can you rephrase the question, please?\nQ Sure.\nSo you -- you testified that you were\ninvolved in Oxy Vinyls' internal discussions about\nthe derailment, and my question is whether some of\nthose discussions included a discussion about what\nadvice to provide people who were on the scene in\nEast Palestine?\nA Initially those -\nMS. BROZ: Objection, form.\nA Initially those discussions were more\ncentered around about us getting an update and\nunderstanding of the situation in East Palestine.\nIt was based on some of the content shared from NS\nand its contractors that then we began providing\nsome technical insights on the VCM properties.\nQ So I've heard discussions about Oxy\nVinyls' special situations team in Dallas. My\nquestion is, were you a member of the Oxy Vinyls\nspecial situations team in response to this\nderailment?\nA Not formally, and initially, at some point\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 77\nat the end of Saturday night, I was in that room",
  "for a brief period of time because I went to work\nto pick up -- I was traveling the following\nworkday, so I went into the office to pick up some\npapers that I needed for my travel, and they were\nstill meeting, and I just stopped, by but through\nall of Saturday, I was participating remotely like\nmy peers. I was not a designated member of the\nSSP.\nQ So you were not a designated member of the\nSSP, but you participated in some of the",
  "discussions?\nA What I mean \"designated members,\" there's\nfolks that report to the office and they're\ncollecting the information, but as an executive of\nOxyChem, I was calling in as a participant and\nhelping.\nQ When was the first, if you can recall,\ndiscussion that you participated in?\nA On the incident or as part of the SSP?\nQ In the incident.\nA I vividly remember because when I received\nMeghan's email, I was at a gym parking lot ready\nfor a fitness class, and I went to check in and\nget my electronic signature, and that's when I saw\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann",
  "Conducted on January 5, 2024 78\nthe email. So I immediately read it, knew that\nthe likelihood it was a significant incident, and\nI called Mr. Paul Thomas, our vice president of\nhealth, environmental, safety, security.\nI told him I hadn't looked at my emails to\nsee where CHEMTREC was in reporting this, but that\nwe were involved -- we had cars involved in a\nderailment involving vinyl chloride monomer in\nOhio, and that I was headed back home and I would\nnotify our president and send something out to our\nexecutive team.\nAnd so I proceeded home and called our\npresident, and then I put out an email to the\nexecutive team informing them of the\nEast Palestine derailment of the Norfolk Southern\nN train, and that we had five cars involved in\nthe derailment.",
  "Q When was the first -- strike that.\nAfter you sent out that communication, did\nyou participate in any meetings on Saturday in\nconnection with the derailment?\nA Yes. There was a Saturday evening\nconference call and -- on Teams was the media\nformat, and that was a formal call.\nThroughout the day I was talking to people\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 79\nand making phone calls and receiving phone calls,\nbut the actual meeting occurred the early evening,\nor the evening of Saturday, February 4th.\nQ And after that meeting, did you\nparticipate in any other meetings in connection\nwith the derailment on Sunday, February 5th?\nA Yes. There was a morning meeting Sunday,\nFebruary 5th, and then there was an evening\nmeeting on the evening of February 5th, and I\nbelieve there was one Monday morning, February 6th\nthat I participated in.\nQ During any of these meetings, do you\nrecall whether you heard any information that\nresponders in East Palestine were concerned about\nthe risk of polymerization?\nA Yes. That was expressed by the NS\ncontractor Drew McCarty Saturday evening, February\nth, was the first we heard of that, or that I\nheard of it.\nQ During the Monday morning meeting on\nFebruary 5th -\nA What was -- I'm sorry.",
  "Q Strike that.\nOn the Sunday morning meeting on February\nth or the Sunday evening meeting on February 5th\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 80\nor the Monday morning meeting on February 6th, did\nyou learn of any other concerns that the on-scene\nresponders had about the risk of polymerization?",
  "MS. BROZ: Objection, form.\nA Can you repeat the question?\nQ Well, after the Saturday evening call, you\nparticipated in three other meetings through\nMonday morning of February 6th, correct?\nA Yes, three large internal meetings, yes,\nor actually NS was on one of them and its\ncontractors, I think, Sunday morning.\nQ So NS or its contractors were present on\nthe Saturday evening meeting and on the Monday\nmorning meeting?\nA Sunday morning.\nQ Sunday morning meeting, okay. And they\nwere not present on the Sunday evening meeting or\nthe Monday morning meeting; is that correct?\nA Not the meetings I was on, correct.\nQ Okay. And so my question is, on the\nSunday evening meeting on February 5th, do you\nrecall hearing about any concern that the Norfolk\nSouthern or its contractors had about\npolymerization?\nA That is the Sunday evening meeting.\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 81\nQ Yes.\nA I believe, if I remember the timeline\ncorrectly, Steve Smith, our La Porte technical\nmanager, was on scene, and he was -- I believe\nthat is when he was providing an update, so we\nknew that they -- there was a discussion, but NS\nand its contractors themselves expressed those\nconcerns in the prior two meetings.\nQ And did Steve Smith or anyone else relay\nadditional concerns on the Sunday evening meeting?\nMS. BROZ: Objection, form.\nA I don't remember the content of what he\nexpressed. I know he was describing his arrival,\nwho he was meeting with, and discussions, and I\nknow he was getting an update from Drew McCarty\nand met with members of the NTSB when he first\narrived. So I believe that they were voicing\ntheir observations and concerns.\nI think Steve was spending time that\nSunday evening trying to get -- communicate what\nhis view of the scene was and situation.\nQ Same question for the Monday morning\nmeeting.\nA Monday morning was more, you know, we\nwere -- if I remember the timeline correctly, that\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 82\nis when we started hearing about the temperature\nrise and the governor was -- you know, the whole\nprocess.\nI -- I remember specifically on that call\nhe describing what the explosive vent-and-burn\nprocess was going to entail because that was very\nunusual for us, not something us as Oxy were any\nwhat -- familiar with.\nAnd what I vividly remember listening\nintently to, hearing how they were going to\nprepare the site, put the two explosives on each\nrailcar, and direct the flow out of the railcar as\nit was burning, each of the railcars.\nThere were other discussion points, but I\nprobably most vividly remember that discussion.\nQ So in the four meetings that we've\ndiscussed, the Saturday evening call, the Sunday\nmorning call, the Sunday evening call on February\nth, or the Monday morning call on February 6th,\ndo you recall any discussion of Oxy Vinyls' safety\ndata sheet?\nA I don't remember that specifically. I\nthink there were larger topics Drew may have\nbrought up as a reference or somebody may have\nbrought up as a reference, but I don't remember\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 83\nthat specifically. I guess there is other\nelements of the conversation I recall.\nQ Same question, but instead of the safety\nissue, was there any discussion of the emergency\nresponse guide?\nA I do remember that on the Saturday evening\ncall. There may have been follow-up on Sunday\nmorning, but I -- I remember the emergency\nresponse guide being a term used discussing\nSaturday evening.\nQ And you recall what was discussed in\nrelation to the emergency response guide?\nA Yes. Drew McCarty explained to us that\nthey were concerned about a potential BLEVE as a\nresult of polymerization in the railcar, and\nthat -- that is why they had the hot zone,\nevacuation zone of a mile radius, and I just\nremember myself and I would say the tone of our\nleadership team were stunned at the information\nbeing presented to us.\nAnd so the questions evolved around, how\ndo you know a mile is enough. If you really think\nthere is a BLEVE -- and again, this was a shock to\nus, those of us hearing it for the first time.\nAnd so the question really was centered around\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 84\nmaking sure there is modeling, and if you really\nthink that is going to occur, how confident are we\nin a mile radius.\nAnd then subsequently in that discussion,\nand it may have been on the call or a subsequent\ndiscussion afterwards is when I heard the\nemergency response guide referenced, and that is\nwhy there is a mile evacuation zone.\nQ And what was it that was shocking? Was it\nthe mile or some other aspect of what was being\ncommunicated to you?\nA Polymerization, and that there was a\npotential for a BLEVE of these railcars.\nQ So you were really surprised by the\ndiscussion of the potential for a BLEVE?\nA Yes. When we got on the call, that is not\nwhat we were ex- -- I mean, yes.\nQ What were you expecting?\nA An update hearing that the status of the\npressure relief devices venting. You know, we\nheard discussions that the protective housing -\nyou could see the flame, called it a lazy flame,\nyou know, where it is just flaming when there is\nrelease of materials of PRDs.\nI'm not aware of Oxy having any railcars\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 85\nor tanks involved in a BLEVE, so it is the first\ntime we were, in my recollection, dealing with\nthis potential of an incident. And I hadn't heard\nof a BLEVE in any other vinyl chloride monomer\ntank car situation in my 34-year career.\nQ So if you go back to Exhibit 7, if you go\nback to the first page -\nA On Exhibit 7?\nQ Yes.\nA Okay.\nQ That is right. So in the middle of this\npage there is a response sent Saturday, February\nth, at 4:36 p.m. from a Leigh Glass.\nCan you tell me who is Leigh Glass?\nA Yes. Leigh Glass is our rail operations\nmanager.\nQ I apologize. So it is Leigh Glass?\nA Leigh, yes.\nQ And does Leigh Glass report to you?\nA No.\nQ Who does Leigh Glass report to, if you\nknow?\nA She reports to Chuck Tate.\nQ And what is Chuck Tate responsible for?\nA He is manager of transportation,\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 86\noperations and regulatory compliance, so he leads\na group of the operations -- truck operations and\nrail operations group as well as regulatory\nmanager.\nQ So Leigh Glass was writing Meghan Achimasi\nand he writes: Meghan, can you advise if NS plans\nto re-route traffic headed to Pedricktown? It\nsays: We're already tight on inventory and we're\ntrying to evaluate production impact.\nSo my question is, were you aware that -\nstrike that.\nDid you have an understanding that Oxy was\nalready tight on inventory and trying to evaluate\na production impact?\nA I was aware that the inventory shipments\nwere tight, that we were lean on shipments. Was I\naware of this email at this time? No. But it\nwas -- I think it may have been forwarded to me,\nmaybe not, I don't know.\nQ And then Meghan Achimasi responds: Hi,\nLeigh, I'm looking into this and should have an\nanswer for you soon. Our first priority has been\nsafety, allowing the fire to go out and then\ncleaning up the derailment when it's safe to do\nso.\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 87\nDo you recall receiving that particular\npart of the email chain at some point?\nA I may have, or it may have been forwarded\nto me as part of the investigation preparation.\nQ I apologize, let's look at Exhibit 7 just\nfor one more minute. It says, the last sentence,\nMeghan Achimasi's email she sends says: I would\nsay trucking some material in, if that's at all\npossible, is the right thing to do because there\nare likely to be delays.\nMy question is, did -- do you know if Oxy\nVinyls has ever trucked any vinyl chloride monomer\nin response to the East Palestine derailment?\nA No, we did not.\nQ I want to show you what has been marked as\nExhibit 8.\nExhibit 8 marked.)\nQ So this is an email -- this is an email\nfrom Leigh Glass forwarded over to some other\nfolks at Oxy. The subject of it is CERP Level III\nreported.\nAnd I just have some terminology questions\nI was hoping you could help me with. In this\nemail, if you go down to the second email in the\nchain, the one sent on Saturday, February 4th, at\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 88\na.m. It says: A CERP Level III incident\nhas been reported for the following HSE off-site\ntransport sub-incident within Intelex.\nAnd my first question is, what is Intelex?\nA It's our -- it's like a database software\nsystem. So we use it for collecting, documenting\nincidents and follow-up to incidents. It's an\nHESS software system that we utilize.\nQ And the email also refers to CERP, and can\nyou explain what CERP refers to?\nA I'm trying to remember what the incident\nis -- we call all of our transportation incidents\nCERP incidents and whether it's -- whatever mode.\nQ It just means there was an incident?\nA Yes, it's -- and not even -- an incident\nand it can be very minor or obviously -- and\nthat's what the Level III is.\nQ That was my next question, what does Level\nIII mean?\nA It's the highest level of the incidents.\nSo lower level incidents, I wouldn't be copied on.\nIt might just be a minor issue, a sideswipe of two\nrailcars, no product release.\nQ With respect to a Level III incident, did\nyou have particular responsibilities on February\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 89\nrd of 2023?\nMS. BROZ: Objection, form.\nA I think you said -- I'm sorry, can you say\nthat again? You referenced a date and\nresponsibilities. Can you rephrase that?\nQ Sure. So I'm asking about the time of the\nderailment on February 3rd, 2023, and at that\ntime, did you have particular responsibilities at\nOxy Vinyls, should a Level III incident occur?\nA My responsibility's to make sure that the\nsupply team is responding to whatever the CERP\nincident is, and at this point, if you recall in\nan earlier exhibit, I had already received an\nemail from Meghan Achimasi. So I was aware of it\nand had already taken action in notifying others,\nwhich is really just a parallel communication to\nthis process that we have, automated process.\nQ Okay. And I wanted to get your\nunderstanding of the various parts of Oxy's\nresponse to the derailment. One aspect, if I\nunderstand, was to form a special response team in\nDallas.\nAnd you described the existence and said\nyou weren't a formal part of it, but participated\nin some of the discussions; is that fair?\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 90\nA I think I'm a formal part, in that I'm\ngoing to be updated from the SSP. When I say \"not\nformal,\" I didn't respond to the corporate office.\nMy old position and my direct report, Christi\nYoung, did to represent supply chain.\nMy formal obligation was then to be\ncalling in and checking in and asking questions of\nthe supply chain to assist in making sure we had\nresources available.\nQ And I've also heard there was a strike\nteam in Houston. Did such a thing exist?\nA We -- we referenced an emergency response\nteam as a strike team in the past. I don't know\nthat it exists today, but again, we -- we did\ndispatch representatives, so I -- I think the\nstrike team may be there's an emergency response\nteam in Houston.\nQ And are they the ones -- is there a\nconnection between those folks and the people that\nwere sent from Oxy Vinyls to East Palestine, Ohio?\nMS. BROZ: Objection, form.\nA I believe Justin Cox was dispatched, and I\nbelieve he's part of the Houston emergency\nresponse team.\nQ Okay.\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 91\nA I believe they call the group Emergency\nServices.\nQ And you mentioned that Oxy Vinyls sent\nlike a team to East Palestine, Ohio, correct?\nA Yes.\nQ And between February 4th and February 6th,\ndid you yourself have any -- participate in any\ncommunications with the team in East Palestine?\nA Not directly, only on the conference calls\nwhere they were providing updates.\nQ And that was like the Sunday evening call\nand the Monday morning call?\nA The Sunday evening and the Monday morning,\ncorrect.\nQ So I'm going to show you what's now going\nto be marked as I guess Exhibit 9. It's Tab 78.\nExhibit 9 marked.)\nQ And when you're ready, tell me what it is.\nA It is an email from Robyn Kinsley from the\nChlorine Institute.\nQ And who is Robyn Kinsley?\nA She's the vice president of transportation\nand emergency response. I know she's a leader in\nthe Chlorine Institute.\nQ And this email is sent on Saturday,\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 92\nFebruary 4th, 2023, at 10:38 a.m., correct?\nA I'm assuming the date and time are\ncorrect, yes.\nQ Okay. So it looks like Drew McCarty of\nSPSI had been communicating with Robyn Kinsley, is\nwhat I would take from this email. And the\nquestion I have is, is the Chlorine Institute a\ngood resource for information about vinyl chloride\nmonomer?\nMR. GOMEZ: Objection.\nMS. BROZ: You can go ahead and answer.\nMR. GOMEZ: You can answer.\nA Okay. I don't know that I'm supposed to\njudge the Chlorine Institute, but they are a\ntechnical organization and they had a -- helped\ndevelop a pamphlet since a wide use of chlorine is\nused in vinyl chloride. So we use them as a -\nthe membership uses them as a technical\norganization.\nQ So Oxy Vinyls is a member of the Chlorine\nInstitute?\nA Oxy is.\nQ Oxy?\nA Yes.\nQ And do you yourself have a role at Oxy\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 93\nwith the Chlorine Institute?\nA Not a strong role. I have reached out and\ntalked to Robyn Kinsley in the past and so I will\ninteract on transportation-related questions or\nadvocacy or concerns.\nQ In the -- and do you recall whether\nyourself or anyone else ever reached out to -\nstrike that.\nThe bottom of the email, the last sentence\nfrom Robyn Kinsley states that: Drew said feel\nfree to give him a call to find out more details.\nAnd my question is, do you know whether\nsomeone from Oxy reached out to find out more\ndetails?\nA I'm surprised this Drew went to -- from\nSPSI went directly to Robyn. That may be a great\nresource, but I know that he knows Oxy folks such\nas Tim Kelly. And I know that Tim Kelly and Drew\nMcCarty were in communication as of Saturday\nevening and before, because I heard from Tim Kelly\nand others that they were in communications with\nDrew McCarty.\nSo I can't say who reached out to who, but\nI know that I was aware of the company SPSI. I\ndon't know a lot about them, but I've heard the\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM",

  "Conducted on January 5, 2024 94\nname before and I know that they were in\ncommunication Saturday.\nQ It looks like they were -- looks like Drew\nMcCarty was in communication with the Chlorine\nInstitute on Saturday morning, correct?\nA That is what this appears.\nQ Within a few hours plus or minus of when\nyou first received a notification that there had\nbeen a derailment?\nA Right. So at 8:40 was our first\nnotification, and I don't know what our Eastern\nStandard or times or -- I know there's been\nvarious time zones used in some emails but -- but\nI think to be clear, Drew McCarty was, my\nunderstanding, an NS contractor in this role.\nQ So I wanted to kind of move past the\nvent-and-burn event in East Palestine and just ask\nyou some questions about what happened after the\nvent-and-burn.\nSo can you describe your responsibilities\nin relation to the derailment following the\nvent-and-burn on February 6th?\nMS. BROZ: Objection, form.\nA Can you be more specific? I mean, I\nhave -\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 95\nQ Sure. You had a responsibility at some\npoint as a party representative to the NTSB,\ncorrect?\nA We didn't join the NTSB investigation\nuntil March 17th.\nQ Okay. And you had -- did you have\nresponsibility in connection with -- with\ngovernment affairs at Oxy Vinyls?\nMS. BROZ: Objection, form.\nA I wasn't working on any of the advocacy\ninitiatives for a period of time. I know I wasn't\ninitially for the first couple of weeks, no.\nQ But later you were involved, correct?\nMS. BROZ: Objection, form.\nA I was copied on some emails and if -\nmaybe asked to review a document, but that wasn't\nmy primary role. Communications and government\naffairs rolled under Paul Thomas at the time.\nQ So other than being a party that were on\nthe NTSB hazardous materials group and the role\nyou've -- limited role you've described with\nrespect to -\nMS. BROZ: Can you read that back?",
  "I can't hear what you're saying.\nRecord read.)\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 96\nMS. BROZ: Okay. You want to start again?\nI apologize for interrupting you. I just can't\nhear you.\nQ I'll speak up.\nMS. BROZ: Thank you.\nMR. KNIGHT: Certainly, and I apologize\nfor that.\nQ Other than your NTSB role and the limited\nmedia role that you described, did you have any\nother role in relation to the derailment after\nFebruary 6th?",
  "MS. BROZ: Objection, form, misstates\ntestimony.\nA Can you be more specific?\nQ Well, I really can't, because I'm trying\nto discover what your various roles were, and I\ndon't know what all they may have been.\nA Related to?\nQ The derailment.\nA Initially our response was ensuring that\nwe were responsive to my organization, or my team\nwas responsive to the FRA request, the NTSB\nrequest, PHMSA request, and providing any\ntechnical information that was requested from the\nvarious organizations.\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 97\nSo that was a major effort to make sure\nthat we had the teams and the folks aligned, so\nthat was really a focus. Obviously I had other\nresponsibilities outside the derailment.\nThen as -- at some point late probably in\nMarch -- early March, maybe late February, as\nthere were media updates regarding this incident,\nit became clear to Oxy that we needed to consider\nbeing part of the NTSB investigation to correct\nthe narrative that was being played out in the\nmedia. That misinformation was being\ncommunicated, or information that was not clear to\nus as being technically correct.\nAnd so I was asked to evaluate or\nunderstand, learn more about the NTSB organization\nbecause we had not been a party to their\ninvestigation. We weren't very familiar with the\norganization.\nAnd so I eventually reached out or got\nconnected with Sarah Puro at the NTSB, and there\nwas an effort in figuring out and then",
  "recommending a meeting and joining the NTSB\ninvestigation.\nQ So you mentioned one entity. I just\nwanted to make sure I understood. You said FNSA?\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 98\nA PHMSA.\nQ What is that?\nA It is the Pipeline Hazardous Materials\nSafety Association, so they're in the Department\nof Transportation. So Bill Schoonover is the\nassociate director, I believe.\nQ And you stated that there was\nmisinformation in the media that caused Occidental\nto become interested in becoming part of the NTSB\nprocess; is that fair?\nA There was -- yes, yes.\nQ Okay. And could you just tell me a little",
  "bit about what that misinformation was?\nA I specifically remember the video that\ncirculated on February 23rd, I believe that is the\ncorrect date. I remember seeing Karl Alexy, Randy\nKeltz of the FRA touring the East Palestine\nderailment scene and Randy speaking about, well,\nthere was polymerization occurring. He's a\nfederal government employee with the FRA speaking\nabout polymerization.\nIf you look, Chair Homendy and Robert Hall\ndid a press conference, I believe it was that same\ntime period, and I remember Robert Hall stepping\nup to the podium, talking about polymerization.\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 99\nSo we had very high-level government folks\nmaking statements that we then realized that we\nhad to assess the technical ability to.\nQ So in your -- what you view as information\nabout polymerization, did you have a view that\nthat was detrimental to Oxy Vinyls?",
  "MS. BROZ: Objection, form.\nA I think we wanted facts, and I expect the\nmedia and if our government agencies are\nconducting media statements that facts are\npresented, and there were statements there that we\ndidn't understand.\nQ So my question was, would that information\nbe detrimental to Oxy Vinyls?",
  "MS. BROZ: Objection, form, asked and\nanswered.\nA Again, I think our -- our concern was that\nfacts be presented in this investigation as we\nunderstood the mission of the NTSB to be. And\nthere were a lot of -- I mean, you demonstrated\nsome exhibits to me, a lot of media outlets. And\nso at this point we recognized that Oxy should be\na part of the NTSB investigation.\nIf you look, no other shipper was, no\nother customer of the NS, and there were many\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 100\ncustomers impacted by the NS derailment. There\nwere many shippers that had cars breached that\nleaked chemicals into the environment, and they\nwere not part of the investigative hearing.\nIt has been a considerable resource\nrequirement of Oxy in considering my time. So we",
  "didn't enter lightly, but it was obvious that it\nwas a necessity for us to join to make sure facts\nare presented as facts regarding VCM chemical\nproperties.\nQ So it was -\nA And the safe transportation of vinyl\nchloride monomer.\nQ So it was important to Oxy Vinyls to get\nthe facts about vinyl chloride monomer correct in\nthe NTSB process; is that correct?\nA I think as we joined the investigation, it\nhas been important to make sure there are facts\npresented accurately.\nQ And why is that important to Oxy?\nA Because we're a compliant, authentic,\ngenuine company that works off of data and facts.\nQ And if incorrect facts were to be\nperpetuated through the NTSB process, that could\nbe detrimental to Oxy Vinyls, correct?\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 101",
  "MS. BROZ: Objection, form.\nA I don't know why -- I mean, the NTSB\nobviously wanted us to be part of the\ninvestigation, and so, again, I think we're all\nhere to advance transportation safety based off of\nfacts.\nQ Let me ask you about the derailed Oxy tank\ncars after the vent-and-burn in East Palestine.\nDo you have any familiarity with the\nsampling -- strike that.\nDo you have any familiarity with whether\nsamples were taken by Oxy Vinyls from those\nderailed tank cars?\nA I guess I would like to understand what I\ncan answer as being part of the NTSB\ninvestigation.\nMS.

I can't describe\neach sample and the number of samples in the exact\nlocation, but I know that they were taken from the\nrailcar.\nQ Okay. And do you know where the railcars\nwere located when those samples were taken?\nA I believe they were in the derailment\nsituation, but I didn't follow that portion that\nclosely.\nQ So you think they were in the\nEast Palestine?\nA Oh, yes, yes.\nQ Okay.\nA Yes.\nQ Do you have an understanding of what\nultimately happened to the derailed tank cars\nafter the vent-and-burn?\nA What -- I guess a little bit more clarity\nin what you're asking as far as what happened.\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 103\nQ Sure. Well, at some point, were the tank\ncars removed from East Palestine, Ohio?\nA I know they were removed from the tracks.\nWhere they are in exact location, yes, I know that\nthere is a -- they were cleaning up the sites and\nthey moved railcars off.\nQ And do you know where those railcars were\nmoved off to?\nA No.\nQ Do you know whether the railcars still\nexist or not?\nA No. I don't know if they have been cut up\nor -- yeah -\nQ And -\nA -- addressed.\nQ And do you know whether any samples of -\nstrike that.\nDo you know whether -- do you know whether\nany samples were taken by Oxy Vinyls after the\nrailcars were removed and taken off from\nEast Palestine, Ohio?\nA I think all the samples were taken at the\ntime, and retains were -- samples plus retains.\nQ So you have no knowledge if Oxy will\nconduct any further sampling of the tank car,\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 104\ncorrect?\nA Correct.\nMS.

We\ndid not notice your deposition, but since you're\nhere and you're appearing and kind enough to\nanswer questions, I have a few for you today.\nMy allotment of time is limited to an\nhour. I hope to be shorter than that, but if I'm\nmoving quickly, it's just out of respect of that\none hour allotment, okay?\nA Okay, thank you.\nQ Also, by virtue of kind of going second,\nit will seem like I'm jumping around from topic to\ntopic. That is just by virtue of the way it is, I\nthink, going second, so I don't mean to confuse\nyou or kind of move off track.\nIf at any point in time, what I'm asking\ndoesn't make sense, you need to clarify it,\nwhatever the case might be, I want to make sure\nyou understand the question. Just let me know,\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 106\nokay?\nA Okay.\nQ Before I get into some of the topics that\nI have prepared to discuss with you today, I do\nwant to revisit some of the things you discussed\nwith counsel.\nFirst, do you recall being asked a series\nof questions about the expectations of Oxy Vinyls,\nspecifically expectations of rail carriers as\nshipping Oxy Vinyls' products?\nA I don't -- I think he asked, but I\ndon't -- I wouldn't be able to rephrase the\nquestion.\nQ Fair enough. But you remember generally a\ndiscussion -\nA Yes.\nQ -- about what those expectations would be,\nright?\nA Yes.\nQ And I think you testified that one of the\nexpectations is that rail carriers, Norfolk\nSouthern included, would safely ship Oxy Vinyls'\nproducts throughout the country, right?\nA Correct.\nQ Would you agree that in terms of Class I\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 107\nrailroads that ship freight throughout the\ncountry, there's limited competition?\nA Correct, there is limited competition.\nQ Another way of saying that is, there's not\nvery many choices for a shipper like Oxy, right?\nA Not many rail shipping options, correct.\nQ Yes, I'm just referring to rail shipment\nright now.\nA Yes.\nQ And that's especially true as you go from\nregion to region throughout the United States,\nright?\nA It's really through all the United States.\nYou have two Eastern Coast carriers, Norfolk\nSouthern and CSX, and two West Coast shippers,\nwhich is typically BNSF or Union Pacific.\nQ So in the case of Oxy shipping from any of\nits locations, let's say, in Texas to the East\nCoast, there's really only two choices?\nA At the destination on the East Coast,\nthat's correct, and obviously sometimes you have\nshort line railroads that are the delivering\ncarrier but the main haul is one of two eastern\ncarriers.\nQ So just referring to those two main\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 108\neastern carriers, I think you said it's Norfolk\nSouthern and CSX?\nA CSX.\nQ So is it fair to say that Oxy expects that\nin exchange for that kind of exclusivity, that\nthey're going to do a good job with shipping its\nproduct?\nA I think that's fair of what the shipping\nindustry expects, is that our customer -- shipping\nindustry, that you expect, whether there's\ncompetition or not, that the carriers are going to\nperform safely.\nQ But certainly if you don't have much of a\nchoice, right, there's all the more reason for\nthem to exercise the utmost safety in what they're\ndoing, right?\nA I think regardless of competition or not,\nthey need to exercise compliance with safety and\nenvironmental regulations as well as performance.\nQ Fair enough. But it's not like you have\nmuch choice if in this case Norfolk Southern isn't\nshipping your product via the rail in the safest\nmanner, right?\nA Correct. The significant portion of our\nline haul or origin destination points are closed,\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 109\nmeaning there's only one carrier that can perform\nthat transportation shipment.\nQ And in this case, at least going from\nLa Porte to the facility in New Jersey, that's\nNorfolk Southern, right?\nA Actually, CSX can deliver to the\nNew Jersey area and then it's delivered by\nConrail.\nQ Okay. Understood. But I think you said,\nand maybe this plays into what you talked about\nearlier, that at some point Norfolk Southern won\nover Oxy's business over CSX in that respect,\nright?\nA Correct.\nQ Fair to say that as part of winning that\nbusiness, there were representations made about\nshipping the product safely?\nA Yes. Until this incident, we've had a\ngood shipping history performance with the NS, and\nso they have been a carrier that performed.\nQ And as vice president of supply chain for\nOxy, has this incident changed your perspective on\nthe safety that Norfolk Southern employs in\nshipping Oxy's products?\nA Can you repeat that question?\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 110\nQ Sure.\nAs vice president of supply chain for Oxy,\nhas this incident, the derailment in\nEast Palestine, changed what you understand to be\nthe way that Norfolk Southern supposedly safely\ntransports your product to the East Coast?\nA I think we have learned a lot more through\nthe investigation process about what it takes to\nsafely transport product and the response to an\nincident, and I'll be honest, I think we're\ndisappointed in NS's response.\nQ What are you specifically disappointed in?\nWhen I say \"you,\" I mean Oxy.\nA When I say Oxy disappoint -- I mean, the\nresponse, the immediate response to the incident,\nand I think from those phone conversations, having\nmore leadership, and what were the checkpoints and\nknowledge of their executives, and what was a -\ndecision-making controls.\nIt appeared that the contractors had a lot\nof leeway in the decision-making process.\nQ You were also asked some questions about\nthe polymerization reaction and the process that\nOxy employs at various facilities.\nDo you recall generally that line of\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 111\nquestioning?\nA Yes.\nQ And I think you said it's been some time\nsince you had direct involvement with those\nprocesses, right?\nA Correct, over a decade.\nQ And I don't want to test your memory on\nthis -\nA Thank you.\nQ -- the specifics of that again. But I do\nwant to focus on -- on one kind of segment, and\nthat is the reaction temperature that you were\nasked about.\nDo you recall generally those questions?\nA Yes.\nQ And correct me if I'm wrong, I think you\nwere asked a question about whether that reaction\ntemperature, again the reaction for polymerization\nof vinyl chloride, in those facilities takes place\nat less than 150 degrees Fahrenheit.\nDo you remember that?\nA I remember that question, yes.\nQ And I believe you said that yes, it does,\nright?\nA Yes.\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 112\nQ But that's in the presence of an\ninitiator, right?\nA Absolutely.\nQ That's not the application of heat alone,\nright?\nA Correct.\nQ So we're not to take your testimony\nearlier today to suggest that Oxy applies 150\ndegrees of heat to vinyl chloride monomer, and all\nof a sudden it polymerizes, right?\nA Correct. I apologize if that's what was\ninterpreted, but when you react vinyl chloride in\na suspension process with water, you are adding\norganic peroxides, initiators, to initiate the\nreaction, and then you're heating up the reaction.\nBut it's in the presence of initiators.\nQ And that's significant for stabilized\nvinyl chloride monomer because stabilized vinyl\nchloride monomer doesn't have those initiators\npresent, right?\nA Correct.\nQ I promised you I was going to jump around,\nso I'm going to jump around.\nYou discussed with counsel a little\nearlier today the derailment in Paulsboro,\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 113\nNew Jersey. Do you remember that?\nA Yes.\nQ Paulsboro is just outside of Philadelphia,\nright?\nA Correct.\nQ Major metropolitan city?\nA Yes.\nQ And that derailment occurred November of\nright?\nA Yes.\nQ And you had just stepped into the role of\ndirector of supply chain?\nA Correct.\nQ So fairly significant event that occurred\nshortly after you entered into or transitioned\ninto a new significant role at Oxy, right?\nA Correct.\nQ And I know you said that your involvement\nwas not as, I don't want to put words in your\nmouth, but as significant or direct, what have\nyou, because you were closing on a house, right?\nA Correct. I would have been responding in\nthe SSP room directly for that derailment\nincident. I was called to, but I was in closing\nand so somebody else performed that role.\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 114\nQ So with the understanding that you may not\nhave had as much direct involvement as you would\ntypically have in your role as director of supply\nchain, what can you tell me that you recall about\nany technical assistance that Oxy provided for the\nPaulsboro derailment?\nA Yes, so I know that Tom Woodka, who was a\nPedricktown plant manager at the time, went to\nmeetings and went to the scene. They did not\nappear to need direct help at -- in handling the\nincident, but he was available and also eyes for\nOxy to communicate what was occurring.\nAnd, again, you hear a lot on the news\nmedia, but you also like to have a person present\nto see the actual results and what's occurring,\nthe actual events unfolding.\nThe only other area of concern that I\nremember hearing about was, I believe the Coast\nGuard was involved because the vinyl chloride\nmonomer railcar was in a waterway, and there was\nsome thoughts about how to handle that car and the\nrelease of vinyl chloride as it relates to the\nwater, the way it released.\nAnd so there was -- what I just recall is\nthat the Coast Guard doesn't typically have that\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 115\nkind of response -- responsibilities, and so that\nadded to some confusion.\nQ And with that kind of added element of the\nCoast Guard being involved, was there any, to your\nknowledge, interfacing between Oxy and Coast\nGuard?\nA I don't think so. I just -- I just\nremember that from the incident and the general\ndiscussions, but I can't speak to anything other\nthan Tom Woodka being at times on scene.\nQ Okay. I'm going to ask you a few more\nquestions about it, again with the understanding\nthat you may not have been as directly involved,\nokay?\nA Okay.\nQ Are you aware that in connection with the\nPaulsboro derailment, the line that the train was\nrunning on was a shared line between Conrail and\nNorfolk Southern?\nA I know it was a Conrail line, and I know\nConrail is a joint ownership between CSX and NS.\nQ Okay. And do you recall any involvement\ninteractions between the folks at Oxy and Norfolk\nSouthern specifically with respect to the\nPaulsboro derailment back in 2012?\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 116\nA No, I do not.\nQ Do you recall -\nA I would state -\nQ Oh, I'm sorry.\nA -- that NS, Norfolk Southern, was not\ncarrying our VCM at that time.\nQ It was on a different carrier?\nA It was on the CSX.\nQ Understood.\nDo you have any recollection of whether\nthere was an incident or a Unified Command set up\nfor that derailment?\nA I do believe there was.\nQ And was the railroad, whether it was\nConrail, CSX, Norfolk Southern, were they part of\nthat Unified Command?\nA I don't recall specifically.\nQ And if you don't know or you don't recall,\nthat is totally fine with me.\nA Yes, yep.\nQ Do you recall any specifics about\ninteractions between Oxy and the railroad in\nconnection with the Paulsboro derailment, whether\nit is CSX, Conrail, or NS?\nA Yes. I remember Dean Pisani, the vice\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 117\npresident of sales and marketing, reaching out to\nthe Oxy vice president at the time, Robin Burns,\nphone call to communicate that the incident and\nthere was some key notations, much like Meghan\nAchimasi reached out to me by email notifying me,\nwhich is typical in that kind of event and just\nopening those lines of communications.\nMR. GOMEZ: What exhibit are we up to?\nCOURT REPORTER: 10.\nQ Ms. Stegmann, I'm going to hand you\ndocument that we're going to mark as Exhibit 10 to\nyour deposition. And please forgive me, I am a\none-man show today, so this is going to take a\nlittle bit longer than it would normally take.\nOnce that's been marked, please take a\nlook at it. I'm going to have a few questions\nonce you've had a chance to review it, and in the\ninterim I will load these up so that all the other\ncounsel will have a copy.\nExhibit 10 marked.)\nA (Reviewing document.) Okay, I've read the\ndocument.\nQ Great, thank you. This document, what",
  "we've marked as Exhibit 10 to your deposition, it\nappears to be an email thread that originates,\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 118\nlet's see, if we look at the bottom email, July\nth, 2023; is that fair?\nA Correct.\nQ And the first email in the thread, which\nagain, appears at the bottom of the first page,\nand it heads on to the second page, is from Celina\nCardenas; is that right?\nA Correct.\nQ And in that long list of recipients, you\nare listed as one of the recipients, right?\nA Correct.\nQ These -- this email that we're looking at,\nspecifically the July 25th email from\nMs. Cardenas, it appears to be forwarding links to\nseveral media pieces or articles that might be of\ninterest to the team; is that a fair\ncharacterization?\nA Yes.\nQ And one of the articles that is referenced\nthere in the bullet point on the second page is\nOhio train derailment article. Do you see that?\nA I do.\nQ Okay. Now, looking at the -- the next\nemail in the thread, it looks like that is from\nWade Alleman -- is that how you pronounce the\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 119\nname?\nA Alleman.\nQ Alleman. And, again, please remind me who\nWade Alleman is.\nA Now or at the time of the derailment?\nQ Great question. At the time of the",
  "derailment.\nA At the time of the derailment, he was\nthe -- is the senior vice president of business\nand development.\nQ And do you report to him?\nA At that time I did.\nQ Okay. Understood. And with respect to\nthis email at least, all my questions are focused\non this time frame.\nA Okay.\nQ Okay. And his response is later that day,\nright, it looks like?\nA Yes.\nQ And if we look at what he says, it reads:\nNote, buried in the articles is the Paulsboro VCM\ntrain derailment from 11 years ago.\nDo you see that?\nA I do.\nQ That is the derailment that we have just\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 120\nbeen discussing, right?\nA Correct.\nQ It goes on to say: For those not\ninvolved, similar event. The train ran through\nthe small bridge/track that was not properly\nlatched (as I think I remember) which caused\nderailment and gash in our VCM car and several\nsprawled over the track.\nDid I read that correctly?\nA Yes, you did.\nQ And I think that is consistent with what\nyou recalled earlier today that there was one VCM\ncar that was breached, right?\nA Correct.\nQ And the email goes on to say: No fire.\nIf I remember correctly, we provided some\ntechnical advisor service, and they had some dumb\nideas that we steered them from.\nDid I read that correctly?\nA Yes.\nQ The paragraph finishes: It did not get\nnear the political press the latest one is\ngetting, right?\nA Correct.\nQ I want to focus on that second-to-last\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 121\nsentence that we've just been discussing. No\nfire. If I remember correctly, we provided some\ntechnical advisor service.\nThe reference in what I just read to\ntechnical advisor service, do you have any\nrecollection of what that technical advisor\nservice was specifically?\nA I don't know specifically, but I believe\nthat is why we had Tom Woodka, the local plant\nmanager, on the scene, and then if there was\nquestions, he could come back just like we had\nwith Steve Smith and have access to our technical\ncommunity.\nQ Okay. And that -- that same sentence goes\non to say: They had some dumb ideas that we\nsteered them from.\nDo you see that?\nA Yes.\nQ Now, I understand that you did not write\nthis email, but as a recipient, do you know who\nthe \"they\" are that was referenced in that\nsentence?\nA Not specifically.\nQ Do you have -- can you surmise at all who\nthat may have been, based on your experience at\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 122\nOxy at the time?\nA \"They\" being some of the responders\ninvolved in the Paulsboro incident. I know in\ncontext it was related to the response ideas, and\nthat is why I brought up the Coast Guard and\npossibly handling of the event. Because -\nbecause it was a waterway, if I recall correctly,\nthey were like a lead -- lead agency in the\neffort.\nQ Okay. And I think you picked up where I\nwas going on this. There is a reference to,\nquote, dumb ideas. Do you see that?\nA Yes.\nQ And steering -- and steering them, whoever\nthey are, away from dumb ideas, right?\nA I see that reference.\nQ Do you know what the dumb ideas are that\nare being referenced here?\nA Not specifically that I could discuss in\nany detail.\nQ Fair enough. One of the response efforts\nin Paulsboro was implementing an evacuation zone.\nAre you familiar with that?\nA Just -- that would make sense. I don't\nknow why -- you know, I know East Palestine was a\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 123\nmile, and they talked about structures. I don't\nremember the details from that long ago.\nQ And understanding that you may not recall\nthose details, does it sound familiar that the\nevacuation zone was 12 miles?\nA I don't recall that, to be honest.\nQ And does it sound familiar that the\nevacuation zone was implemented for three days?\nA I do know it was multiple days.\nQ And was all concerning one breached vinyl\nchloride monomer car, right?\nA Yes.\nQ And if we fast forward to East Palestine,\nthe evacuation zone that was implemented by NS and\nits contractors was one mile, right?\nA I do recall the one mile based on the\nemergency response guide.\nQ Okay. And that is one mile for a town of\nroughly 5,000 people, right?\nA Correct. That's my understanding of the\npopulation.\nQ And that was -- those were some of the\nfactors that Oxy was considering when they were\npresented by NS and its contractors with the idea\nof an evacuation zone, and I think you said it was\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 124\nkind of shocking, right?\nA I don't -- I don't want to imply that it\nwas one mile versus a 12-mile related to this\nincident. I think what was shocking to us was the\nreporting of a potential BLEVE and then our\nfamiliarity with what the appropriate evacuation\nzone is relative to a BLEVE.\nAnd I think after it was presented, we\nunderstood that a mile, based on the emergency\nresponse guide, is a standard, but again, when we\nfirst heard of it, it just seemed concerning.\nQ Okay. So if I understand correctly, what\nwas concerning was the idea that you're being\npresented with the potential for a BLEVE, and at\nthe same time, the evacuation zone that was at\nleast presented at that point in time was limited\nto one mile?\nA Correct.\nQ And that, at least at first, did not\nstrike you as consistent?\nA Correct.\nQ Because a BLEVE is a major explosion?\nA Yes, an uncontrolled catastrophic\nexplosion.\nQ With a resulting release of the lading in\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 125\nthe car, right?\nA Right, and shrapnel flying.\nQ And there were five cars that were\nimplicated at the time, right?\nA We had five cars in the derailment, yes.\nQ I want to switch gears and put that aside,\nplease.\nI'm going to mark as Exhibit 11 another\ndocument to your deposition. Again, just take a\nlook at that while I queue this up for everybody,\nand I will have some questions for you.\nExhibit 11 marked.)\nA Yes. This is a repeat document from\nearlier today.\nQ Oh, I'm sorry, we marked this already. We\ncan just reference it -- I think it's Exhibit 9,\nright?\nA Here is 11, and it was 9 before, yes.\nQ Okay. So we're going to pretend like 11\nhasn't been marked. If you can just hand that\nback, we'll use 9, and we will reuse that sticker.\nThank you for that.\nBut you were asked some questions about\nthis earlier, right?\nA Yes.\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 126\nQ You were asked about, I believe, the",
  "Chlorine Institute, right?\nA I was asked some questions about the\nChlorine Institute, that is correct.\nQ And again, just please correct me if I'm\nwrong, one of the things you mentioned was being\nsomewhat surprised that Drew McCarty from SPSI was\ncommunicating with the Chlorine Institute when he\nhad a direct line to certain folks at Oxy, right?\nA Yeah. Just the timing. I mean, it was\nvery soon. If he was corresponding to both, that\nis great, but yes, I just -- it's kind of\nsurprising when we -- when I received this.\nQ The Chlorine Institute didn't manufacture\nthe VCM that was in the five railcars in\nEast Palestine, right?\nA No, they did not.\nQ That was Oxy's product, correct?\nA Correct.\nQ Oxy is the expert in its own products,\nright?\nA Correct.\nQ If we look at this email that was marked\nas Exhibit 9 -- well, first of all, it looks to be\na forward of Robyn Kinsley's email, right?\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 127\nA Correct.\nQ And the forward was from John Brennan to\nyou and Paul Thomas on February 4, 2023, at\np.m., right?\nA Correct.\nQ Who is John Brennan?\nA John Brennan is our senior vice president\nof manufacturing.\nQ John Brennan also participated in the\nconversations with Norfolk Southern and its\ncontractors regarding the technical advice that\nwas being provided by the team in Dallas, right?\nA I know he was there, yes, and I know\nspecifically he was on Sunday morning's call. I\ndo not recall if he was on Saturday night.\nQ That Sunday morning call that you\nreferenced is the one where John Brennan was\nadamant that polymerization wasn't occurring,\nright?\nA Yes. He responded with a clear\nconviction.\nQ Let's look at the email that Mr. Brennan\nforwarded to you.\nA He also was our Chlorine Institute\nrepresentative for many years.\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 128\nQ Oh, okay. What's the significance of\nthat, or what does it mean?\nA I'm just saying, I know he represented us\non I guess a higher level committee, maybe the\nboard committee.\nQ Okay, understood. Thank you.\nA Yes.\nQ So looking at the email, it reads: I just\nspoke with Drew McCarty from SPSI.\nRight?\nA Yes.\nQ And I don't want to read the whole thing,\nbut there's a reference as we keep going that they\nspotted all five VCM cars, right?\nA Yes.\nQ It goes on to say: He was talking fast\nbut here's what I gathered about the five cars.\nThree are burning from the protective housing, one\nis jetting flame out of the PRD and has serious\nheat impingement, and one is experiencing heat\nimpingement sitting between two other different\nproducts -- or different product cars that are on\nfire.\nCorrect?\nA Yes.\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 129\nQ This is sent at 10:38 a.m., Saturday,\nFebruary 4th, right?\nA Yes.\nQ The email goes on to say: None of the\ntank cars have split.\nRight?\nA Yet.\nQ Yet, I'm sorry. None of the tank cars\nhave split yet?\nA Correct.\nQ And: It took some effort by SPSI and NS\nto get the fire responders farther out from the\nhot zone.\nRight?\nA Correct.\nQ And then at least according to this email,\nDrew McCarty believed that all were starting to\ncalm down, right?\nA Correct. Well, they say \"they,\" so\nit's -- it would seem like it's Drew since he\nspoke to Drew, but...\nQ Okay. And that their plan, whoever\ntheir\" is, is to hot tap and liquid flare all\nbefore they can polymerize.\nDo you see that?\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 130\nA Yes.\nQ So there was -- let me withdraw that.\nHaving received this email on February\nth, 2023, and looking at it now, is it your\nunderstanding that SPSI, and specifically Drew\nMcCarty, was concerned about polymerization as\nearly as 10:38 in the morning on February 4th,\nA Yes.\nQ And as you sit here today, having been\ninvolved in the special situations team and\ninvolved in any other investigations, fair to say\nthat there was no data at 10:38 a.m. on February\nth, 2023, to support any conclusion that\npolymerization was occurring in the VCM cars,\nright?\nA We are -- I'm not -- we are not aware of\nany data that was available at 10:38 to support\nthat polymerization was a concern.\nQ Do you have any idea how at 10:38 a.m. on\nFebruary 4th, 2023, Drew McCarty came to start\nthinking about polymerization if there was no data\nto support that?\nA Only from the statements that they shared\nin East Palestine in that public hearing.\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 131\nQ The hearings held by the NTSB, that's what\nyou're referring to?\nA Yes.\nQ What statements specifically, if I might\nask?\nA I'm just saying that through that\nprocess and -- and also on our phone calls, he\nstated that they relied -- I know on our one phone\ncall that he relied on his training. I remember\nhearing the training, Pueblo, Colorado.\nAnd I know Drew's focus -- he heard our\ndiscussions Saturday night and then Sunday\nmorning, and again, I think Saturday night was, I\nhear that you don't think polymerization is a\nconcern but that doesn't agree with our training.\nAnd he and Chip Day kept referencing the\ntraining that they received, and I think that they\ncategorized monomers as a generic class of\nchemicals, \"monomers\" meaning styrene and other\nmonomers.\nAnd \"monomers\" is a generic term, and each\nhas its own chemical properties and\ncharacteristics and how they're stabilized and\nwhat their reaction potential and end product is.\nQ To put a fine point on it, you can't treat\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 132\nall monomers the same in an emergency response\nsituation, right?\nA Yes, well said. And that would be my\nview. I mean, I think -- but what he was saying\nis he got general monomer training and that's\nhow -- I think that's how they approached it.\nWell -- yeah, that would be my view.\nQ So, again, correct me if I'm wrong with\nthis, am I to take what you just said, that they,\nbeing Chip Day and Drew McCarty, put, in your -\nto your mind, put their training over the advice\nthat Oxy was giving them?\nA That is my viewpoint that I walked away\nfrom the phone calls, and then as the actions\nplayed out, that's how I view the situation.",
  "Q I want to go back to some of the facts\nthat are -- that are put forward in this -- in\nthis email here. Again, we're talking about a\nconversation that, by the looks of this email,\ntook place before 10:38 Saturday, February 4th,\nright?\nA Right, and we were notified at 8:40.\nQ And, again, there's a concern at that\npoint from folks, including Drew McCarty, about\npolymerization, right?\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 133\nA And I would say even before then, because\nthis is Robyn emailing it at 10:38, but they had\nalready had a conversation, so I would say it was\neven earlier than 10:38.\nQ So we don't know how early or how much\nearlier that -\nA Correct.\nQ -- that might have happened?\nA Correct.\nQ But at the latest 10:38, right?\nA Correct.\nQ Now, you have come to learn that between\nwhen the derailment happened, the evening of\nFebruary 3rd, to this point in time, 10:38 a.m.\nFebruary 4th, the PRDs for the vinyl chloride\nmonomer cars had been activating, right?\nA They had been -- yes, they had been\ncycling and activating, opening and then\nresealing, closing, and cycling on like a\ntwo-minute or, you know, often period.\nQ And understanding you may not know the\nspecifics of how often they were cycling, is it\nfair to say you understand that they were\ncontinuously cycling over that period?\nA Yes, it was like an eight or nine-hour\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 134\nperiod, because they reported that on the call\nthat Saturday evening.\nQ So if we look at this email, there's a\nconcern polymerization may occur, but there's no\nindication that they believed polymerization had\nalready occurred, right?\nA It may occur at this time, of this email.\nQ At it may -- it may occur after the point\nin time of this email, right?\nA Based on the way that Robyn summarized the\ndiscussion with Drew McCarty.\nQ Understood.\nSo fair to say that you interpret this\nemail as Drew McCarty, SPSI, and potentially\nothers, believing polymerization might happen in\nthe future even though the PRDs had already been\ncontinuously cycling since the train's -- since\nthe train derailed the night of February 3rd?\nA And I don't put as much credibility in\nthis email as much as the Saturday evening call\nwhere he kind of recapped the day's events and\nwhat his observations were, but they aligned with\nwhat is in this email.\nQ Understood.\nAnd what I'm -- what I'm getting at,\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 135\nMs. Stegmann, is at some point when -- later on\nSaturday when you have the conference call with\nDrew McCarty and others, that's when you-all at\nOxy are first told, we're concerned polymerization\nis occurring in the cars, right?\nA Correct.\nQ And the data point cited to you-all at Oxy\nas to why polymerization is occurring, is the\nactivation of the PRD devices, right?\nA It was specifically the energetic release\nof the -- the one car, I believe it was the third\ncar in the derailment, I don't recall the number,\nbut it was the third one, and it released for 60\nto 70 minutes. And they felt like that energetic\nrelease was an indication of a reaction occurring\nand polymerization, and it's -- it's that -- that\nwas at one point discussed as a concern.\nQ But PRDs activating is not a sign of\npolymerization, right?\nA No. That's how they normally operate.\nQ In fact, the PRDs activating helps to\nreduce the pressure within the cars, right?\nA Correct. It's part of the thermal\nprotection system of a railcar.\nQ And the PRDs activating have a downstream\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 136\neffect on managing the temperature within the cars\nas well, right?\nA The vinyl -- vinyl flashing actually\nprovides a cooling effect within the railcar.\nQ So fair to say as you sit here today, you\ndon't believe that the PRDs activating, even\nenergetically later in the day, were any\nindication of polymerization occurring in those\ncars?\nA No, I actually believe it was all normal\ncourse of action for the PRD and the way -- the\nway you would have expected the relief valves to\nbe reacting -- performing.\nQ I'm going to mark for you now as Exhibit\nthis document. Once you've had a chance to\nlook at that, I will ask you some questions.\nExhibit 11 marked.)\nMR. GOMEZ: And I apologize, Counsel, that\nI didn't upload the prior document, but I think\nyou-all should have it.\nA Yes, I'm familiar. I have read the\ndocument.\nQ You have read that document, which is\nactually -- let's see, it is Group D, Exhibit 31\nto the NTSB investigative hearings, right?\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 137\nA Yes. It was part of that exhibit.\nQ Okay. And the title from the NTSB\ninvestigation is Oxy Vinyls' letter to NTSB\nreferencing SDS sourced documents April 11th,\nIt's the first on the cover page; is that\ncorrect?\nA Yes.\nQ And the actual substantive document\nappears to be an April 11th, 2023 letter that you\nauthored, right?\nA I did not author. It was written, and I\nreviewed and signed as the party representative.\nQ Fair enough. It was submitted by you?\nA By me as the party representative to the\ninvestigation.\nQ Okay. And am I correct that the purpose\nof this letter that was submitted by you was to\nprovide the NTSB with information regarding the\nsafety data sheet for vinyl chloride monomer?\nA Yes. They had a request -- this was one\nof their many requests for information, and I\nbelieve it was -- they wanted the source documents\nthat our SDSs were based off of.\nQ And did you understand at the time that\nyou submitted this letter to the NTSB that one of\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 138\nthe reasons why this information was being\nrequested of you was questions about what the SDS\nsays regarding polymerization?\nA Yes. We realized it was being challenged.\nQ And SDS is an OSHA requirement, isn't it?\nA It is a OSHA hazardous communications\nrequirement, yes.\nQ And the intention of that document is to\nprotect anyone downstream of the product\nmanufacturer who may come in contact with the\nchemical, right?\nA Can you repeat that?\nQ Sure. The purpose of that document is to\nprovide information to anyone downstream of the\nmanufacturer about the propensities or the\nproperties of the chemical, right?\nA I think it's broader than that. It is",
  "anybody working in our facility.\nQ Okay.\nA And even us as a user -- you know, general\nuser within our organization. So it is a broad\ncommunication document for industrial uses, even\nwithin our own facility or by our contractor.\nQ And that is really my question. Would you\nagree with me that it's a document of general\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 139\napplicability?\nA Broad audience and a wide range of\napplicability.\nQ And that is why it's a standardized\ndocument, right?\nA Correct.\nQ So that it provides certain standard\ninformation, regardless of what chemical?\nA In a consistent format, regardless of the\nchemical so that you -- you're looking at a\nsimilar format, similar content across a wide\nrange of chemicals.\nQ And that helps it be used as a quick\nreference in an immediate response action, right?\nA Correct, or a familiar reference.\nQ In your experience with supply chain, can\nyou just describe for me what some of the\ndifferent settings and users that might come into\ncontact with VCM might be?\nMS. BROZ: Objection, form.\nA Can you -\nQ Sure. Let me rephrase that. Let me\nrephrase that.\nFair to say that in your role as supply\nchain, you are overseeing or involved with the\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 140\ntransportation of VCM to a variety of different\nend users?\nA Correct, to customers really, customers.\nQ And customers that might be in different\nsettings. For example, some might in laboratory,\nsome might be warehouses, some might be in an\nindustrial processing facility?\nA General processing facilities because of\nthe quantity of a railcar, but, again, they might\nhave different applications.\nQ And other people might be -- might come\ninto contact with at least the -- the vessel that\nis shipping the vinyl chloride monomer along the\nway, right?\nA Correct.\nQ There could be rail workers, right?\nA Yes.\nQ Yes, there could be sailors, right?\nA I don't know, in general -\nQ It could be anybody?\nA Right.\nQ The idea behind the SDS is that it is\nsupposed to provide information independent of the\nspecific setting in which someone may interact\nwith vinyl chloride monomer, right?\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 141\nA Again, it's a broad communication document\nused to communicate potential hazards in a wide\nrange of settings.\nQ It's not supposed to be the last word on\nhow to handle a specific emergency response\nsituation, right?\nA It is a source document and a tool.\nQ Just one tool in the toolbox?\nA Correct.\nQ What are some of the other tools in the\ntoolbox?\nA Well, if you look in this case, we\nprovided technical assistance via communications,\nphone, meetings. We also, as a -- from our\nproduct ownership, we sent folks to East Palestine\nto be on the ground, you know, again, having that\nface-to-face interaction.\nSo there is different tools that can be\nutilized, and this is just one tool and one\nmechanism to communicate.\nThere is also the Rail Ask app, I think\nthat is what it is called, but they're the -\nthe -- the railroad industry has been trying to\nuse apps to communicate SDSs or emergency guidance\ndocuments on cell phone or electronically\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 142\navailable.\nQ And because the SDS is just one tool in\nthe toolbox, if there's inconsistencies or\nquestions about what the SDS means, Oxy is the\nbest resource to provide guidance on that, right?\nMR. KNIGHT: Objection, foundation.\nA Correct. Oxy is a key resource especially\nas the product donor in this situation.\nQ Let's put that one aside, and we'll mark\nas Exhibit 12 -\nMR. KNIGHT: For the record, did y'all get\nmy objection?\nCOURT REPORTER: Yes.\nExhibit 12 marked.)\nQ Ms. Stegmann, same instruction, just take\na look at that and let me know when I can ask you\nsome questions about it.\nA (Reviewing document.) Yes.\nQ This document that we've marked as\nExhibit 12 to your deposition, it appears to be a\ncalendar invite sent via email by Paul Stancil of\nthe NTSB, right?\nA Correct.\nQ And you are listed as one of the\nrecipients of this email, right?\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 143\nA Correct. I'm one of the party\nrepresentatives.\nQ There were also some other party\nrepresentatives that were included on the email,\nincluding Robert Wood from Norfolk Southern.\nDo you see that?\nA Yes.\nQ And also, if we look at the recipients,\nChief Drabick from East Palestine was a recipient,\ncorrect?\nA Correct.\nQ If we look at the body of the invite, it\nsays: New, please see the attached analysis\nreport which we will be discussing at this\nmeeting. This report and associated photographs\nhave been added to the Kiteworks file share drive.\nDo you see that?\nA I see that.\nQ And then if we skip to the last sentence\nit says: We will be meeting with Oxy Vinyls to\nreview their analysis of post accident tank\nresidue samples collected on February 16-17, 2023,\nthe Oxy Vinyls report to be provided in advance of\nthe meeting.\nDo you see that?\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 144\nA I do.\nQ So was this a calendar invite to certain\nparty representatives in order to discuss the\nresidue sampling that counsel had asked you about\nearlier today?\nA I'm just making sure of my timeline. Yes,\nI believe that was -- that was our very first\nmeeting after joining the NTSB investigation. If\nyou remember, we joined on March 17th, and even\nthough we joined, this was the very first meeting\nthat we were participating as a party\nrepresentative.\nQ I'm going to ask you some questions about\nthis meeting, but before I do, I understand that\nyou are a party representative, and that -- that\nmeans there are certain things you can and cannot\ndiscuss.\nIf for any reason you have a question\nabout what you can or cannot discuss, just let me\nknow. We will go off the record like we did\nbefore. I'm happy to give you the opportunity to\ndiscuss that with counsel. Okay?\nA Correct, thank you.\nQ So this meeting, tell me, do you recall\nanyone from Norfolk Southern participating in that\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 145\nmeeting?\nA No, I do not.\nQ Would you have?\nA I'm trying to -- in my mind, I'm trying to\nmake sure I have the right -- can you tell me what\nday the 20th is?\nQ Do you mean day of the week?\nA Yes.\nMR. GOMEZ: Can we go off record?\nMS. BROZ: Yes.\nVIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the\nrecord. The time is 2:02 p.m.\nRecess 2:02 p.m. to 2:03 p.m.)\nVIDEOGRAPHER: We are going back on the\nrecord. The time is 2:03 p.m.\nMR. GOMEZ: Would you mind just reading\nback the question for us.\nRecord read.)\nA Right. So this was the very first day,\nand I was just finding out I was going to be the\nparty represent- -- I was committed to that on\nFriday, and this was a very early meeting, so I\njumped in not knowing a lot of the names and the\nplayers and who was speaking in that kind of\nforum.\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 146\nQ Okay. So you may not recall specifically\nwho was involved?\nA Correct.\nQ I will just give you names. Do you\nrecall, if at all, whether Robert Wood from\nNorfolk Southern was on the -- was on the call?\nA I just don't recall.\nQ Fair enough. How about Chief Drabick from\nEast Palestine?\nA If it is the meeting I believe, I do\nbelieve he was on the call, because if it's the\ncorrect meeting, he made a strong statement at the\nend.\nQ Okay. What was that statement?\nA It was basically in reference to if\npolymerization didn't occur, his question or",
  "statement was in, if this were to happen again, he\nwanted to know if they should do a vent-and-burn.\nAnd he basically said it would have been nice to\nknow when they -- we were talking about\npolymerization.\nQ So this may have been the meeting where he\nmade that statement -\nA Statement at the very end, yes. He asked\na clarifying question and just said it would have\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 147\nbeen nice to know.\nQ What, if anything, do you recall about the\ndiscussions that took place during this meeting?\nA I just remember John Tummons presenting\nthe analytical approach, I think, the technology,\nthe methods, and talking about the collection\nsample.\nSo I just know it was our technical team\nand they were communicating, and the reason I\nremember the meeting is I held over after the\nmeeting to talk to the NTSB folks, Mr. Stancil and\nMr. Dougherty, for the first time. And that was\ngoing to be my orientation to being a party\nrepresentative based on being -- joining their\nwork stream.\nQ Do you recall if during this meeting any\nof the other parties to the NTSB investigation\nthat may have participated in the call expressed\nconcerns or criticisms about the testing that Oxy\ndid?\nA No, I don't recall. I just remember\nChief Drabick at the end making a -- a comment.\nQ You also mentioned earlier that there were\nsome comments made in the aftermath of derailment\nand the vent-and-burn by public officials.\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 148\nDo you recall talking about that?\nA Yes.\nQ I think you said that there was some\ncomments made by the FRA and the NTSB, right?\nA At the February -- are we talking about -\nQ No, I'm sorry, in the immediate aftermath.\nI think you mentioned, at least with respect to\nthe FRA, there was a video of -\nA February 23rd.\nQ I'm sorry. Can you just -- can you just\ndescribe that for me again?\nA I just remember there being a video\nFebruary 23rd, and I remember Karl Alexy\nwalking -- I think it's when he -- DOT Peter\nButtigieg visited the site, if I remember the\nvideo correctly, and they were touring the\nderailment site. And I remember Karl Alexy being\nthere, Randy Keltz.\nAnd listening to the video, you can see\nthem pointing and he said something about\npolymerization, and I found that odd because he's\nan FRA hazmat technical railcar investigator\nmanager.\nQ And there was also a comment you alluded\nto earlier from Chair Homendy, I believe, right?\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 149\nA She did a press conference. That may have\nbeen the same day or a different day where she\ngave one of her press updates, and it was her and\nthen Robert Hall came up to the podium.\nQ And both of these comments that you just\nidentified, those were made after Oxy had multiple\ntimes between February 4th and February 6th\nadvised Norfolk Southern and its contractors that\npolymerization was not occurring, right?\nA Correct.\nQ And fair to say that those comments from\nthe FRA and the NTSB that you just identified were\nsurprising in light of the conclusions Oxy had\nbeen sharing with Norfolk Southern and its\ncontractors in the days leading up to the\nvent-and-burn?\nA They were surprising that they were\ncontinuing to get so much media attention that it\nwas being communicated in the media, and again, we\nfelt like this whole process was supposed to be a\nfact-finding, go determine the facts, versus\npeople just commenting on what they learned or\nthought they learned being part of Unified\nCommand.\nQ Was it your understanding that the\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 150\ninformation Oxy was providing to Norfolk Southern\nand its contractors specifically about\npolymerization between the 4th and the 6th of\nFebruary was being shared with Unified Command?\nA Yes. I mean, that it was our\nunderstanding. I believe Steve Smith spoke to\nPaul Williams of the NS and got direction on how\nthey wanted us communicating to NS or the\ncontractors, and so obviously if those\ncommunications were occurring, it would be our\nexpectation that those -- that information be\nsupplied through the Unified Command System.\nQ And as you sit here today, do you know\nwhether NS and its contractors actually provided\nthat information to Unified Command before the\nvent-and-burn took place?\nA I personally do not know. Obviously, some\nof that dialogue or lack of dialogue came out in\nthe investigative hearings in East Palestine.\nQ And it came out in that comment that\nChief Drabick made during the phone call we just\ndiscussed, right?\nA Correct.\nQ Because if he had heard about the fact\nthat Oxy concluded polymerization wasn't\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 151\noccurring, he wouldn't be surprised during that\ncall?\nA And he also would not have -- I think he\nspoke to that at the hearing. There was some\nhearing references where he talked about what was\nnot shared or he was not informed of.\nMR. GOMEZ: Could we go off the record?\nVIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the\nrecord. The time is 2:09 p.m.\nRecess 2:09 p.m. to 2:19 p.m.)\nVIDEOGRAPHER: We are going back on the\nrecord. The time is 2:19 p.m.\nMR. GOMEZ: Before we start, I'd just make\na statement that I believe I have nine minutes of\nmy own time remaining, but Trinity, in its\ndiscretion, has allotted me some.\nQ So I'm going to try to wrap up my\nquestions with you as quick as I can,\nMs. Stegmann.\nI want to switch gears to a different\ntopic. Are you -- well, let me withdraw that.\nYou testified on -- at one of the panels\nin June during the NTSB hearings, right?\nA Correct, Panel 4.\nQ And one of the topics that was being\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 152\ndiscussed in Panel 4 was the significance of the\npresence of certain aluminum components on the\nVCM-containing railcars.\nDo you recall that?\nA Yes, I do.\nQ And there was also some discussion about\nacetylides; is that correct?\nA Correct.\nQ Am I pronouncing that correctly?\nA Acetylides, yes.\nQ Okay, great.\nDo you know what the significance of\nacetylides in transportation specifically via\npressurized tanker car is?\nA We provided a document to the NTSB\naddressing that. That was one of our first\nrequests. So I need to be -- I think actually\nthat was part of the hearing so it's a public\ndocument.\nI believe the concern was that, could it\npotentially act as a catalyst if the -- if the\naluminum and VCM were to react, could it be\npart -- could it then produce an acetylide that\ncould be a catalyst.\nSo it was a far reach in trying to draw\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 153\nsome, I guess, hypothesis.\nQ And I want to get into some of that with\nyou -\nA Yes.\nQ -- but I guess just as a general matter,\nwhat I'm still struggling to understand, candidly,\nis whether the issue with acetylides, and tell me\nif I'm wrong, is that they in and of themselves\nare hazardous, or in connection with VCM can serve\nas a catalyst for polymerization?\nA I believe it's the later is what was the\ntheory, but again, I think John Tummons and the\nfolks that produced the technical information to\nsupport that letter and position are the correct\nresources.\nQ And acetylides are specifically an issue\nbecause there are certain transportation\nregulations that apply to prevent the formation of\nacetylides, right?\nA You're -- you're going to get past my -- I\nwasn't even familiar with acetylides until it was\nbrought up by the NTSB in asking us about VCM and\naluminum and us having to do the research to\naddress it as a non-concern.\nQ So do you know why the NTSB put you on the\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 154\npanel to talk about acetylides, among other\nthings, if it's outside of kind of your technical\nexpertise?\nA They didn't really go there as much as\nthey wanted a shipper. They wanted Oxy to be on\nthe panel as a shipper representing the overall\ntank car, and I believe I was there to address\nsome of the FRA observations. And then I believe\nGATX was asked to be part of the hearing, and they\ndid not participate in a hearing.\nQ So full disclosure, I'm going to ask you\nsome questions about this topic because you were\non that panel -\nA Yes.\nQ -- but if it's outside of your technical\nexpertise, just let me know.\nA Okay, yes.\nQ The first thing I want to do is I want to\nmark as Exhibit 13 to your deposition certain of\nthe federal regulations that were discussed during\nthe NTSB investigation.\nExhibit 13 marked.)\nQ And while I'm loading this up for\neverybody, Ms. Stegmann, you're free to look at\nthe whole document, but I am not going to ask\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 155\nabout the whole document.\nInstead, I'm going to direct your\nattention specifically to what's noted as page 373\non the bottom, okay.\nOnce you've had a chance to kind of orient\nyourself and look at it, let me know and I'll ask\nyou my questions.\nA Okay. And you said the bottom of 373, so\nyou're probably going to ask me about one of the\ncommodity provisions.\nQ Yes. Specifically I'm going to ask you\nabout B44 at the top actually.\nA Yes.\nQ And, again, I don't want to deprive you of\nthe opportunity to look through this enthralling\ndocument, but that's the only thing I'm going to\nask you about.\nA No, that's fine.\nQ Okay. Just quickly, by reference to the\nfirst page, I'll represent to you, you see on the\ntop there, it says, Authenticated U.S. Government\nInformation GPO?\nA Oh, I'm sorry -\nQ Sorry, yeah, just one quick reference to\nthe first page of the document, top left-hand\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 156\ncorner.\nA Pipeline hazardous materials...\nQ A bit further up, full -\nA Oh -\nQ Yes.\nA -- up here okay. Yes.\nQ Do you see that?\nA Yes.\nQ GPO?\nA Yes.\nQ I'll represent to you that \"GPO\" is\nGovernment Publishing Office.\nA Okay, thank you.\nQ Okay. And I will represent to you further\nthat I printed this out from the Government\nPublishing Office website, and that it's a copy of\nCode of Federal Regulation 172.102, okay?\nA Yes. It does look familiar. I have seen\nit in printout.\nQ Have you had -- before being on that panel\nin the NTSB hearings, did you have any familiarity\nwith this section of the code of federal\nregulations?\nA I just knew of it, and I knew we had to\ncomply with it, but I had not printed it out and\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 157\nlooked through it extensively.\nQ Okay. Well, fair to say that in the\naftermath of the East Palestine derailment, you\nare now familiar with at least Special Provision\nB44, right?\nA I -- I know that B44 -- yes, I have become\naware of it and understand it is referenced.\nQ Okay.\nA I think even on our SDS.\nQ And that is -- that special provision\nappears on page 373 of this document, right?\nA Yes.\nQ And it reads: All parts of valves and\nsafety relief devices in contact with lading must\nbe of a material which will not cause formulation\nof acetylides.\nDid I read that correctly?\nA Correct.\nQ This was one of the special provisions\nthat was discussed at the NTSB hearings -\nA Yes, it was.\nQ -- right? And this was one of the special\nprovisions that the FRA took exception to in\nconnection with some of the VCM cars, right?\nA I don't know that they took exception to\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 158\nthis one.\nQ Okay. I want to talk specifically about\nwhat the FRA said and what -\nA Okay.\nQ -- and what they've put forward, but\nfirst, just so we can get our bearings on B44, B44\nis not specific to VCM, right?\nA Correct. I mean, that's why they\nreference it this way, so then different\ncommodities they can then reference each of these.\nI'm not sure how you do it, but whatever the B44\nrepresents.\nQ Uh-huh.\nA There's a term. I forget what it is, but\ncorrect, these aren't specific, and then each\nchemical in the hazmat table references these.\nQ VCM happens to be one of the chemicals\nthat's subject to B44 -\nA Correct.\nQ -- but it's not the whole chemical?\nA Not specific, correct.\nQ B44 is also not specific to aluminum,\nright?\nA Correct. I do believe there's another\nmetal. I can't -- I can't recall. It may be\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 159\ncopper, but I don't recall that for sure.\nQ In fact, if we just look at what B44 says,\nit is not specific to any particular construction\nmaterial, right?\nA You're getting outside my area of comfort.\nQ Fair enough. Can we agree that B44 simply\nsays that when you are shipping certain types of\nchemicals, you can't do it in a -- in a vessel\nthat is constructed out of materials that are\ngoing to cause acetylides?\nA Correct.\nQ That is just a plain understanding of what\nB44 says, right?\nA Correct.\nQ Okay.\nA You said vessel. It is all parts of\nvalves and safety relief devices.\nQ Oh, I'm sorry. So let me rephrase that.\nA Yes.\nQ Let me rephrase that.\nGenerally, B44 can we agree means that the\nvalves and -\nA Safety relief devices can contact with\nlading, because not all parts of the valves and\nrelief valve are in contact with the lading.\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 160\nQ So generally -\nA Like the hand wheel and the angle valve is\nnot in contact with the lading.\nQ Understood. So generally what we take\naway from it is these -- these -\nA The wetted parts.\nQ -- these features, if they're coming in\ncontact with the lading, they can't be such that\nthey're going to cause the formation of\nacetylides?\nA Correct.\nQ Just the general, kind of big picture\ntakeaway from it?\nA Yes.\nQ Okay. Let's mark as Exhibit 14 a document\nthat was brought up during the NTSB hearings.\nAgain, same instruction, take a look at it, and\nwhile I'm loading it up -\nA I don't have it.\nExhibit 14 marked.)\nA Oh, I'm supposed to be looking at -- yes,\nI've seen this document.\nQ You are familiar with this document,\nMs. Stegmann?\nA Yes.\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 161\nQ Is it okay if I go ahead and ask you some\nquestions about it?\nA Yes.\nQ Okay. What we're looking at here as\nExhibit 14 is actually a document that is labeled\nGroup H, Exhibit 1 to the NTSB hearings, right?\nA Correct.\nQ And the title on the NTSB cover page is\nFRA-VCM Tank Car Approval Sample Summary, right?\nA That is correct. That is how it is\ntitled.\nQ And it looks to be substantively a\ntwo-page document that if I understand correctly\nwas prepared by the FRA, right?\nA Yes.\nQ And you were asked some questions on the\npanel during the NTSB investigations about some of\nthe observations that the FRA makes in this\ndocument, right?\nA Yes. And for some reason, I thought it\nremembered it being titled FRA observations at\nsome point, but anyway...\nQ To your recollection, does this look like\nthe document -\nA Yes.\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 162\nQ -- you were asked about?\nA Yes.\nQ And if I recall correctly, at the time you\nwere asked certain questions about this during the\nNTSB hearings, you had only received a copy of\nthis -- actually Oxy had only received a copy of\nthis maybe a few weeks earlier, right?\nA We received a copy at the same time all\nthe parties to the investigative hearing received\na copy when it was uploaded to the website as a\ndocket to be released to the public, and that was\nabout -- approximately the first week in June,\njust two weeks prior to the investigative hearing.\nQ Okay.\nA I do not believe it was shared with all\nparties to the investigation because not everybody\nwas at the hearing.\nQ Okay. So if I understand you correctly,\nit only went to the folks who were going to\nparticipate in the panels?\nA It was loaded for the investigative\nhearing, and we had different website updates. So\nI'm just saying, I know it was shared with the\nparties to the investigative hearing. I don't\nknow that it was shared with all parties to the\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 163\ninvestigation at that time. I don't know who had\naccess to what.\nQ Okay. So let me just ask the question\ngenerally then.\nDo you know how much time Oxy had with\nthis document, if any, before the investigative\nhearings?\nA Approximately two weeks, and during that\ntime period, we were reviewing many documents,\nincluding 150 pages of documents that NS submitted\nand were uploaded just prior to the hearing, which\nwere the first time we saw those documents,\nmeaning, we did not have time just to focus on\nthis one document. There was many documents\ncoming in, and some that we were seeing for the\nfirst time.\nWhich I probably need -- well, I guess I\nhave to be careful what I say there because I\ndon't know what part of that is public, but I know\nthat that's public, the hearing docket that -\nQ So it is my intention to ask you only\nabout what the document -\nA Yeah.\nQ -- the material that the document talks\nabout, but again, if I cross into anything -\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 164",
  "A I just have to remember.\nQ -- just let me know.\nA Yes.\nQ So looking at this document, and with the\nunderstanding that at least as of the time of the\nNTSB investigative hearings, you-all at Oxy did\nnot have a lot of time to go through this in\ndetail, is it fair to say that the FRA's\nobservations in this document kind of set forth\ntwo alleged types of violations with respect to",
  "the railcars, one being kind of paperwork\nviolations, and then the other being construction\nviolations?\nA I -- no, I don't agree with that",
  "statement. I believe they were making\nobservations, but I would say all of the\nidentified observations are relative to our\nrecordkeeping and administrative approval\nprocesses.\nI take exception to any comment of a\ndeficiency in the construction or design of any of\nthe railcars.\nQ Okay.\nA I believe we looked at the technical\ndetails of the railcars, meaning the relief valves\nPLANET DEPOS 888 433 3767 | WWW PLANETDEPOS COM\nTranscript of Karenanne Stegmann\nConducted on January 5, 2024 165\nall have to have their own separate AAR approvals,\nthe valves have to have their own AAR approvals,\nall of the equipment on the railcars approved, the\ndesign, the certificate of constructions were all\nAAR approved.\nWhat the FRA took exception to is they\ntried to state that some of the component changes\nor upgrades did not have approval at that time to\nput on that railcar.\nBut all of the components put on these\nrailcars had their own separate approvals, meaning\na Midland company had their relief valves\napproved, it had to have a 4-7 form.\nSo I very strongly tried to state there",
  "was no physical construction, design, or\nengineering concerns related to the five DOT 105\ncars, and I do not own the Trinity car or the GATX\ncar, and GATX was not at the hearing to speak to\ntheir car.\nHowever, in our review and comparison of",

  "documentation process, but that is what I was"
