           EXAMINATION
 BY MR. KNIGHT:
   Q Good morning, Mrs. Stegmann.
   A Good morning.
   Q My name is Jonathan Knight, and I'm joined
 by my co-counsel Sarah Maciel. We're attorneys
 representing Norfolk Southern, and we just want to
 ask you some questions about Oxy and the
 derailment in East Palestine, Ohio.
    We've been given four hours to ask
 questions and we may not use all of that time, but
 if there is unused time we may cede some of that
 time to the other attorneys in case they have some
 additional questions.
    Does that make sense?

   A Yes.
   Q Okay. So with that, can you please state
 and spell your name for the record?
   A Yes, my name is Karenanne Stegmann.
 K-a-r-e-n-a-n-n-e, and Stegmann is
 S-t-e-g-m-a-n-n.
   Q Ms. Stegmann, have you heard of the
 company Norfolk Southern before?
   A Yes.
   Q And does Norfolk Southern have a business
 relationship with Oxy Vinyls?
   A Yes.
   Q And what is that relationship?
   A They are a shipper and we -- or, I'm
 sorry, they are a rail carrier, and we are a
 customer of Norfolk Southern.
   Q And do you understand that we want to ask
 you questions relating to the derailment of
 Norfolk, Southern Train 32N in East Palestine,
 Ohio, on February 3rd, 2023?
   A Yes.
   Q And unless I say otherwise, you understand
 when I say "derailment," that I'm referring to
 that derailment of the Norfolk Southern Train 32N?
   A Yes.

   Q Have you ever testified in a lawsuit
 before?
   A Yes.
   Q Could you at a high level give me a
 description of what the subject matter of the
 lawsuit was?
   A It was an employee termination about -- a
 little over 20 years ago.
   Q Thank you. And is this your first time
 being deposed?
   A No.
   Q So as you know, I'm going to be asking you
 a series of questions today, and after I finish my
 question, I will stop and give you an opportunity
 for your -- for your attorney to object and for
 you to answer the question.
    Does that make sense?
   A Yes.
   Q And in response to my questions, will you
 give me a verbal answer, you know, rather than
 just a nod or a gesture so it can be on the
 written record?
   A Yes, I will.
   Q Great. And if at any time you don't hear
 my question or don't understand my question,

   A Yes.
   Q And if at any time you need a break,
 please let me know. This is not a test in
 endurance, happy to stop it, take a -- take a few
 minutes at any time that -- that you would like
 to.
   A Okay, thank you.
   Q And during the deposition today, there may
 be objections from other attorneys in the room.
 You still will need to answer the question. Those
 objections are for a court to -- to take a look at
 and decide about at a later time.
    Does that make sense?
   A I want to be clear. So if there is an
 objection, I still answer the question?
   Q Correct.
    MS. BROZ: Unless I instruct her not to.
    MR. KNIGHT: Yes, exactly.
   Q Unless you're instructed not to answer the
 question, you will agree to answer all of my
 questions, correct?
   A Okay, yes, I understand that process.
   Q Did you do anything to prepare for your
 deposition today?

   A Yes.
   Q And tell me what you did.
   A I met with Stacy and Alycia yesterday at
 our office building and just reviewed some emails.
   Q And where was that office?
   A It's on the Tollway. It's our Dallas
 chemical office where I report to daily.
   Q Understood. And in that meeting did you
 meet with anyone other than the people you've
 named?
   A No.
   Q Did you do anything else to prepare for
 this deposition today?
   A No.
   Q And how long did that meeting with your
 attorneys yesterday last?
   A Approximately five hours including lunch.
   Q Did you look at any documents while you
 were meeting with your lawyers yesterday?
   A Yes.
   Q And about how many documents would you
 say?
   A Approximately 20, from my recollection.

 of documents you looked at?
   A We -- they provided me my transcript from
 the hearing in East Palestine in June of 2023. I
 also reviewed some emails that I received the day
 of the -- or the following day of the derailment,
 and just some email correspondence that I was on.
    So it was generally emails, my transcript,
 and we may have reviewed or just referenced the
 NTSB investigation. And I know that there was a
 letter because I am a party representative on the
 NTSB investigation.
   Q And when you're referring to the
 transcript, you're referring to the transcript of
 the NTSB hearing?
   A Yes, sir.
   Q And that was the NTSB hearing conducted in
 relation to the derailment of Train 32N, correct?
   A Correct.
   Q And you stated that you reviewed some
 emails, correct?
   A Yes.
   Q And those were emails that you received
 the day of or the day after the derailment?
   A I don't remember all the date references,
 so it may have been long -- different than just

   Q Okay. And about how many emails would you
 say that you reviewed?
   A I think I said previously a total of
 approximately 20 documents.
   Q Okay. So less than 20?
    Yes or no? I'm just -- if you could just
 answer?
   A Yes, one less -- again, I estimated 20
 documents in total including the transcript.
   Q Okay. And so you were sworn in by the
 court reporter, and you understand that you are
 under oath today, correct?
   A Yes, I do.
   Q And is there any reason that you can't
 provide your most complete and accurate testimony
 today?
   A No, I can complete my complete and
 accurate testimony. I just want to reiterate that
 I am a party representative in the NTSB hearing,
 and I signed an agreement stating that certain
 facts that are part of the hearing that have not
 been released, I cannot share.
   Q And could you generally describe the types
 of facts that you agreed not to share as part of

 an agreement you signed with the NTSB?
   A Facts that are learned through the
 investigative process.
   Q Understood. So we'll come to the -- the
 discussion about and questions about the NTSB
 hearing process, and I guess we'll cross that
 bridge when we get to it.
    Before we get to that, I want to just ask
 you some -- some questions about your -- about
 your background and your role at Oxy Vinyls.
    So, Ms. Stegmann, by whom are you
 currently employed?
   A I'm currently employed by Occidental
 Chemical Corporation.
   Q And I'm glad that you -- you've stated
 that you're employed by Occidental Chemical
 Corporation, because I've actually heard several
 entities that seem to -- seem to fall under the
 name "Oxy." So I just want to make sure and I
 hope you can help me understand how they relate to
 each other.
    So I've heard of OxyChem and I've heard of
 Occidental Petroleum and I've heard of the entity
 Oxy Vinyls. And I just -- I guess my first
 question is, is the business of Oxy Vinyls

 Petroleum?
    MS. BROZ: Objection, form.
   A I -- I'm not sure I understand what that
 question is.
   Q Okay. What's the relationship between
 OxyChem and Occidental Petroleum?
   A Occidental Petroleum is our parent company
 and Oxy -- Occidental Chemical Corporation is a
 wholly-owned subsidiary, in my understanding, of
 Occidental Petroleum.
   Q And how does OxyChem relate to the entity
 Oxy Vinyls?
    MS. BROZ: Objection, form. Calls for a
 legal conclusion.
   A Can you repeat the question or rephrase
 it?
   Q Does Oxy Vinyls have any relationship to
 the company Oxy Chemicals -- OxyChem?
    MS. BROZ: Objection, form, calls for a
 legal conclusion.
   A We're all affiliated companies.
   Q So is Oxy Vinyls an affiliate of OxyChem?
    MS. BROZ: Same objections.
   A I'm not a corporate structure person. Oxy

 Vinyls -- I'm not sure I can answer your question,
 understanding what -- it sounds like you're trying
 to ask a corporate structure question, and I'm not
 sure that I'm able to answer what you are looking
 for.
   Q Well, do you have responsibility for
 supply chain for Oxy Vinyls?
   A Yes. I have supply chain responsibilities
 for all of Oxy Vinyls and all of Occidental
 Chemical Corporation.
   Q So whatever the relationship is between
 these entities, you are in change of their supply
 chains?
   A Yes.
   Q Okay. And do you have an understanding
 that -- that Berkshire Hathaway is an investor in
 Oxy Vinyls?
    MS. BROZ: Objection, form.
   A You stated Berkshire Hathaway is an
 investor of Oxy Vinyls. I understand them to be
 an investor in Occidental Petroleum Corporation
 because -
   Q Thank you.
   A -- OxyChem and Oxy Vinyls don't have
 stock. We're part of Occidental Petroleum.

 profile that we printed out just so we could ask
 you some questions about some of the terminology
 in your description of your LinkedIn.
    (Exhibit 1 marked.)
    MS. BROZ: Jonathan, there is no URL on
 this printout, if you obtained it from LinkedIn.
    MR. KNIGHT: Well, there is a URL. If you
 look at the upper left, the URL, there is
 LinkedIn.com.
    MS. BROZ: Okay. And then what is the
 date that you printed this out?
    MR. KNIGHT: I'll tell you in just a
 moment. Printed it out on January 3rd, 2024.
    MS. BROZ: Thank you.
   Q Ms. Stegmann, have you updated your
 LinkedIn profile since January 3rd of 2024?
   A No, I have not.
   Q So if you look on the first page under
 Director of Supply Chain, it says the
 responsibilities are for demand chain planning and
 some other things. I wanted to ask, what is
 demand chain planning?
   A Demand chain planning is setting the
 production plans based on our business

 requirements, and we plan for those and set the
 production schedules of our facilities based on
 those business requirements.
   Q And what do you do in relation to demand
 chain planning?
   A When, what time frame? What do you mean,
 what do I do?
   Q I mean, do you have -- do you interface
 with -- with people at the actual facilities that
 are producing Oxy's products?
   A I'm not sure I understand your question.
   Q So are you in charge of actually producing
 Oxy Vinyl's products?
   A I supervise a team, and they're not
 responsible -- they're responsible for taking the
 sales forecast requirements and matching those to
 our production capabilities. So they are
 determining what we need to produce based on
 customer forecasts and sales forecasts.
   Q And what do you do with that information
 of what needs to be produced?
    MS. BROZ: Objection, form.

 the schedule and passes that to the manufacturing
 facilities.
   Q Okay. And the description in LinkedIn
 also says that you're responsible for commercial
 logistics. And what is commercial logistics?
   A Commercial logistics is setting the
 relationship with our transportation providers.

 mentioned in Pedricktown, New Jersey?
   A Yes.
   Q And can you describe your level of
 familiarity with the polymerization process
 currently employed at the Oxy Vinyls Pedricktown
 facility?
   A I was the plant manager of the Pedricktown
 facility for approximately five years. However, I
 have not been onsite since 2004.
   Q Well, at the time that you were the plant
 manager and that you were onsite, can you describe
 the polymerization process that was implemented at
 the Pedricktown facility?
   A Can I describe it, yes, but it's been many
 years.
   Q Well, was the process a batch process?
   A The reaction process in the reactor area
 is a batch process.
   Q And have you heard the term "suspension
 polymerization"?
   A Yes.

 vinyl chloride monomer added to water in the
 polymerization reactor?
   A Can you repeat that question?
   Q In the suspension polymerization process
 at the Pedricktown, New Jersey facility, while you
 were plant manager there, was the reaction
 conducted in a batch reactor involving adding
 vinyl chloride monomer to water?
    MS. BROZ: Objection, form.
   A The batch process includes reacting or
 having water and vinyl chloride monomer added to
 the reactor.
   Q And do you recall the ratio of vinyl
 chloride monomer to water in the process?

 today.
   Q And then I think another facility you
 mentioned that produces PVC for Oxy Vinyls is the
 Deer Park, Texas facility?
   A Yes.

 during the semester, but in the summers.
   Q And what were your summer roles?
   A One summer I worked at the University of
 Delaware in the chemical engineering and biology
 labs, so I was a research assistant. I don't
 remember the exact title. And then the following
 year, I worked at Dupont.
   Q And where was -- was it that you worked at
 Dupont?

 polymerization of VCM to form PVC would have been
 conducted at at any of those facilities?
    MS. BROZ: Objection, form.
   A Yes. I would have understood the
 temperature and the batch process in my early
 years when I was a process engineer in Pasadena.
   Q And you have a current recollection of
 what temperature that was?
   A The -- I mean, temperature is very
 specific for setting your product viscosity of
 PVC, and so that temperature is dependent on what
 product you're making. PVC is a generic product.
 There's grades of PVC, and each grade of PVC may
 have a different reaction temperature.

   Q And generally a higher temperature is
 going to yield a lower molecular weight PVC,
 correct?
   A I believe you have -- you are asking
 questions that are beyond my recollection.
   Q Well, how many grades of PVC does Oxy
 Vinyls make?
   A I don't know that number anymore off the
 top of my head to that level of degree.
   Q Would it have been more than five?
   A I can think of more than five, but I can't
 be more specific than that. I'm not at that level
 of detail today.
   Q And were there any PVC polymerization
 temperatures for the processes conducted by Oxy
 Vinyls in excess of 100 degrees Fahrenheit?
   A Can you repeat that question?
   Q So you testified that Oxy Vinyls
 manufactures multiple grades of PVC, correct?
   A Yes.
   Q And you testified that the temperature
 used to make those different grades could be
 different for different grades, correct?
   A The reaction temperature would be
 different potentially for different grades.

   Q And so my question is, do you recall if
 any of the reaction temperatures were in excess of
 100 degrees Fahrenheit?
   A Yes.
   Q And were any of the reaction temperatures
 in excess of 150 degrees Fahrenheit?
   A Not at the reaction process, no.
   Q So the reaction temperatures were less
 than 150 degrees Fahrenheit?
   A That's my recollection.
   Q Thank you.
    How long does it take to make PVC in Oxy
 Vinyls' batch reactor?
    MS. BROZ: Objection, form.
   A At what time period?
   Q Well, I'm asking how long the
 polymerization reaction takes.
    MS. BROZ: Same objection.
   A I would not know that value today. I've
 been out of the plants for more than 10 years.
   Q And do you have a recollection of how long
 it took when you were involved in plant management
 10 years ago?
   A How long what took?

   A I don't recall that level of detail.
   Q Would it have been more than an hour?
   A Yes, I can say that.
   Q And more than two hours?
   A I can say I know it is greater than four
 hours, but beyond that, I don't want to give a
 number that is incorrect.
   Q Thank you. And do you have a recollection
 10 years ago -- from 10 years ago when you were
 still a PVC plant manager what pressure the
 process was conducted at?
   A No. And I want to be clear, 10 years ago
 I was over five facilities in Houston, so it has
 been quite some time since I've had direct
 responsibility for just the PVC plant at this
 level of detail.
   Q Understood, and I was just trying to get a
 sense if you have personal knowledge of, you know,
 the pressure the polymerization at Oxy Vinyls'
 facilities is conducted at.
    MS. BROZ: Is there a question?
   Q Well, that is my question. Do you have

   A One atmosphere of pressure?
   Q Yes.
   A One psi?

   A I am aware of the derailment. At that
 time I was director of supply chain. I was
 transitioning, so I was moving from Houston to
 Dallas at that time, and actually the day of the
 derailment, I was closing on my house here in

 happened to the railcars carrying Oxy's VCM when

   Q Could you please describe that?
   A I recall that Conrail railroad was moving
 the cars over a bridge in the Paulsboro area, and
 there was a failure mechanism and the train
 derailed, and one of our cars fell from the bridge
 as part of the derailment and was punctured in the
 waterway.
   Q And so the VCM train car was breached; is
 that another way to say it?
   A Correct. The one vinyl car was breached.
   Q And the VCM in that railcar was released;
 is that correct?
   A Yes.
   Q Okay. And do you know where the VCM tank
 cars that derailed in the Paulsboro derailment
 were headed as a final destination?
   A Pedricktown facility, yes.

 from us but I don't know.
   Q Okay. Do you know whether there were any
 changes to the manner in which Oxy Vinyls prepared
 railcars of VCM for shipping in response to the
 Paulsboro derailment?

 meaning there's different requirements to ensure
 that you don't overload a railcar. And what we
 wanted to do was make sure those calculations were
 in place, and we implemented some safeguards
 within our ERP system.
   Q So what does it mean to, when you say,
 "overload a railcar"?
   A If you put more material in it and exceed
 a weight limit, or there's also an outage volume
 vapor space requirement that you need to maintain.
   Q And did you have any indication that those
 requirements were violated in the railcar that
 derailed in the Paulsboro derailment?

   A I don't recall the -- the loading of the
 specific car that derailed in the Paulsboro
 incident, but I know we looked at that process as
 a result of the Paulsboro incident.
   Q And you -- when you looked at that
 process, you found there was room for improvement?
   A Yes. And what we did was implement layers
 of protection to ensure that we could prevent a
 shipment of a car that would have any concerns in
 that area. So we put that in our enterprise

   Q And so what did you add to your process
 that reduced the risk that you would have an

    When you say "the investigation factual
 reports are completed," are you referring to the
 NTSB factual reports?
   A Yes.
   Q And so I'm not asking about what the NTSB
 is doing. I'm asking about what Oxy is doing.
   A Oxy, as a participant in the NTSB
 investigation, had many elements of its loading
 process reviewed. That process is complete, and
 we're not -- I'm not aware of any ongoing
 activities as a result of the derailment. My
 point is that the NTSB investigation drove us. We
 had to as part of the investigative -
 investigation.

 are -- has Oxy made any changes to the manner in
 which it prepares tank cars of vinyl chloride

 Thoroughbred safety award and were recognized in
 October of 2023 at the AAR tank car committee by
 NS, as well as six of the seven Class I railroads.
   Q So given that, what is your basis for your
 statement that you expect safe shipment of vinyl
 chloride monomer by rail carriers?
   A Railroads have the operating
 responsibility for transporting for trains. They
 have the safety procedures and safety systems. We
 have the responsibility for safely securing the
 railcars prior to shipment and we have
 demonstrated based on our safe shipping history.
    We recently won an award from CSX for
 shipping safely on their system for 15 years. I
 recently met with Joe Hendricks, their CEO, to
 recognize that accomplishment in November of this
 year in Florida -- or Georgia.
   Q Given that, you certainly wouldn't allow a
 railcar of VCM to be shipped on a rail if you
 thought there was a good chance of it derailing,
 would you?
   A I'm surprised that a railroad is asking me
 about a big chance of having a derailment.

    You wouldn't allow a railcar of VCM to be
 shipped on a rail if you thought there was a risk
 of derailment, would you?
   A No.
   Q So you think shipment by rail is a safe
 way to transport vinyl chloride monomer, correct?
   A Shipment by rail is a safe way to
 transport all goods including vinyl chloride
 monomer stabilized, and I believe the AAR industry
 has many publications about the safe transport of
 the rail industry and their capabilities,
 abilities, and safeguards for safely transporting
 goods by rail.

 chloride monomer by contracting with Norfolk
 Southern, correct?
   A We safely tran- -- or, yes, we today ship
 stabilized vinyl chloride monomer with the NS.

 chloride monomer with Norfolk Southern through

   A We expect the railroad carriers based on
 regulations of our federal government, the FRA,
 the Department of Transportation, to be able to
 safely transport goods by rail, including -

 you wouldn't ship by rail vinyl chloride monomer,
 correct?
   A The expectation is that we are able to
 ship under the common carrier obligation our
 products safely by the rail carriers, and they
 have an obligation to provide safe transport of
 goods by rail.
   Q And what is the common carrier obligation?
   A Railroads have an obligation to provide
 rail service to customers.
   Q And they don't -- Norfolk Southern doesn't
 have the option of declining to ship vinyl
 chloride monomer for Oxy Vinyls?
   A Oh, yes, they do. They competitively
 sought our business. They competitively sought
 our business. We have shipped by the CSX and the
 NS, and the NS has competitively sought our
 business.
   Q And they won your business, correct?
   A Yes. And we were a safe shipper on their
 rail line and won the award for 2022.
   Q Do you have an understanding of who your
 largest customer for vinyl chloride monomer is
 besides Oxy Vinyls' PVC plants?
   A Yes.

   Q Do you have an understanding of how many

 VCM facility has shipped by rail in the last 12
 months?
   A I don't recall the specific numbers at
 this point.
   Q Would it -- would it have been in the
 thousands?
   A I don't recall the number.
   Q Would it have been more than 100 tank
 cars?
   A I can say it is more than 100, but I
 haven't really sat to look at the numbers. I
 mean, I know we would have that information, but I
 don't know that, and again, I don't want to guess
 under oath.
   Q Do you have an understanding of the dollar
 value of the vinyl chloride monomer in a VCM tank
 car?

   A What do you mean by "dollar value"?

 states that the only sure way to avoid future

 transport of VCM is unsafe and disproportionately
 impacts underserved communities?
   A I can't say how it impacts underserved
 communities. I don't know what communities
 they're referencing, and I don't know what they
 mean by disproportionately impacting those
 underserved communities.

   A Continue with the shipments that are by
 rail today, correct.
   Q And you plan to continue shipping VCM by
 rail through East Palestine, Ohio, correct?
   A We continue to ship VCM on the Norfolk
 Southern. They determine the routing. We also
 ship VCM on the UP. It leaves our facility on the

   A Yes. As a sales and marketing
 representative, she was communicating to her
 customer that we had cars involved, and -- and
 that's customary on quite a significant incident.
   Q And after receiving this email, were you
 involved in any internal discussion at Oxy about
 the derailment between February 4th and February
 6th of 2023?
   A Yes.
   Q And did this discussion include how
 shipments of vinyl chloride monomer would be
 impacted by the derailment from a logistics
 perspective?
    MS. BROZ: Objection, form.
   A Can you ask the question again?
   Q Well, my question is that, did Oxy's
 internal discussions include discussions of how
 railcar shipments of vinyl chloride monomer would
 be impacted by the derailment?
    MS. BROZ: Objection, form.
   A I know there were discussions, but we were
 more focused on the incident in East Palestine,
 the response efforts, and the status of our five
 derailed cars.

   Q Sure.
    So you -- you testified that you were

 the derailment, and my question is whether some of
 those discussions included a discussion about what
 advice to provide people who were on the scene in
 East Palestine?
   A Initially those -
    MS. BROZ: Objection, form.
   A Initially those discussions were more
 centered around about us getting an update and
 understanding of the situation in East Palestine.
 It was based on some of the content shared from NS
 and its contractors that then we began providing
 some technical insights on the VCM properties.
   Q So I've heard discussions about Oxy
 Vinyls' special situations team in Dallas. My
 question is, were you a member of the Oxy Vinyls
 special situations team in response to this
 derailment?
   A Not formally, and initially, at some point

 at the end of Saturday night, I was in that room
 for a brief period of time because I went to work
 to pick up -- I was traveling the following
 workday, so I went into the office to pick up some
 papers that I needed for my travel, and they were
 still meeting, and I just stopped, by but through
 all of Saturday, I was participating remotely like
 my peers. I was not a designated member of the
 SSP.
   Q So you were not a designated member of the
 SSP, but you participated in some of the
 discussions?
   A What I mean "designated members," there's
 folks that report to the office and they're
 collecting the information, but as an executive of
 OxyChem, I was calling in as a participant and
 helping.
   Q When was the first, if you can recall,
 discussion that you participated in?
   A On the incident or as part of the SSP?
   Q In the incident.
   A I vividly remember because when I received
 Meghan's email, I was at a gym parking lot ready
 for a fitness class, and I went to check in and

 the email. So I immediately read it, knew that
 the likelihood it was a significant incident, and
 I called Mr. Paul Thomas, our vice president of
 health, environmental, safety, security.
    I told him I hadn't looked at my emails to
 see where CHEMTREC was in reporting this, but that
 we were involved -- we had cars involved in a
 derailment involving vinyl chloride monomer in
 Ohio, and that I was headed back home and I would
 notify our president and send something out to our
 executive team.
    And so I proceeded home and called our
 president, and then I put out an email to the
 executive team informing them of the
 East Palestine derailment of the Norfolk Southern
 32N train, and that we had five cars involved in
 the derailment.
   Q When was the first -- strike that.
    After you sent out that communication, did
 you participate in any meetings on Saturday in
 connection with the derailment?
   A Yes. There was a Saturday evening
 conference call and -- on Teams was the media
 format, and that was a formal call.

 but the actual meeting occurred the early evening,
 or the evening of Saturday, February 4th.
   Q And after that meeting, did you
 participate in any other meetings in connection
 with the derailment on Sunday, February 5th?
   A Yes. There was a morning meeting Sunday,
 February 5th, and then there was an evening
 meeting on the evening of February 5th, and I
 believe there was one Monday morning, February 6th
 that I participated in.
   Q During any of these meetings, do you
 recall whether you heard any information that
 responders in East Palestine were concerned about
 the risk of polymerization?
   A Yes. That was expressed by the NS
 contractor Drew McCarty Saturday evening, February
 4th, was the first we heard of that, or that I
 heard of it.
   Q During the Monday morning meeting on
 February 5th -

 you learn of any other concerns that the on-scene
 responders had about the risk of polymerization?
    MS. BROZ: Objection, form.
   A Can you repeat the question?
   Q Well, after the Saturday evening call, you
 participated in three other meetings through
 Monday morning of February 6th, correct?
   A Yes, three large internal meetings, yes,
 or actually NS was on one of them and its
 contractors, I think, Sunday morning.
   Q So NS or its contractors were present on
 the Saturday evening meeting and on the Monday
 morning meeting?
   A Sunday morning.
   Q Sunday morning meeting, okay. And they
 were not present on the Sunday evening meeting or
 the Monday morning meeting; is that correct?
   A Not the meetings I was on, correct.
   Q Okay. And so my question is, on the
 Sunday evening meeting on February 5th, do you
 recall hearing about any concern that the Norfolk
 Southern or its contractors had about
 polymerization?
   A That is the Sunday evening meeting.

   Q Yes.
   A I believe, if I remember the timeline
 correctly, Steve Smith, our La Porte technical
 manager, was on scene, and he was -- I believe
 that is when he was providing an update, so we
 knew that they -- there was a discussion, but NS
 and its contractors themselves expressed those
 concerns in the prior two meetings.
   Q And did Steve Smith or anyone else relay
 additional concerns on the Sunday evening meeting?
    MS. BROZ: Objection, form.
   A I don't remember the content of what he
 expressed. I know he was describing his arrival,
 who he was meeting with, and discussions, and I
 know he was getting an update from Drew McCarty
 and met with members of the NTSB when he first
 arrived. So I believe that they were voicing
 their observations and concerns.
    I think Steve was spending time that
 Sunday evening trying to get -- communicate what
 his view of the scene was and situation.
   Q Same question for the Monday morning
 meeting.

 is when we started hearing about the temperature
 rise and the governor was -- you know, the whole
 process.
    I -- I remember specifically on that call
 he describing what the explosive vent-and-burn
 process was going to entail because that was very
 unusual for us, not something us as Oxy were any
 what -- familiar with.
    And what I vividly remember listening
 intently to, hearing how they were going to
 prepare the site, put the two explosives on each
 railcar, and direct the flow out of the railcar as
 it was burning, each of the railcars.
    There were other discussion points, but I
 probably most vividly remember that discussion.
   Q So in the four meetings that we've
 discussed, the Saturday evening call, the Sunday
 morning call, the Sunday evening call on February
 5th, or the Monday morning call on February 6th,
 do you recall any discussion of Oxy Vinyls' safety
 data sheet?
   A I don't remember that specifically. I
 think there were larger topics Drew may have
 brought up as a reference or somebody may have
 brought up as a reference, but I don't remember

 that specifically. I guess there is other
 elements of the conversation I recall.
   Q Same question, but instead of the safety
 issue, was there any discussion of the emergency
 response guide?
   A I do remember that on the Saturday evening
 call. There may have been follow-up on Sunday
 morning, but I -- I remember the emergency
 response guide being a term used discussing
 Saturday evening.
   Q And you recall what was discussed in
 relation to the emergency response guide?
   A Yes. Drew McCarty explained to us that
 they were concerned about a potential BLEVE as a
 result of polymerization in the railcar, and
 that -- that is why they had the hot zone,
 evacuation zone of a mile radius, and I just
 remember myself and I would say the tone of our
 leadership team were stunned at the information
 being presented to us.
    And so the questions evolved around, how
 do you know a mile is enough. If you really think
 there is a BLEVE -- and again, this was a shock to
 us, those of us hearing it for the first time.
 And so the question really was centered around

 making sure there is modeling, and if you really
 think that is going to occur, how confident are we
 in a mile radius.
    And then subsequently in that discussion,
 and it may have been on the call or a subsequent
 discussion afterwards is when I heard the
 emergency response guide referenced, and that is
 why there is a mile evacuation zone.
   Q And what was it that was shocking? Was it
 the mile or some other aspect of what was being
 communicated to you?
   A Polymerization, and that there was a
 potential for a BLEVE of these railcars.
   Q So you were really surprised by the
 discussion of the potential for a BLEVE?
   A Yes. When we got on the call, that is not
 what we were ex- -- I mean, yes.
   Q What were you expecting?
   A An update hearing that the status of the
 pressure relief devices venting. You know, we
 heard discussions that the protective housing -
 you could see the flame, called it a lazy flame,
 you know, where it is just flaming when there is
 release of materials of PRDs.
    I'm not aware of Oxy having any railcars

 or tanks involved in a BLEVE, so it is the first
 time we were, in my recollection, dealing with
 this potential of an incident. And I hadn't heard
 of a BLEVE in any other vinyl chloride monomer
 tank car situation in my 34-year career.
   Q So if you go back to Exhibit 7, if you go
 back to the first page -
   A On Exhibit 7?
   Q Yes.
   A Okay.
   Q That is right. So in the middle of this

    Can you tell me who is Leigh Glass?
   A Yes. Leigh Glass is our rail operations

 a group of the operations -- truck operations and
 rail operations group as well as regulatory
 manager.
   Q So Leigh Glass was writing Meghan Achimasi
 and he writes: Meghan, can you advise if NS plans
 to re-route traffic headed to Pedricktown? It
 says: We're already tight on inventory and we're
 trying to evaluate production impact.
    So my question is, were you aware that -
 strike that.
    Did you have an understanding that Oxy was
 already tight on inventory and trying to evaluate
 a production impact?
   A I was aware that the inventory shipments
 were tight, that we were lean on shipments. Was I
 aware of this email at this time? No. But it
 was -- I think it may have been forwarded to me,
 maybe not, I don't know.
   Q And then Meghan Achimasi responds: Hi,
 Leigh, I'm looking into this and should have an
 answer for you soon. Our first priority has been
 safety, allowing the fire to go out and then
 cleaning up the derailment when it's safe to do
 so.

    Do you recall receiving that particular
 part of the email chain at some point?
   A I may have, or it may have been forwarded
 to me as part of the investigation preparation.
   Q I apologize, let's look at Exhibit 7 just
 for one more minute. It says, the last sentence,
 Meghan Achimasi's email she sends says: I would
 say trucking some material in, if that's at all
 possible, is the right thing to do because there
 are likely to be delays.
    My question is, did -- do you know if Oxy
 Vinyls has ever trucked any vinyl chloride monomer
 in response to the East Palestine derailment?
   A No, we did not.
   Q I want to show you what has been marked as
 Exhibit 8.
    (Exhibit 8 marked.)
   Q So this is an email -- this is an email
 from Leigh Glass forwarded over to some other
 folks at Oxy. The subject of it is CERP Level III
 reported.
    And I just have some terminology questions
 I was hoping you could help me with. In this

 10:44 a.m. It says: A CERP Level III incident
 has been reported for the following HSE off-site
 transport sub-incident within Intelex.
    And my first question is, what is Intelex?
   A It's our -- it's like a database software
 system. So we use it for collecting, documenting
 incidents and follow-up to incidents. It's an
 HESS software system that we utilize.
   Q And the email also refers to CERP, and can
 you explain what CERP refers to?
   A I'm trying to remember what the incident
 is -- we call all of our transportation incidents
 CERP incidents and whether it's -- whatever mode.
   Q It just means there was an incident?
   A Yes, it's -- and not even -- an incident
 and it can be very minor or obviously -- and
 that's what the Level III is.
   Q That was my next question, what does Level
 III mean?
   A It's the highest level of the incidents.
 So lower level incidents, I wouldn't be copied on.
 It might just be a minor issue, a sideswipe of two
 railcars, no product release.
   Q With respect to a Level III incident, did
 you have particular responsibilities on February

   A I think you said -- I'm sorry, can you say
 that again? You referenced a date and
 responsibilities. Can you rephrase that?
   Q Sure. So I'm asking about the time of the
 derailment on February 3rd, 2023, and at that
 time, did you have particular responsibilities at
 Oxy Vinyls, should a Level III incident occur?
   A My responsibility's to make sure that the
 supply team is responding to whatever the CERP
 incident is, and at this point, if you recall in
 an earlier exhibit, I had already received an
 email from Meghan Achimasi. So I was aware of it
 and had already taken action in notifying others,
 which is really just a parallel communication to
 this process that we have, automated process.
   Q Okay. And I wanted to get your
 understanding of the various parts of Oxy's
 response to the derailment. One aspect, if I
 understand, was to form a special response team in
 Dallas.
    And you described the existence and said
 you weren't a formal part of it, but participated
 in some of the discussions; is that fair?

   A I think I'm a formal part, in that I'm
 going to be updated from the SSP. When I say "not
 formal," I didn't respond to the corporate office.
 My old position and my direct report, Christi
 Young, did to represent supply chain.
    My formal obligation was then to be
 calling in and checking in and asking questions of
 the supply chain to assist in making sure we had
 resources available.
   Q And I've also heard there was a strike
 team in Houston. Did such a thing exist?
   A We -- we referenced an emergency response
 team as a strike team in the past. I don't know
 that it exists today, but again, we -- we did
 dispatch representatives, so I -- I think the
 strike team may be there's an emergency response
 team in Houston.
   Q And are they the ones -- is there a
 connection between those folks and the people that
 were sent from Oxy Vinyls to East Palestine, Ohio?

 response team.

   A Yes.
   Q And between February 4th and February 6th,
 did you yourself have any -- participate in any

   A I'm assuming the date and time are
 correct, yes.
   Q Okay. So it looks like Drew McCarty of
 SPSI had been communicating with Robyn Kinsley, is
 what I would take from this email. And the
 question I have is, is the Chlorine Institute a
 good resource for information about vinyl chloride
 monomer?
    MR. GOMEZ: Objection.
    MS. BROZ: You can go ahead and answer.
    MR. GOMEZ: You can answer.
   A Okay. I don't know that I'm supposed to
 judge the Chlorine Institute, but they are a
 technical organization and they had a -- helped
 develop a pamphlet since a wide use of chlorine is
 used in vinyl chloride. So we use them as a -
 the membership uses them as a technical
 organization.

 Institute?
   A Oxy is.

   A Not a strong role. I have reached out and
 talked to Robyn Kinsley in the past and so I will
 interact on transportation-related questions or
 advocacy or concerns.
   Q In the -- and do you recall whether
 yourself or anyone else ever reached out to -
 strike that.
    The bottom of the email, the last sentence
 from Robyn Kinsley states that: Drew said feel
 free to give him a call to find out more details.
    And my question is, do you know whether
 someone from Oxy reached out to find out more
 details?
   A I'm surprised this Drew went to -- from
 SPSI went directly to Robyn. That may be a great
 resource, but I know that he knows Oxy folks such
 as Tim Kelly. And I know that Tim Kelly and Drew
 McCarty were in communication as of Saturday
 evening and before, because I heard from Tim Kelly
 and others that they were in communications with
 Drew McCarty.
    So I can't say who reached out to who, but
 I know that I was aware of the company SPSI. I
 don't know a lot about them, but I've heard the

 name before and I know that they were in
 communication Saturday.
   Q It looks like they were -- looks like Drew
 McCarty was in communication with the Chlorine
 Institute on Saturday morning, correct?
   A That is what this appears.
   Q Within a few hours plus or minus of when
 you first received a notification that there had
 been a derailment?
   A Right. So at 8:40 was our first
 notification, and I don't know what our Eastern
 Standard or times or -- I know there's been
 various time zones used in some emails but -- but
 I think to be clear, Drew McCarty was, my
 understanding, an NS contractor in this role.
   Q So I wanted to kind of move past the
 vent-and-burn event in East Palestine and just ask
 you some questions about what happened after the
 vent-and-burn.
    So can you describe your responsibilities
 in relation to the derailment following the
 vent-and-burn on February 6th?

   Q Sure. You had a responsibility at some
 point as a party representative to the NTSB,
 correct?
   A We didn't join the NTSB investigation
 until March 17th.
   Q Okay. And you had -- did you have
 responsibility in connection with -- with
 government affairs at Oxy Vinyls?
    MS. BROZ: Objection, form.
   A I wasn't working on any of the advocacy
 initiatives for a period of time. I know I wasn't

   A I was copied on some emails and if -
 maybe asked to review a document, but that wasn't

 affairs rolled under Paul Thomas at the time.

 the NTSB hazardous materials group and the role

 I apologize for interrupting you. I just can't
 hear you.
   Q I'll speak up.
    MS. BROZ: Thank you.
    MR. KNIGHT: Certainly, and I apologize
 for that.
   Q Other than your NTSB role and the limited
 media role that you described, did you have any
 other role in relation to the derailment after
 February 6th?
    MS. BROZ: Objection, form, misstates
 testimony.

   Q Well, I really can't, because I'm trying
 to discover what your various roles were, and I
 don't know what all they may have been.
   A Related to?
   Q The derailment.
   A Initially our response was ensuring that
 we were responsive to my organization, or my team
 was responsive to the FRA request, the NTSB
 request, PHMSA request, and providing any
 technical information that was requested from the
 various organizations.

    So that was a major effort to make sure
 that we had the teams and the folks aligned, so
 that was really a focus. Obviously I had other
 responsibilities outside the derailment.
    Then as -- at some point late probably in
 March -- early March, maybe late February, as
 there were media updates regarding this incident,
 it became clear to Oxy that we needed to consider
 being part of the NTSB investigation to correct
 the narrative that was being played out in the
 media. That misinformation was being
 communicated, or information that was not clear to
 us as being technically correct.
    And so I was asked to evaluate or
 understand, learn more about the NTSB organization
 because we had not been a party to their
 investigation. We weren't very familiar with the
 organization.
    And so I eventually reached out or got
 connected with Sarah Puro at the NTSB, and there
 was an effort in figuring out and then
 recommending a meeting and joining the NTSB
 investigation.
   Q So you mentioned one entity. I just
 wanted to make sure I understood. You said FNSA?

   A PHMSA.
   Q What is that?
   A It is the Pipeline Hazardous Materials
 Safety Association, so they're in the Department
 of Transportation. So Bill Schoonover is the
 associate director, I believe.
   Q And you stated that there was
 misinformation in the media that caused Occidental
 to become interested in becoming part of the NTSB
 process; is that fair?
   A There was -- yes, yes.
   Q Okay. And could you just tell me a little
 bit about what that misinformation was?
   A I specifically remember the video that
 circulated on February 23rd, I believe that is the
 correct date. I remember seeing Karl Alexy, Randy
 Keltz of the FRA touring the East Palestine
 derailment scene and Randy speaking about, well,
 there was polymerization occurring. He's a
 federal government employee with the FRA speaking
 about polymerization.
    If you look, Chair Homendy and Robert Hall
 did a press conference, I believe it was that same
 time period, and I remember Robert Hall stepping
 up to the podium, talking about polymerization.

    So we had very high-level government folks
 making statements that we then realized that we
 had to assess the technical ability to.
   Q So in your -- what you view as information
 about polymerization, did you have a view that
 that was detrimental to Oxy Vinyls?
    MS. BROZ: Objection, form.
   A I think we wanted facts, and I expect the
 media and if our government agencies are
 conducting media statements that facts are
 presented, and there were statements there that we
 didn't understand.
   Q So my question was, would that information
 be detrimental to Oxy Vinyls?
    MS. BROZ: Objection, form, asked and
 answered.
   A Again, I think our -- our concern was that
 facts be presented in this investigation as we
 understood the mission of the NTSB to be. And
 there were a lot of -- I mean, you demonstrated
 some exhibits to me, a lot of media outlets. And
 so at this point we recognized that Oxy should be
 a part of the NTSB investigation.
    If you look, no other shipper was, no
 other customer of the NS, and there were many

 customers impacted by the NS derailment. There
 were many shippers that had cars breached that
 leaked chemicals into the environment, and they
 were not part of the investigative hearing.
    It has been a considerable resource
 requirement of Oxy in considering my time. So we
 didn't enter lightly, but it was obvious that it
 was a necessity for us to join to make sure facts
 are presented as facts regarding VCM chemical
 properties.
   Q So it was -
   A And the safe transportation of vinyl
 chloride monomer.
   Q So it was important to Oxy Vinyls to get
 the facts about vinyl chloride monomer correct in
 the NTSB process; is that correct?
   A I think as we joined the investigation, it
 has been important to make sure there are facts
 presented accurately.
   Q And why is that important to Oxy?
   A Because we're a compliant, authentic,
 genuine company that works off of data and facts.
   Q And if incorrect facts were to be
 perpetuated through the NTSB process, that could
 be detrimental to Oxy Vinyls, correct?

   Q And do you have knowledge of where those
 samples were taken from?
   A I know they were taken. I can't describe
 each sample and the number of samples in the exact
 location, but I know that they were taken from the
 railcar.
   Q Okay. And do you know where the railcars
 were located when those samples were taken?

 situation, but I didn't follow that portion that
 closely.

 moving quickly, it's just out of respect of that
 one hour allotment, okay?

   Q Also, by virtue of kind of going second,
 it will seem like I'm jumping around from topic to
 topic. That is just by virtue of the way it is, I
 think, going second, so I don't mean to confuse
 you or kind of move off track.

 doesn't make sense, you need to clarify it,
 whatever the case might be, I want to make sure
 you understand the question. Just let me know,

   A Okay.
   Q Before I get into some of the topics that
 I have prepared to discuss with you today, I do
 want to revisit some of the things you discussed
 with counsel.
    First, do you recall being asked a series
 of questions about the expectations of Oxy Vinyls,
 specifically expectations of rail carriers as
 shipping Oxy Vinyls' products?
   A I don't -- I think he asked, but I
 don't -- I wouldn't be able to rephrase the
 question.
   Q Fair enough. But you remember generally a
 discussion -
   A Yes.
   Q -- about what those expectations would be,
 right?
   A Yes.
   Q And I think you testified that one of the
 expectations is that rail carriers, Norfolk
 Southern included, would safely ship Oxy Vinyls'
 products throughout the country, right?
   A Correct.
   Q Would you agree that in terms of Class I

 railroads that ship freight throughout the
 country, there's limited competition?
   A Correct, there is limited competition.
   Q Another way of saying that is, there's not
 very many choices for a shipper like Oxy, right?
   A Not many rail shipping options, correct.
   Q Yes, I'm just referring to rail shipment
 right now.
   A Yes.
   Q And that's especially true as you go from
 region to region throughout the United States,
 right?
   A It's really through all the United States.
 You have two Eastern Coast carriers, Norfolk
 Southern and CSX, and two West Coast shippers,
 which is typically BNSF or Union Pacific.
   Q So in the case of Oxy shipping from any of
 its locations, let's say, in Texas to the East
 Coast, there's really only two choices?
   A At the destination on the East Coast,
 that's correct, and obviously sometimes you have
 short line railroads that are the delivering
 carrier but the main haul is one of two eastern
 carriers.
   Q So just referring to those two main

 eastern carriers, I think you said it's Norfolk
 Southern and CSX?
   A CSX.
   Q So is it fair to say that Oxy expects that
 in exchange for that kind of exclusivity, that
 they're going to do a good job with shipping its
 product?
   A I think that's fair of what the shipping
 industry expects, is that our customer -- shipping
 industry, that you expect, whether there's
 competition or not, that the carriers are going to
 perform safely.
   Q But certainly if you don't have much of a
 choice, right, there's all the more reason for
 them to exercise the utmost safety in what they're
 doing, right?
   A I think regardless of competition or not,
 they need to exercise compliance with safety and
 environmental regulations as well as performance.
   Q Fair enough. But it's not like you have
 much choice if in this case Norfolk Southern isn't
 shipping your product via the rail in the safest
 manner, right?
   A Correct. The significant portion of our
 line haul or origin destination points are closed,

 meaning there's only one carrier that can perform
 that transportation shipment.
   Q And in this case, at least going from
 La Porte to the facility in New Jersey, that's
 Norfolk Southern, right?
   A Actually, CSX can deliver to the
 New Jersey area and then it's delivered by
 Conrail.
   Q Okay. Understood. But I think you said,
 and maybe this plays into what you talked about
 earlier, that at some point Norfolk Southern won
 over Oxy's business over CSX in that respect,
 right?
   A Correct.
   Q Fair to say that as part of winning that
 business, there were representations made about
 shipping the product safely?
   A Yes. Until this incident, we've had a
 good shipping history performance with the NS, and
 so they have been a carrier that performed.
   Q And as vice president of supply chain for
 Oxy, has this incident changed your perspective on
 the safety that Norfolk Southern employs in
 shipping Oxy's products?
   A Can you repeat that question?

   Q Sure.
    As vice president of supply chain for Oxy,
 has this incident, the derailment in
 East Palestine, changed what you understand to be
 the way that Norfolk Southern supposedly safely
 transports your product to the East Coast?
   A I think we have learned a lot more through
 the investigation process about what it takes to
 safely transport product and the response to an
 incident, and I'll be honest, I think we're
 disappointed in NS's response.
   Q What are you specifically disappointed in?
 When I say "you," I mean Oxy.
   A When I say Oxy disappoint -- I mean, the
 response, the immediate response to the incident,
 and I think from those phone conversations, having
 more leadership, and what were the checkpoints and
 knowledge of their executives, and what was a -
 decision-making controls.
    It appeared that the contractors had a lot

 questioning?
   A Yes.
   Q And I think you said it's been some time
 since you had direct involvement with those
 processes, right?
   A Correct, over a decade.
   Q And I don't want to test your memory on
 this -
   A Thank you.
   Q -- the specifics of that again. But I do
 want to focus on -- on one kind of segment, and
 that is the reaction temperature that you were
 asked about.
    Do you recall generally those questions?
   A Yes.
   Q And correct me if I'm wrong, I think you
 were asked a question about whether that reaction
 temperature, again the reaction for polymerization
 of vinyl chloride, in those facilities takes place
 at less than 150 degrees Fahrenheit.
    Do you remember that?
   A I remember that question, yes.
   Q And I believe you said that yes, it does,
 right?
   A Yes.

   Q But that's in the presence of an
 initiator, right?
   A Absolutely.
   Q That's not the application of heat alone,
 right?
   A Correct.
   Q So we're not to take your testimony
 earlier today to suggest that Oxy applies 150
 degrees of heat to vinyl chloride monomer, and all
 of a sudden it polymerizes, right?
   A Correct. I apologize if that's what was
 interpreted, but when you react vinyl chloride in
 a suspension process with water, you are adding
 organic peroxides, initiators, to initiate the
 reaction, and then you're heating up the reaction.
 But it's in the presence of initiators.
   Q And that's significant for stabilized
 vinyl chloride monomer because stabilized vinyl
 chloride monomer doesn't have those initiators
 present, right?
   A Correct.
   Q I promised you I was going to jump around,
 so I'm going to jump around.
    You discussed with counsel a little
 earlier today the derailment in Paulsboro,

   A Yes.
   Q Paulsboro is just outside of Philadelphia,
 right?
   A Correct.
   Q Major metropolitan city?
   A Yes.
   Q And that derailment occurred November of
 2012, right?
   A Yes.
   Q And you had just stepped into the role of
 director of supply chain?
   A Correct.
   Q So fairly significant event that occurred
 shortly after you entered into or transitioned
 into a new significant role at Oxy, right?
   A Correct.
   Q And I know you said that your involvement
 was not as, I don't want to put words in your
 mouth, but as significant or direct, what have
 you, because you were closing on a house, right?
   A Correct. I would have been responding in
 the SSP room directly for that derailment
 incident. I was called to, but I was in closing
 and so somebody else performed that role.

   Q So with the understanding that you may not
 have had as much direct involvement as you would
 typically have in your role as director of supply
 chain, what can you tell me that you recall about
 any technical assistance that Oxy provided for the
 Paulsboro derailment?
   A Yes, so I know that Tom Woodka, who was a
 Pedricktown plant manager at the time, went to
 meetings and went to the scene. They did not
 appear to need direct help at -- in handling the
 incident, but he was available and also eyes for
 Oxy to communicate what was occurring.
    And, again, you hear a lot on the news
 media, but you also like to have a person present
 to see the actual results and what's occurring,
 the actual events unfolding.
    The only other area of concern that I
 remember hearing about was, I believe the Coast
 Guard was involved because the vinyl chloride
 monomer railcar was in a waterway, and there was
 some thoughts about how to handle that car and the
 release of vinyl chloride as it relates to the
 water, the way it released.
    And so there was -- what I just recall is
 that the Coast Guard doesn't typically have that

 kind of response -- responsibilities, and so that
 added to some confusion.
   Q And with that kind of added element of the
 Coast Guard being involved, was there any, to your
 knowledge, interfacing between Oxy and Coast
 Guard?
   A I don't think so. I just -- I just
 remember that from the incident and the general
 discussions, but I can't speak to anything other
 than Tom Woodka being at times on scene.
   Q Okay. I'm going to ask you a few more
 questions about it, again with the understanding
 that you may not have been as directly involved,
 okay?
   A Okay.
   Q Are you aware that in connection with the
 Paulsboro derailment, the line that the train was
 running on was a shared line between Conrail and
 Norfolk Southern?
   A I know it was a Conrail line, and I know
 Conrail is a joint ownership between CSX and NS.
   Q Okay. And do you recall any involvement
 interactions between the folks at Oxy and Norfolk
 Southern specifically with respect to the
 Paulsboro derailment back in 2012?

   Q Oh, I'm sorry.
   A -- that NS, Norfolk Southern, was not
 carrying our VCM at that time.
   Q It was on a different carrier?
   A It was on the CSX.
   Q Understood.
    Do you have any recollection of whether
 there was an incident or a Unified Command set up
 for that derailment?
   A I do believe there was.
   Q And was the railroad, whether it was
 Conrail, CSX, Norfolk Southern, were they part of
 that Unified Command?
   A I don't recall specifically.
   Q And if you don't know or you don't recall,
 that is totally fine with me.
   A Yes, yep.
   Q Do you recall any specifics about
 interactions between Oxy and the railroad in
 connection with the Paulsboro derailment, whether
 it is CSX, Conrail, or NS?

   Q It goes on to say: For those not
 involved, similar event. The train ran through
 the small bridge/track that was not properly
 latched (as I think I remember) which caused
 derailment and gash in our VCM car and several
 sprawled over the track.
    Did I read that correctly?
   A Yes, you did.
   Q And I think that is consistent with what
 you recalled earlier today that there was one VCM
 car that was breached, right?
   A Correct.

 If I remember correctly, we provided some
 technical advisor service, and they had some dumb
 ideas that we steered them from.
    Did I read that correctly?

    The reference in what I just read to
 technical advisor service, do you have any
 recollection of what that technical advisor
 service was specifically?
   A I don't know specifically, but I believe
 that is why we had Tom Woodka, the local plant
 manager, on the scene, and then if there was
 questions, he could come back just like we had
 with Steve Smith and have access to our technical
 community.

   A "They" being some of the responders
 involved in the Paulsboro incident. I know in
 context it was related to the response ideas, and
 that is why I brought up the Coast Guard and
 possibly handling of the event. Because -
 because it was a waterway, if I recall correctly,
 they were like a lead -- lead agency in the
 effort.

 was going on this. There is a reference to,

 are being referenced here?

 mile, and they talked about structures. I don't
 remember the details from that long ago.
   Q And understanding that you may not recall
 those details, does it sound familiar that the
 evacuation zone was 12 miles?
   A I don't recall that, to be honest.
   Q And does it sound familiar that the
 evacuation zone was implemented for three days?
   A I do know it was multiple days.
   Q And was all concerning one breached vinyl
 chloride monomer car, right?
   A Yes.
   Q And if we fast forward to East Palestine,
 the evacuation zone that was implemented by NS and
 its contractors was one mile, right?
   A I do recall the one mile based on the
 emergency response guide.
   Q Okay. And that is one mile for a town of
 roughly 5,000 people, right?
   A Correct. That's my understanding of the
 population.
   Q And that was -- those were some of the
 factors that Oxy was considering when they were
 presented by NS and its contractors with the idea
 of an evacuation zone, and I think you said it was

 kind of shocking, right?
   A I don't -- I don't want to imply that it
 was one mile versus a 12-mile related to this
 incident. I think what was shocking to us was the
 reporting of a potential BLEVE and then our
 familiarity with what the appropriate evacuation
 zone is relative to a BLEVE.
    And I think after it was presented, we
 understood that a mile, based on the emergency
 response guide, is a standard, but again, when we
 first heard of it, it just seemed concerning.
   Q Okay. So if I understand correctly, what
 was concerning was the idea that you're being
 presented with the potential for a BLEVE, and at
 the same time, the evacuation zone that was at
 least presented at that point in time was limited
 to one mile?
   A Correct.
   Q And that, at least at first, did not
 strike you as consistent?
   A Correct.
   Q Because a BLEVE is a major explosion?
   A Yes, an uncontrolled catastrophic
 explosion.

   Q Yet, I'm sorry. None of the tank cars
 have split yet?
   A Correct.
   Q And: It took some effort by SPSI and NS
 to get the fire responders farther out from the
 hot zone.
    Right?
   A Correct.
   Q And then at least according to this email,
 Drew McCarty believed that all were starting to
 calm down, right?
   A Correct. Well, they say "they," so
 it's -- it would seem like it's Drew since he
 spoke to Drew, but...
   Q Okay. And that their plan, whoever
 "their" is, is to hot tap and liquid flare all
 before they can polymerize.
    Do you see that?

   A Yes.
   Q So there was -- let me withdraw that.
    Having received this email on February
 4th, 2023, and looking at it now, is it your
 understanding that SPSI, and specifically Drew
 McCarty, was concerned about polymerization as
 early as 10:38 in the morning on February 4th,
   A Yes.
   Q And as you sit here today, having been
 involved in the special situations team and
 involved in any other investigations, fair to say
 that there was no data at 10:38 a.m. on February
 4th, 2023, to support any conclusion that
 polymerization was occurring in the VCM cars,
 right?
   A We are -- I'm not -- we are not aware of
 any data that was available at 10:38 to support
 that polymerization was a concern.
   Q Do you have any idea how at 10:38 a.m. on
 February 4th, 2023, Drew McCarty came to start
 thinking about polymerization if there was no data
 to support that?
   A Only from the statements that they shared
 in East Palestine in that public hearing.

   Q The hearings held by the NTSB, that's what
 you're referring to?
   A Yes.
   Q What statements specifically, if I might
 ask?
   A I'm just saying that through that
 process and -- and also on our phone calls, he
 stated that they relied -- I know on our one phone
 call that he relied on his training. I remember
 hearing the training, Pueblo, Colorado.
    And I know Drew's focus -- he heard our
 discussions Saturday night and then Sunday
 morning, and again, I think Saturday night was, I
 hear that you don't think polymerization is a
 concern but that doesn't agree with our training.
    And he and Chip Day kept referencing the
 training that they received, and I think that they
 categorized monomers as a generic class of
 chemicals, "monomers" meaning styrene and other
 monomers.
    And "monomers" is a generic term, and each
 has its own chemical properties and
 characteristics and how they're stabilized and
 what their reaction potential and end product is.

 all monomers the same in an emergency response
 situation, right?
   A Yes, well said. And that would be my
 view. I mean, I think -- but what he was saying
 is he got general monomer training and that's
 how -- I think that's how they approached it.
 Well -- yeah, that would be my view.
   Q So, again, correct me if I'm wrong with
 this, am I to take what you just said, that they,
 being Chip Day and Drew McCarty, put, in your -
 to your mind, put their training over the advice
 that Oxy was giving them?
   A That is my viewpoint that I walked away
 from the phone calls, and then as the actions
 played out, that's how I view the situation.
   Q I want to go back to some of the facts
 that are -- that are put forward in this -- in
 this email here. Again, we're talking about a
 conversation that, by the looks of this email,
 took place before 10:38 Saturday, February 4th,
 right?
   A Right, and we were notified at 8:40.
   Q And, again, there's a concern at that
 point from folks, including Drew McCarty, about
 polymerization, right?

   A And I would say even before then, because
 this is Robyn emailing it at 10:38, but they had
 already had a conversation, so I would say it was
 even earlier than 10:38.
   Q So we don't know how early or how much
 earlier that -
   A Correct.
   Q -- that might have happened?
   A Correct.
   Q But at the latest 10:38, right?
   A Correct.
   Q Now, you have come to learn that between
 when the derailment happened, the evening of
 February 3rd, to this point in time, 10:38 a.m.
 February 4th, the PRDs for the vinyl chloride
 monomer cars had been activating, right?
   A They had been -- yes, they had been
 cycling and activating, opening and then
 resealing, closing, and cycling on like a
 two-minute or, you know, often period.
   Q And understanding you may not know the
 specifics of how often they were cycling, is it
 fair to say you understand that they were
 continuously cycling over that period?
   A Yes, it was like an eight or nine-hour

 period, because they reported that on the call
 that Saturday evening.
   Q So if we look at this email, there's a
 concern polymerization may occur, but there's no
 indication that they believed polymerization had
 already occurred, right?
   A It may occur at this time, of this email.
   Q At it may -- it may occur after the point
 in time of this email, right?
   A Based on the way that Robyn summarized the
 discussion with Drew McCarty.
   Q Understood.
    So fair to say that you interpret this
 email as Drew McCarty, SPSI, and potentially
 others, believing polymerization might happen in
 the future even though the PRDs had already been
 continuously cycling since the train's -- since
 the train derailed the night of February 3rd?
   A And I don't put as much credibility in
 this email as much as the Saturday evening call
 where he kind of recapped the day's events and
 what his observations were, but they aligned with
 what is in this email.
   Q Understood.

 Ms. Stegmann, is at some point when -- later on
 Saturday when you have the conference call with
 Drew McCarty and others, that's when you-all at
 Oxy are first told, we're concerned polymerization
 is occurring in the cars, right?
   A Correct.
   Q And the data point cited to you-all at Oxy
 as to why polymerization is occurring, is the
 activation of the PRD devices, right?
   A It was specifically the energetic release
 of the -- the one car, I believe it was the third
 car in the derailment, I don't recall the number,
 but it was the third one, and it released for 60
 to 70 minutes. And they felt like that energetic
 release was an indication of a reaction occurring
 and polymerization, and it's -- it's that -- that
 was at one point discussed as a concern.
   Q But PRDs activating is not a sign of
 polymerization, right?
   A No. That's how they normally operate.
   Q In fact, the PRDs activating helps to
 reduce the pressure within the cars, right?
   A Correct. It's part of the thermal
 protection system of a railcar.
   Q And the PRDs activating have a downstream

 effect on managing the temperature within the cars
 as well, right?
   A The vinyl -- vinyl flashing actually
 provides a cooling effect within the railcar.
   Q So fair to say as you sit here today, you
 don't believe that the PRDs activating, even
 energetically later in the day, were any
 indication of polymerization occurring in those
 cars?
   A No, I actually believe it was all normal
 course of action for the PRD and the way -- the
 way you would have expected the relief valves to
 be reacting -- performing.
   Q I'm going to mark for you now as Exhibit
 11 this document. Once you've had a chance to
 look at that, I will ask you some questions.
    (Exhibit 11 marked.)
    MR. GOMEZ: And I apologize, Counsel, that
 I didn't upload the prior document, but I think
 you-all should have it.
   A Yes, I'm familiar. I have read the
 document.
   Q You have read that document, which is
 actually -- let's see, it is Group D, Exhibit 31

   A Yes. It was part of that exhibit.
   Q Okay. And the title from the NTSB
 investigation is Oxy Vinyls' letter to NTSB
 referencing SDS sourced documents April 11th,
 2022. It's the first on the cover page; is that
 correct?
   A Yes.
   Q And the actual substantive document
 appears to be an April 11th, 2023 letter that you
 authored, right?
   A I did not author. It was written, and I
 reviewed and signed as the party representative.
   Q Fair enough. It was submitted by you?
   A By me as the party representative to the
 investigation.
   Q Okay. And am I correct that the purpose
 of this letter that was submitted by you was to
 provide the NTSB with information regarding the
 safety data sheet for vinyl chloride monomer?
   A Yes. They had a request -- this was one
 of their many requests for information, and I
 believe it was -- they wanted the source documents
 that our SDSs were based off of.

 you submitted this letter to the NTSB that one of

 the reasons why this information was being
 requested of you was questions about what the SDS
 says regarding polymerization?
   A Yes. We realized it was being challenged.
   Q And SDS is an OSHA requirement, isn't it?
   A It is a OSHA hazardous communications
 requirement, yes.
   Q And the intention of that document is to
 protect anyone downstream of the product
 manufacturer who may come in contact with the
 chemical, right?
   A Can you repeat that?
   Q Sure. The purpose of that document is to
 provide information to anyone downstream of the
 manufacturer about the propensities or the
 properties of the chemical, right?
   A I think it's broader than that. It is
 anybody working in our facility.
   Q Okay.
   A And even us as a user -- you know, general
 user within our organization. So it is a broad
 communication document for industrial uses, even
 within our own facility or by our contractor.

   A Broad audience and a wide range of
 applicability.
   Q And that is why it's a standardized
 document, right?
   A Correct.
   Q So that it provides certain standard
 information, regardless of what chemical?
   A In a consistent format, regardless of the
 chemical so that you -- you're looking at a
 similar format, similar content across a wide
 range of chemicals.
   Q And that helps it be used as a quick
 reference in an immediate response action, right?
   A Correct, or a familiar reference.
   Q In your experience with supply chain, can
 you just describe for me what some of the
 different settings and users that might come into
 contact with VCM might be?

   A Correct, to customers really, customers.
   Q And customers that might be in different
 settings. For example, some might in laboratory,
 some might be warehouses, some might be in an
 industrial processing facility?
   A General processing facilities because of
 the quantity of a railcar, but, again, they might
 have different applications.
   Q And other people might be -- might come
 into contact with at least the -- the vessel that
 is shipping the vinyl chloride monomer along the
 way, right?

   Q Yes, there could be sailors, right?
   A I don't know, in general -
   Q It could be anybody?

 supposed to provide information independent of the
 specific setting in which someone may interact
 with vinyl chloride monomer, right?

   A Again, it's a broad communication document
 used to communicate potential hazards in a wide
 range of settings.
   Q It's not supposed to be the last word on
 how to handle a specific emergency response
 situation, right?
   A It is a source document and a tool.
   Q Just one tool in the toolbox?
   A Correct.
   Q What are some of the other tools in the
 toolbox?
   A Well, if you look in this case, we
 provided technical assistance via communications,
 phone, meetings. We also, as a -- from our
 product ownership, we sent folks to East Palestine
 to be on the ground, you know, again, having that
 face-to-face interaction.
    So there is different tools that can be
 utilized, and this is just one tool and one
 mechanism to communicate.
    There is also the Rail Ask app, I think
 that is what it is called, but they're the -
 the -- the railroad industry has been trying to
 use apps to communicate SDSs or emergency guidance

 recall, if at all, whether Robert Wood from
 Norfolk Southern was on the -- was on the call?

   A It was basically in reference to if
 polymerization didn't occur, his question or

 wanted to know if they should do a vent-and-burn.
 And he basically said it would have been nice to
 know when they -- we were talking about
 polymerization.

 discussions that took place during this meeting?
   A I just remember John Tummons presenting
 the analytical approach, I think, the technology,
 the methods, and talking about the collection
 sample.
    So I just know it was our technical team
 and they were communicating, and the reason I
 remember the meeting is I held over after the
 meeting to talk to the NTSB folks, Mr. Stancil and
 Mr. Dougherty, for the first time. And that was
 going to be my orientation to being a party
 representative based on being -- joining their
 work stream.
   Q Do you recall if during this meeting any
 of the other parties to the NTSB investigation
 that may have participated in the call expressed
 concerns or criticisms about the testing that Oxy
 did?
   A No, I don't recall. I just remember
 Chief Drabick at the end making a -- a comment.
   Q You also mentioned earlier that there were
 some comments made in the aftermath of derailment
 and the vent-and-burn by public officials.

    Do you recall talking about that?
   A Yes.
   Q I think you said that there was some
 comments made by the FRA and the NTSB, right?
   A At the February -- are we talking about -
   Q No, I'm sorry, in the immediate aftermath.
 I think you mentioned, at least with respect to
 the FRA, there was a video of -
   A February 23rd.
   Q I'm sorry. Can you just -- can you just
 describe that for me again?
   A I just remember there being a video
 February 23rd, and I remember Karl Alexy
 walking -- I think it's when he -- DOT Peter
 Buttigieg visited the site, if I remember the
 video correctly, and they were touring the
 derailment site. And I remember Karl Alexy being
 there, Randy Keltz.
    And listening to the video, you can see
 them pointing and he said something about
 polymerization, and I found that odd because he's
 an FRA hazmat technical railcar investigator
 manager.
   Q And there was also a comment you alluded
 to earlier from Chair Homendy, I believe, right?

   A She did a press conference. That may have
 been the same day or a different day where she
 gave one of her press updates, and it was her and
 then Robert Hall came up to the podium.
   Q And both of these comments that you just
 identified, those were made after Oxy had multiple
 times between February 4th and February 6th
 advised Norfolk Southern and its contractors that
 polymerization was not occurring, right?
   A Correct.
   Q And fair to say that those comments from
 the FRA and the NTSB that you just identified were
 surprising in light of the conclusions Oxy had
 been sharing with Norfolk Southern and its
 contractors in the days leading up to the
 vent-and-burn?
   A They were surprising that they were
 continuing to get so much media attention that it
 was being communicated in the media, and again, we
 felt like this whole process was supposed to be a
 fact-finding, go determine the facts, versus
 people just commenting on what they learned or
 thought they learned being part of Unified
 Command.

 information Oxy was providing to Norfolk Southern
 and its contractors specifically about
 polymerization between the 4th and the 6th of
 February was being shared with Unified Command?
   A Yes. I mean, that it was our
 understanding. I believe Steve Smith spoke to
 Paul Williams of the NS and got direction on how
 they wanted us communicating to NS or the
 contractors, and so obviously if those
 communications were occurring, it would be our
 expectation that those -- that information be
 supplied through the Unified Command System.
   Q And as you sit here today, do you know
 whether NS and its contractors actually provided
 that information to Unified Command before the
 vent-and-burn took place?
   A I personally do not know. Obviously, some
 of that dialogue or lack of dialogue came out in
 the investigative hearings in East Palestine.
   Q And it came out in that comment that
 Chief Drabick made during the phone call we just
 discussed, right?
   A Correct.

 that Oxy concluded polymerization wasn't

   A And he also would not have -- I think he
 spoke to that at the hearing. There was some
 hearing references where he talked about what was
 not shared or he was not informed of.
    MR. GOMEZ: Could we go off the record?
    VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the

 questions with you as quick as I can,
 Ms. Stegmann.
    I want to switch gears to a different

 discussed in Panel 4 was the significance of the
 presence of certain aluminum components on the
 VCM-containing railcars.
    Do you recall that?
   A Yes, I do.
   Q And there was also some discussion about
 acetylides; is that correct?
   A Correct.
   Q Am I pronouncing that correctly?
   A Acetylides, yes.
   Q Okay, great.
    Do you know what the significance of
 acetylides in transportation specifically via
 pressurized tanker car is?
   A We provided a document to the NTSB
 addressing that. That was one of our first
 requests. So I need to be -- I think actually
 that was part of the hearing so it's a public
 document.
    I believe the concern was that, could it
 potentially act as a catalyst if the -- if the
 aluminum and VCM were to react, could it be
 part -- could it then produce an acetylide that
 could be a catalyst.
    So it was a far reach in trying to draw

 some, I guess, hypothesis.
   Q And I want to get into some of that with
 you -
   A Yes.
   Q -- but I guess just as a general matter,
 what I'm still struggling to understand, candidly,
 is whether the issue with acetylides, and tell me
 if I'm wrong, is that they in and of themselves
 are hazardous, or in connection with VCM can serve
 as a catalyst for polymerization?
   A I believe it's the later is what was the
 theory, but again, I think John Tummons and the
 folks that produced the technical information to
 support that letter and position are the correct
 resources.
   Q And acetylides are specifically an issue
 because there are certain transportation
 regulations that apply to prevent the formation of
 acetylides, right?
   A You're -- you're going to get past my -- I
 wasn't even familiar with acetylides until it was
 brought up by the NTSB in asking us about VCM and
 aluminum and us having to do the research to
 address it as a non-concern.

 panel to talk about acetylides, among other
 things, if it's outside of kind of your technical
 expertise?
   A They didn't really go there as much as
 they wanted a shipper. They wanted Oxy to be on
 the panel as a shipper representing the overall
 tank car, and I believe I was there to address
 some of the FRA observations. And then I believe
 GATX was asked to be part of the hearing, and they
 did not participate in a hearing.
   Q So full disclosure, I'm going to ask you
 some questions about this topic because you were
 on that panel -
   A Yes.

    Once you've had a chance to kind of orient
 yourself and look at it, let me know and I'll ask

 looked through it extensively.
   Q Okay. Well, fair to say that in the
 aftermath of the East Palestine derailment, you
 are now familiar with at least Special Provision
 B44, right?
   A I -- I know that B44 -- yes, I have become
 aware of it and understand it is referenced.
   Q Okay.
   A I think even on our SDS.
   Q And that is -- that special provision
 appears on page 373 of this document, right?
   A Yes.
   Q And it reads: All parts of valves and
 safety relief devices in contact with lading must
 be of a material which will not cause formulation
 of acetylides.
    Did I read that correctly?
   A Correct.
   Q This was one of the special provisions
 that was discussed at the NTSB hearings -
   A Yes, it was.
   Q -- right? And this was one of the special
 provisions that the FRA took exception to in
 connection with some of the VCM cars, right?

 this one.
   Q Okay. I want to talk specifically about
 what the FRA said and what -
   A Okay.
   Q -- and what they've put forward, but
 first, just so we can get our bearings on B44, B44
 is not specific to VCM, right?
   A Correct. I mean, that's why they
 reference it this way, so then different
 commodities they can then reference each of these.
 I'm not sure how you do it, but whatever the B44
 represents.
   Q Uh-huh.
   A There's a term. I forget what it is, but
 correct, these aren't specific, and then each
 chemical in the hazmat table references these.
   Q VCM happens to be one of the chemicals
 that's subject to B44 -
   A Correct.
   Q -- but it's not the whole chemical?
   A Not specific, correct.
   Q B44 is also not specific to aluminum,
 right?
   A Correct. I do believe there's another
 metal. I can't -- I can't recall. It may be

 copper, but I don't recall that for sure.
   Q In fact, if we just look at what B44 says,
 it is not specific to any particular construction
 material, right?
   A You're getting outside my area of comfort.
   Q Fair enough. Can we agree that B44 simply
 says that when you are shipping certain types of
 chemicals, you can't do it in a -- in a vessel
 that is constructed out of materials that are
 going to cause acetylides?
   A Correct.
   Q That is just a plain understanding of what
 B44 says, right?
   A Correct.
   Q Okay.
   A You said vessel. It is all parts of
 valves and safety relief devices.
   Q Oh, I'm sorry. So let me rephrase that.
   A Yes.
   Q Let me rephrase that.
    Generally, B44 can we agree means that the
 valves and -
   A Safety relief devices can contact with
 lading, because not all parts of the valves and
 relief valve are in contact with the lading.

   Q So generally -
   A Like the hand wheel and the angle valve is
 not in contact with the lading.
   Q Understood. So generally what we take
 away from it is these -- these -
   A The wetted parts.
   Q -- these features, if they're coming in
 contact with the lading, they can't be such that
 they're going to cause the formation of
 acetylides?
   A Correct.
   Q Just the general, kind of big picture
 takeaway from it?
   A Yes.
   Q Okay. Let's mark as Exhibit 14 a document
 that was brought up during the NTSB hearings.
 Again, same instruction, take a look at it, and

 Exhibit 14 is actually a document that is labeled
 Group H, Exhibit 1 to the NTSB hearings, right?

 FRA-VCM Tank Car Approval Sample Summary, right?
   A That is correct. That is how it is
 titled.
   Q And it looks to be substantively a
 two-page document that if I understand correctly
 was prepared by the FRA, right?
   A Yes.
   Q And you were asked some questions on the
 panel during the NTSB investigations about some of
 the observations that the FRA makes in this

 just two weeks prior to the investigative hearing.

 it only went to the folks who were going to

 investigation at that time. I don't know who had
 access to what.
   Q Okay. So let me just ask the question
 generally then.
    Do you know how much time Oxy had with
 this document, if any, before the investigative
 hearings?
   A Approximately two weeks, and during that
 time period, we were reviewing many documents,
 including 150 pages of documents that NS submitted
 and were uploaded just prior to the hearing, which
 were the first time we saw those documents,
 meaning, we did not have time just to focus on
 this one document. There was many documents
 coming in, and some that we were seeing for the
 first time.
    Which I probably need -- well, I guess I
 have to be careful what I say there because I
 don't know what part of that is public, but I know
 that that's public, the hearing docket that -
   Q So it is my intention to ask you only
 about what the document -
   A Yeah.

 about, but again, if I cross into anything -

   A I just have to remember.
   Q -- just let me know.
   A Yes.
   Q So looking at this document, and with the
 understanding that at least as of the time of the
 NTSB investigative hearings, you-all at Oxy did
 not have a lot of time to go through this in
 detail, is it fair to say that the FRA's
 observations in this document kind of set forth
 two alleged types of violations with respect to
 the railcars, one being kind of paperwork
 violations, and then the other being construction
 violations?
   A I -- no, I don't agree with that
 statement. I believe they were making
 observations, but I would say all of the
 identified observations are relative to our
 recordkeeping and administrative approval
 processes.
    I take exception to any comment of a
 deficiency in the construction or design of any of
 the railcars.
   Q Okay.
   A I believe we looked at the technical
 details of the railcars, meaning the relief valves

 all have to have their own separate AAR approvals,
 the valves have to have their own AAR approvals,
 all of the equipment on the railcars approved, the
 design, the certificate of constructions were all
 AAR approved.
    What the FRA took exception to is they
 tried to state that some of the component changes
 or upgrades did not have approval at that time to
 put on that railcar.
    But all of the components put on these
 railcars had their own separate approvals, meaning
 a Midland company had their relief valves
 approved, it had to have a 4-7 form.
    So I very strongly tried to state there
 was no physical construction, design, or
 engineering concerns related to the five DOT 105
 cars, and I do not own the Trinity car or the GATX
 car, and GATX was not at the hearing to speak to

    However, in our review and comparison of
 all the technical components, the physical

 documentation, a signature missing by an Oxy
 person before putting it in a file.
    I struggle to think, given the extent of
 the environmental concerns with the chemicals that
 breached in the DOT 111, cars that it was
 important to have Oxy come talk about a paperwork
 documentation process, but that is what I was
 there to do.
   Q Understood. And that is what I want to
 talk to you about.
   A And so in your -- so I want to clarify
 your question. I agree that this form or their
 observations center around our administrative
 documentation and as it relates to the approval
 process in the AAR tank car guideline.
   Q So let me ask the question kind of a
 different way.
   A Okay. Sorry, I just wanted to be clear.
   Q No, and I want to make sure that I
 understand your testimony.
   A Yeah.
   Q So let me ask it a different way. As a

   Q -- what is your understanding of any
 issues the FRA took, if any, with the presence of
 aluminum components in the VCM-containing
 railcars?
   A I don't think from a materials standpoint,
 they took any concerns. If anything, they were
 talking about whether we had a form filled out
 getting the AAR tank car committee. I think
 another way to put it is, FRA has not issued us
 any notice of violation regarding these railcars.
 We have not received any formal final notice of
 violation from the FRA.
   Q And so that's the FRA. Has the -- let me
 withdraw that.
   A And I can't speak to the NTSB because that
 report is not issued and -- and so other than me
 testifying in the FRA -- what I think is -- is
 unusual, too, if you look at here, do they
 reference any federal code or regulation?
   Q Well, why don't we look at the second page
 of the substantive document at least. And I'm
 looking at -- let's see. There's a section that
 starts AAR Form 4-2 with AAR Number F916110.
    Do you see that?
   A Yes, uh-huh.

   Q And I don't want to read the whole thing
 into the record, but there's a subparagraph that
 says: However, current service, vinyl chloride,
 is a hazard class 2.1 which 49 CFR 173.314(j)
 specifically states special commodity requirements
 for materials having a primary or secondary
 division 2.1 (flammable gas) hazard.
    Did I read that correctly?
   A Yes.
   Q Do you understand that comment that I just
 read to reference in any way the special handling
 provision B44 that we talked about?
   A I think for me to answer that, it's a more
 complex reference, and I would want all the
 hazardous material regulations out. I believe
 that these are commodity requirements, and there's
 also a specialty commodity requirement and I
 believe that relates to the excess flow valve.
    What I can state is Oxy has documented its
 opinion on this document to the NTSB which has not
 been released. However, we technically reviewed
 that with all parties in the investigation, and I
 think I will just leave it at that for now.
    So we have submitted our position, and

 to be able to summarize in just a few sentences.
 However, what I can state is we believe all five
 cars are approved for vinyl chloride monomer
 service. In this special provision is -- in this
 DOT 173 is a common reference among the railcar
 lessor industry, and I believe that there's other
 folks that have also contributed information in
 alignment with our position that the car is
 approved for vinyl chloride monomer service
 including the railcar owner.
   Q Again, the document we're looking at, that
 was generated by the FRA, correct?
   A Right.
   Q I want to show you now a document that is
 also part of the NTSB investigation. We'll mark
 that as Exhibit 15.

 look at it, let me know, and I will ask you my
 questions.

   Q Ms. Stegmann, putting aside the
 information you've learned as part of the NTSB
 investigation, do you have any sense of why the
 relationship between aluminum VCM and acetylides
 has been discussed in connection with the
 East Palestine derailment?
   A There's aluminum components and equipment
 on the railcar, and there became concern on the
 exterior of the railcar. So that definitely
 became an area of concern, the hand wheels were
 melted and the protective aluminum housings.
   Q And, again, outside of information you
 have learned from the NTSB investigation -
   A Right.
   Q -- who is it that first, to your
 knowledge, expressed those concerns?
   A I don't know if it was expressed. I
 believe it came up on our March 20th call. I just
 don't know if it was discussed prior to that
 because that was my first entrance into -- and it
 was obviously they had a lot of requests of Oxy,
 and I was very quickly in a two-week period trying
 to get up to speed on a lot of issues.

 response from Oxy as to that question -
   A Correct.
   Q -- right?
    And the response from Oxy is, quote, Oxy
 does not believe it is possible for aluminum and
 VCM to result in the formation of acetylides -
   A Correct.
   Q -- correct?
    The response goes on to say: We have
 identified an external resource, the McKetta
 Encyclopedia of Chemical Processing and Design,
 which indicates aluminum is an acceptable material
 of construction for storage and shipping of VCM.
 For reference, we have attached pictures of the
 applicable pages.
    Did I read that correctly?
   A Correct.
   Q In addition to identifying this resource
 referenced here, the McKetta Encyclopedia of
 Chemical Processing and Design, what, if any,
 additional research did Oxy do internally before
 making the conclusion that it does not believe

 Tummons was my source. He and I met, we crafted
 this email and reviewed it. So he was really the

   A Correct.
   Q You weren't part of the team looking into
 the substance of the question?
   A No. I was at this point -- again, I was
 eleven days or so into the investigation, trying
 to identify what open items we had, tracking down
 and making sure we had the right resources, trying
 to be timely, and to respond timely and
 effectively and efficiently to the NTSB.

   Q Who is Dr. William Carroll?
   A He's a professor at the Indiana
 University, I believe, and he was a Oxy -
 long-term employee for Oxy as a chemist but also
 really as a -- did a lot of advocacy and
 communications for us.
   Q You're speaking about him with some
 fondness. Was he a long-time employee?
   A Oh, he was -- yes, I wish he was my
 chemistry professor. He was -- you could just -
 he was -- broke down communications very easily,
 very easily to understand, and he was actually on
 the same floor when I first moved to Dallas. We
 were located close by as far as offices, and I had
 done -- he had brought folks to the plants, and we
 had done presentations and worked together on
 projects.
   Q And after leaving Oxy, Dr. Carroll formed
 his own company, right?
   A Correct.
   Q I think he does some consulting; is that
 fair?

 Indiana, right?
   A Yes.
   Q If I'm not mistaken, Dr. Carroll was also
 president and chair of the board of the American
 Chemical Society?
   A I believe so.
   Q Fair to say he's a well-respected chemist?
   A Absolutely, by -- by both the technical
 community and just what I would call the layman
 person breaking down into very complex issues that
 are well understood by the general public.
   Q And if I'm not mistaken, Dr. Carroll
 actually helped with preparing this response,
 right?
   A I can't confirm that. I don't recall
 that. He may have.
   Q Let's mark as Exhibit 16 to your
 deposition another document from the NTSB
 investigation.
   A I do think he established he was an
 independent at the NT- -- he was an NTSB witness
 at the hearings. He was not by Oxy.

   Q And it is entitled: Notes of NTSB meeting
 with William Carroll, Ph.D., April 5th, 2023,
 right?
   A That's correct.

 Dr. Carroll regarding certain questions that had
 been posed in connection with the East Palestine
 derailment, fair?

   A Correct. And I would just say a video
 conference call -- yeah, a discussion, yeah. So I
 don't know if it was videoed or that just means it
 was a Teams call type setting.
   Q And if we look at the bullet point that I
 directed you to earlier, again, the third bullet
 point from the bottom of page 3, it says:
 Dr. Carroll assisted in Oxy's response to NTSB
 about whether VCM in the presence of aluminum and
 other metals can for acetylides referenced special
 condition B44 in the HMR.
    Did I read that correctly?
   A Yes, you did.
   Q And it says "for," but can we agree it
 should be "form"?
   A I agree, yes.
   Q Right. Having looked at this document and
 specifically read that sentence, do you now have a
 sense of whether the response we looked at from
 Oxy that you submitted may have been prepared with
 some help from Dr. Carroll?
   A Yes. Those two concepts would correspond.
   Q Okay. And this bullet point goes on to -

 acetylides or carbides tend to be generated at
 very high temperature. For example, calcium
 carbide is generated at 2500 degrees Celsius and
 is a precursor for making acetylene.
    Did I read that correctly?
   A Yes, you did.
   Q It then goes on to say: In the case of
 whether VCM could form aluminum carbide, it cannot
 be produced chemically without the presence of a
 very strong base (such as lithium and liquid
 ammonia).
    Did I read that correctly?
   A Yes.
   Q The PKA for the first hydrogen is about 24
 (the higher the PKA, the less likely the proton
 hydrogen ion is given up) so this reaction is
 beyond the capability of most common bases (or
 neutral VCM in normal transportation scenario).
    Did I read that correctly?
   A Yes, you did.

 in layman's terms?

 discuss, or Dr. Carroll will be able to describe?
   A Absolutely.
   Q Do you have any independent understanding
 of what Dr. Carroll -- or what is being conveyed
 in these notes with the discussion with
 Dr. Carroll regarding why aluminum and VCM cannot
 cause the formation of acetylides?
   A I mean, he's referencing it in the
 hazardous material in reference to Special
 Condition B44.
   Q The one we looked at earlier, right?
   A Yes. That is what the HMR stands for, the
 hazardous material regulations.
   Q And with the understanding that we will
 talk to Dr. Carroll about the specifics of it, it
 looks like there's at least two reasons why
 aluminum and VCM cannot form acetylides. The
 first being the amount of heat needed to -- to
 cause that is exponentially high, right?
   A Yes. I mean, yes, the minimum standard is
 very high.
   Q 2500 degrees Celsius -
   A Degrees Celsius.
   Q -- right? That is about 4,500 degrees
 Fahrenheit. Does that sound right?

   A I haven't done the math, but...
   Q Okay. Putting aside the math, fair to say
 that -
   A Very high.
   Q Fair to say that the temperature in the
 VCM cars in the East Palestine derailment didn't
 approach 4500 degrees Fahrenheit?
   A Not to my knowledge.
   Q And then there is also a reference to a
 second reason, that being that there needs to be
 the presence of a very strong base like lithium or
 liquid ammonia, right?
   A Right.
   Q And that is significant because in the
 East Palestine derailment, the cars containing
 vinyl chloride were never breached, right?
   A Correct.
   Q They never lost containment mechanically
 from the derailment?
   A Right, until they were explosively
 breached in the vent-and-burn process.
   Q So until they were breached in the
 vent-and-burn process, they remained stabilized

 in the presence of aluminum and, you know, I
 assume a significant presence. The only aluminum
 that you could possibly be talking about is the
 aluminum-coated spring.
   Q In the pressure release device, right?
   A In the pressure release device.

   A And that car was never a concern from a
 temperature profile or ever expressed as a
 concern, and actually, Norfolk Southern and its
 contractors on one of our calls talked about
 moving that car.
    Their plan -- remember they always have
 one car of concern in these -- in these
 discussions that we had Saturday and Sunday. It
 was never all five are going to BLEVE. It was
 always a car of concern, and it went from the
 highly energetic relieving car, that third car, to
 the one that then they were taking the temperature
 trend on.
    That TILX car they talked about moving,
 but the only reason they didn't move it is upon
 further investigation, it had a cracked bolster.

   A Correct.
   Q There was no discussion whatsoever about
 aluminum components on those railcars?
   A I do not recall, other than they were
 saying that the hand wheels were -- I think that
 they -- they were damaged externally, right, that
 that's part of the reason they couldn't transload
 the material.
   Q No one ever expressed -- no one being
 Norfolk Southern or its contractors ever expressed
 to Oxy between February 4th and February 6th that
 there was a concern about reactivity because there
 may have been aluminum components on those
 railcars?
   A Correct. There was -- between -- through
 February 6th -- I mean, yes, there was no
 discussion.
   Q So is it also fair to say that from Oxy's
 perspective, the formation of acetylides as a
 result of the presence of aluminum was never a
 concern for deciding to -- to conduct a
 vent-and-burn?
   A No. All of this was very post -- like
 basically in this timeframe, you know, trying to
 put together reasoning, but never discussed at the

 time of the derailment.
   Q At any point in time between the
 vent-and-burn and the present, has someone from
 Norfolk Southern discussed with you the issue of
 formation of acetylides?
   A No.
   Q Do you know if at any point in time
 between the vent-and-burn and the present, anyone
 from Norfolk Southern has discussed the formation
 of acetylides with anyone else at Oxy?
   A Not that I'm aware of.
   Q Is it fair to say that from Oxy's
 perspective, the vent-and-burn was really just a
 rail-clearing exercise?
   A Can you ask that question again?
   Q Sure. Is it fair to say that from Oxy's
 perspective, the vent-and-burn operation was
 primarily designed to clear the rails?
   A I think from Oxy's perspective, the
 vent-and-burn was identified very early in the
 process of handling the incident. And there
 didn't appear to be a stage gate process where we
 reevaluated the conditions and determined if some
 of the previous alternative handling methods could
 have become a solution to handling the railcars.

    I can tell you for sure that NS's return
 to service so quickly after the vent-and-burn
 definitely leaves folks with the impression that
 there was a focus to quickly resume operation, get
 off the media, and move forward.
   Q And that is in part because it seems to
 fly in the face of the advice that Oxy, as the
 product expert, was giving realtime between
 February 4th and February 6th, right?
   A I'm not sure what you mean by that
 statement -
   Q Sure.
   A -- your question.
   Q What you just testified to is derived at
 least in part from the fact that Oxy was giving
 information indicating that polymerization was not
 occurring in those railcars, right?
   A Correct.
   Q And, therefore, polymerization was not a
 reason to conduct the vent-and-burn?
   A Correct.
   Q And that those cars were, in fact, stable
 as far as chemically?
   A Chemically stable, and the -- you know, I
 think at that point, is there any different

 opportunities, because when they first start
 talking about transloading and doing the hot tap,
 that's when the car, that third car, energetically
 for 60 minutes relieved.
    And I agree with them. I would have been
 concerned about putting somebody in that situation
 to do a hot tap, so that's why they backed out.
 But you also have to realize that they were
 putting folks on those railcars that they deemed
 unsafe to strap on explosives on five railcars,
 top and bottom.
   Q That puts people's lives at risk too,
 right?
   A I mean, I get why you did not want to do
 the hot tap with that one railcar relieving for
 60, 70 minutes unexpectedly. But 24 hours had
 passed, that was the last of the PRDs to -- to be
 cycling and relieving, but they were still
 communicating that they felt that these cars were
 at risk of polymerization.
    But it was never really clear to me what
 made it so safe, if you really felt that was the
 concern, to then put somebody to climb up the
 cars, strap on explosives on the top and bottom of
 a railcar, and do that five times.

 questions that have to come out of that

   Q Okay. I wanted to -- if you go to the
 second page of that document, there's a paragraph
 that starts with: In this -- in response to this
 request, Oxy Vinyls provides the following source
 documents for the reference to SDS.
    Do you see that?
   A Yes, I do.
   Q And you see the second bullet point there
 recites the Chlorine Institute and Vinyl Institute

    Do you see that?
   A Yes.
   Q And you may have talked about this
 already, but could you tell us, how did you obtain
 the information about the source documents that
 you listed in this letter?
   A Again, I signed the letter and submitted
 it as the party representative. This was
 developed with our technical group as well as our
 legal representatives and including, I believe,
 Paul Thomas's group.
    So he worked and -- actually, it was Paul
 Thomas's group or HESS group, and they put
 together -- they had access to these documents.

 Vinyls creates its safety data sheet for vinyl

   A I haven't been involved in the creation

 an established SDS, and at times it's been I guess
 reviewed and updated. But I haven't been part of

   Q I'm going to ask you about page 4,
 specifically Section 2.3.
   A Okay.
   Q Ms. Stegmann, what is this document?
   A This is the Pamphlet 171. I believe it
 was developed by the Chlorine Institute in
 conjunction with the Vinyl Institute, and it's
 Vinyl Chloride Monomer Tank Car and Cargo Tank
 Handling Manual.
   Q This is the document that's being
 referenced in the letter that you sent shown in
 Exhibit 11?
   A Yes.
   Q Is that correct?
   A I believe it is. Let me just confirm.
    Yes, that was correct.
   Q And I see you're on page 4. So the second
 paragraph in Section 2.3 states that: Exposure to
 the following conditions or mixtures of the
 following elements and materials can cause

 explosive or violent polymerization.
    Do you see that?
    Air, sunlight, excessive heat, oxidizers,
 catalytic metals such as copper aluminum or
 alloys, and certain catalytic impurities.
    Do you see that?
   A I do see that bulleted, yes.
   Q And the first paragraph above it says
 that: VCM is shipped in a stabilized state, and
 it's generally stable at normal temperatures and
 pressures. However, certain conditions and
 mixtures with certain materials can cause VCM to
 violently polymerize or other hazardous
 conditions.
    So, Ms. Stegmann, this section suggests
 that violent polymerization of VCM can occur upon
 exposure to heat; is that correct?
    MR. GOMEZ: Objection.
   A I think that's an overly simplistic
 statement. Excessive heat is listed, and it -
 it -- it's referencing certain conditions or
 mixtures and certain materials.
    So that's not necessarily applicable to
 the version of VCM that was being shipped from the
 La Porte plant in the five DOT-105J cars.

   Q Is that because the VCM being shipped is
 stabilized?
   A It's stabilized and very pure. It's our
 purest form. It's our final product.
    This talks about certain conditions or
 mixtures with certain materials, so it's not
 talking about purity so I can't apply this
 statement to our purest vinyl product out of our
 VCM plants.
   Q Right. So what you're -- if I understand
 correctly, you're saying that you agree this
 section references VCM, but it may not be the same
 VCM that you're shipping?
    MS. BROZ: Objection, form.
   A It -- it doesn't clearly state that it
 relates to our situation, knowing "certain
 conditions and mixtures" is a generic statement.
 And the vinyl shipped at the La Porte plant was
 our purest vinyl product. There's not impurities
 to the extent that you have in other parts of your
 process.
   Q Notwithstanding the vinyl chloride monomer
 that you're shipping, do you think a fair reading
 of the second paragraph is that excessive heat can
 cause violent polymerization?

    MS. BROZ: Objection, form.
   A Could you rephrase the question?
   Q Well, I'm just asking for a fair reading
 of the paragraph, its plain meaning, do you think
 it is saying that excessive heat can cause violent
 polymerization?
    MS. BROZ: Objection, form.
   A It doesn't say -- it says: Exposure to
 the following conditions or mixtures.
    It doesn't say one condition. It could be
 multiple conditions. So I think it's a generic
 guideline that would then need to be further
 clarified.
    It says "exposure to the following
 conditions." It doesn't say "condition" as being
 one.
    "Or mixtures with the following elements
 and materials," so there's a lot of plural
 references there, not just referencing one
 specific point below.
   Q So is your position that a fair reading of
 this paragraph is that it does not suggest that
 excessive heat can result in violent
 polymerization?
    MS. BROZ: Objection, form.

   A I think when I read this paragraph it says
 polymerization and other reaction considerations,
 and I think it would require additional
 understanding and follow-up.
   Q So if I understand a plain reading of the
 second paragraph -- strike that.
    If I understand correctly, what you're
 saying is that one can't really tell what this
 paragraph is saying under a plain reading?
    MS. BROZ: Objection, form.
   A I think it's raising certain reaction
 considerations to identify and be cautious of.
 However, I would put it in the entirety of this
 document which I have not read in its entirety, I
 think we have to be very careful about taking out
 a very small parcel and applying it to an
 extraordinary circumstance.
   Q Well, and the -- are you aware of any
 condition under which aluminum will cause VCM to
 violently polymerize?

 which excessive heating will cause VCM to
 violently polymerize?

   Q I want to show you what's going to be
 marked as Exhibit 18.
    Before we go on to that, just let me back
 up, one question. Are you aware of whether anyone
 at Oxy has communicated with Chlorine Institute
 about changing the contents of this pamphlet?

   A I am not aware of any specific
 communication.
   Q Do you think that it would be a good idea
 to make Section 2.3 more clear?

   A I think since all of these have been
 turned into the NTSB investigation, and since I'm
 a party representative and these are the items
 being discussed, I have to -- I think I need to
 not answer what my belief is as part of the
 investigation.
   Q Well, have you heard anyone at Oxy Vinyls
 suggest that Pamphlet 171 should be updated?
   A I think there has been discussions. Like

 come up with different scenarios.

 stamped on the lower right, but some of these
 documents -
    MS. BROZ: When they're native production,
 there's a slip sheet with the Bates stamp in front
 of it.
    MR. KNIGHT: Okay.
   A I mean, this could be a technical plant

 first sentence states that: VCM will polymerize
 if exposed to air, elevated temperatures, or other
 activating substances.
    Do you agree with that sentence?
   A Well, I'm not the VCM technical steward.

 there needs to be some qualifiers, but again, I
 don't know where this document -- what its purpose
 is, where its source is.

 polymerize. It needs an initiator, in my view.
   Q And oxygen is not an initiator, correct?
   A I think you need -- again, you're getting
 outside my chemistry current knowledge. This
 isn't what I do in my current role and
 responsibility. I've been 10 years removed from
 the manufacturing processes.
   Q So you're not sure whether VCM will
 polymerize at this exposed elevated temperature?
 Is that your testimony?
   A I'm just saying -
    MS. BROZ: Objection to form.
   A -- under oath, I'm not going to testify to
 the technical correctness of a document I have not
 seen or recall seeing.
   Q And the third sentence states that: VCM
 can be stored in vessels made of common materials
 of construction. VCM is stable with common metals

 aluminum?

 make these statements, and I'm looking to see what
 the date is. I mean, this is prepared in 2008 and
 revised in 2013. I haven't recalled seeing it.
 So I don't think that I am the correct Oxy
 representative to be commenting on a technical
 document that I have not seen before.
   Q Well, you don't agree that vinyl chloride
 monomer will react with aluminum, correct?
    MS. BROZ: Objection, form, asked and
 answered.
   A Can you restate the question?
   Q Well, you think that vinyl chloride
 monomer won't react with aluminum; is that
 correct?
    MS. BROZ: Objection, form, asked and
 answered.
   A Again, as party representative, I pass
 along information related to what our technical
 folks supplied regarding VCM and polymerization as
 it relates to metals or it will not polymerize.
    I do not believe it will polymerize, but
 again, I don't know the source of this document,
 and I can't testify to the accuracy or technical
 correctness of this document.
   Q Okay. Thank you.

    I wanted to switch topics a little bit to
 the decision to undertake a vent-and-burn in the
 East Palestine, Ohio derailment. I'm going to
 show you what is going to be marked as Exhibit 19.
    (Exhibit 19 marked.)
   Q So, Ms. Stegmann, what is this document?
   A It looks like a transcript of Day 1
 hearings, so -- of East Palestine, so it's the
 first -- I guess the first and second panel.
   Q Okay. I'm going to ask you to turn to
 page 190 as it's numbered on the little corners
 inside the page. Just let me know when you are
 there.
   A I'm on 190.
   Q Okay. And starting on Line 3, there's a
 Mr. Dougherty who asks a question. And -- first
 of all, who is Mr. Dougherty in relation to the
 NTSB hearing?
   A He was an investigator in the hazardous
 materials group, and I believe he was the lead
 until he resigned from the NTSB.
   Q And you're saying that as of now, he's
 resigned from the NTSB?
   A Correct.
   Q When did that happen, if you know?

   A Yeah, I do. He went out on a month
 medical leave, and then did not return. So
 October-ish time frame.
   Q And Mr. Dougherty asked Mr. Wood: Could
 you describe the process of vent-and-burn, why and
 when it is used and what other options you
 considered in this incident?
    And my next question is, who is Mr. Wood?
   A That is Robert Wood of the NS. He was
 onsite at the derailment scene. I don't remember
 his official title.
   Q And starting at Line 7, Mr. Wood answers
 that: Again, in all cases with tank cars,
 specifically in this case with pressure tank cars
 carrying a liquified flammable gas, your first
 option is damage assessment, can that car be moved
 in any position that it's in, can the car be
 re-railed. In that case, re-railing was never
 going to be an option with this car due to the
 site.
   A I don't know which car he's specifying
 because he says, can the car.
   Q Okay. Well, let me ask you this: Do you
 think that any of the cars could have been
 re-railed?

   A I'm definitely not -- I wasn't on scene.
 That is not my area. I've never made that
 decision.
    However, what I can tell you from
 communications is it -- and it's early, so
 obviously more facts could have came in, but my
 point was they brought up that that first car, the
 TILX car, they proposed moving that because it was
 at the beginning of the derailment scene, and the
 tracks ahead of it could be cleared.
    However, then they recognized that it had
 a cracked bolster, and it was no longer a
 candidate for movement.
    However, that's an extreme jump from, we
 can move this car, it is safe enough to move.
 Other cars have -- that have been in this kind of
 incident have had cracked bolsters and you're able
 to transload them.
    So we went from potentially moving the car
 to the only disposition of the material was a
 vent-and-burn, a last-resort process.
   Q And just so I understand, what is -- when
 you say "transloading," what does that refer to?
   A That is where you move material out of a
 railcar into another railcar, and there is -- it's

 a process of digging up hoses and transloading
 cars. It is common if they're moved on the
 railway and there is an issue with the car.
   Q And do you have an opinion of whether
 transloading was an option with the TILX car?
    MR. SWANSON: Objection, form.
   A I wasn't on site. I don't have near the
 details.
    MR. SWANSON: Objection, form.
   A All I'm pointing out is that we went from
 having immovable thought -- initially immovable
 car to now we need to vent-and-burn all five
 railcars.
   Q Okay. We'll get to the vent-and-burn, but
 first, starting on line 15, Mr. Wood continues:
 The car in that state is never where you truly are
 able to do a full damage assessment on them
 because of their position, the extensive fire
 damage. So between mechanical damages, fire
 damages to the car, part of our decision tree
 becomes, how am I going to get that product out of
 the car? In this case extensive fire damage
 ultimately destroyed the valving on the top of the
 cars, so offloading these cars by normal means was
 not an option.

    My question is, are you aware of any
 reason to disagree with that assessment?
    MR. SWANSON: Object to form.
    MS. BROZ: Objection, form.
   A Can you repeat -- I know you read it, can
 you repeat what your question is?
   Q Well, are you aware of any reason to
 disagree with the assessment that extensive fire
 damage ultimately destroyed the valving on the top
 of the cars so that offloading these cars by
 normal means was not an option?
    MS. BROZ: Objection, form.
   A He's talking -- this references cars and
 I'm not sure which cars he's talking about, and
 again, I'm not -- I wasn't on scene. I don't have
 the experience or knowledge to discuss which
 method and what methods were available.
    All I was stating is there was a change in
 my prior testimony in having a potentially movable
 car to now including it in a vent-and-burn
 process, because it appeared to NS and its
 contractors that one or two of the cars were
 instable, and therefore, if they vent and burned
 one car, they needed to vent-and-burn all five.
    That was the discussions that were

 occurring and the movement of plans throughout the
 process communicated to Oxy.
   Q And then continuing on to the next page,
 page 191, Mr. Wood states that: The next step
 would have been to try to hot tap these cars.
 Again, when we were -- our contractors were trying
 to do a more extensive damage assessment to assess
 these cars. Absent pool fires for several cars,
 one of these cars' PRD suddenly went off again and
 went off for about 70 minutes leading to -- there
 was other safety issues associated with these cars
 that we had to deal with.
    Ultimately it was decided because of the
 time it would take and the peril it would put
 personnel in to try to weld fittings into these
 cars and manually drill holes, to do a hot tap.
 That was not an alternative.
    Do you have any opinion of whether it
 would have been safe to perform a hot tap on any
 of these cars?
    MS. BROZ: Objection, form, foundation.
   A Again, I was not onsite, and I do think
 that there had to be consideration for the safety
 of the personnel performing any tasks at the
 derailment scene, including did they consider

 those same requirements when a gentleman went on
 top of the railcars and strapped explosives on the
 top and bottom of the railcars.
   Q Do -- do you have an understanding of the
 safety considerations associated with performing a
 hot tap?
   A I understand it's a risky situation
 that's -- and one that's been done in our
 processing plants and obviously you're putting
 people in harm's way. But, again, the folks on
 scene are the experts in managing and applying
 those techniques, so I'm not questioning the
 validity of the statement.

 happy to yield any of my time to anybody else who
 wants to ask questions. Really, really appreciate
