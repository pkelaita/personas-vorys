I understand you work\nfor Norfolk Southern.\nIs that right?\nA.   That's correct.\nQ.   And you had some role and\ninvolvement in the derailment of Train 32N or\nat least the response to the derailment?\nMS. PETTY: Objection.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:",
  "Q.   Withdrawn.\nYou had some role and\ninvolvement in Norfolk Southern's response to\nthe derailment of Train 32N in East\nPalestine, Ohio.\nIs that right, sir?\nA.   That's correct.\nQ.   All right. My name's Dave\nBuchanan. I represent, you know, folks in\nEast Palestine and elsewhere that have been\nimpacted by that derailment.\nI take it you're not surprised\nto find yourself in that chair today.\nAre you, sir?\nMS. PETTY: Objection.\nTHE WITNESS: I knew lawsuits\nhad been filed.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:\nQ.   You understand people have been\nimpacted by the events of February 3rd and\nthereafter.\nCorrect?\nMS. PETTY: Objection.\nFoundation.\nTHE WITNESS: There had been\npeople displaced as a result of the\nderailment. I do know that.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:\nQ.   Pretty significant event.\nFair to say?\nMS. PETTY: Objection.\nTHE WITNESS: Yes, it was a\nlarge derailment.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:\nQ.   Been deposed before?\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   Similar situations like this,\nderailments, 17 HAZMAT cars, fires, pool\nfires hundreds of yards in length, vent and\nburns? Been deposed in cases like that\nbefore, sir?\nMS.

PETTY: Objection.\nYou can answer, if you know.\nTHE WITNESS: To my knowledge,\nNorfolk Southern has never had to\nperform a vent and burn on any\nincident.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:",
  "Q.   So I guess the answer to my\nquestion would be they've never had to do a\nvent and burn with regard to vinyl chloride\nmonomer before.\nRight?",
  "MR. FUKUMURA: Objection.\nAsked and answered. Foundation.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:\nQ.   You can answer.\nA.   To my knowledge, they have\nnever had to conduct a vent and burn on any\ncar.\nQ.   At the time of the derailment,\nsir, you were the systems manager for\nhazardous materials at Norfolk Southern.\nIs that right?\nA.   That's correct.\nQ.   You had that role since 2019?\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   And before that, am I right you\nwere a hazard -- hazardous compliance officer\nat Norfolk Southern?\nA.   That's correct.\nQ.   From about 2012 to 2019?\nA.   That's correct.\nQ.   Okay. Now if I understand it\ncorrectly, in May of 2023 you received a\npromotion.\nIs that right?\nA.   That's correct.\nQ.   And you're now the director of\nhazardous materials?\nA.   That is correct.\nQ.   And you're responsible for\nemergency response and preparedness.\nIs that right?\nA.   I manage the Norfolk Southern\nemergency response and preparedness program.\nQ.   That was true as of the time of\nthe derailment of Train 32N in East\nPalestine?\nMS. PETTY: Objection.\nTHE WITNESS: That was true.",
  "That was one of my duties at the time.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:\nQ.   Am I correct, sir, you managed\nat that point in time a team of, what is it,\neight regional managers and HAZMAT managers?\nA.   At that time it was a team of\ntwo regional managers, and the rest were\nHAZMAT managers.\nQ.   And you reported to an\nindividual named David Schoendorfer.\nIs that right?\nA.   That is correct.\nQ.   As of that point in time?\nA.   That's correct.\nQ.   He was the director of\nenvironmental for Norfolk Southern.\nIs that correct?\nA.   That is correct.\nQ.   You no longer report to\nMr. Schoendorfer?\nA.   Mr. Schoendorfer has retired.\nQ.   Do you know when he was asked\nto retire -21        MS. PETTY: Objection.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:\nQ.   -- following the derailment of\nTrain 32N, sir?",
  "MS. PETTY: Objection. Lack of\nfoundation. Assumes facts.\nTHE WITNESS: I don't know why\nMr. Schoendorfer retired.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:\nQ.   You weren't aware that he was\nasked to retire?",
  "MS. PETTY: Objection.\nFoundation.\nTHE WITNESS: I was not.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:\nQ.   Did he have some role and\ninvolvement, sir, in East Palestine?",
  "MS. PETTY: Objection. Vague.\nTHE WITNESS: Yes. He was\ninvolved in the response to East\nPalestine. He served as incident\ncommander at one point for Norfolk\nSouthern.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:\nQ.   At what point in time?\nA.   He was -- if I can remember\ncorrectly, he was there, I think, on the 6th,\nand then when he -- when he departed from the\nsite, I can't -- I can't remember.\nQ.   Okay. So from Norfolk\nSouthern's perspective, he was the incident\ncommander from the 6th until the time of his\ndeparture from the scene?\nA.   He was the incident commander\nfor Norfolk Southern for the site starting - 6 it wouldn't have been on the 6th because Dave\nGooden was still the incident command rep for\nNorfolk Southern at the time.\nQ.   All right. Why don't we -10 we'll get into some greater detail on all\nthis as we go, but since we're on it now, who\nwas the incident commander for Norfolk\nSouthern on site on February 3rd, that\nFriday, if anyone?\nA.   Kraig Barner and Dave Gooden\nwere both there, I believe.\nQ.   And who had that role or\nfunction or title, sir?",
  "MS. PETTY: Objection.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:\nQ.   Of incident commander for\nNorfolk Southern.\nA.   For Norfolk Southern, it would\nhave been Kraig Barner when he got there.\nQ.   And was there another incident\ncommander for Norfolk Southern between that\nFriday and Monday when Mr. Schoendorfer\nbecame Norfolk Southern's incident commander\nat the site?\nA.   I don't recall the date\nMr. Schoendorfer took over incident command\nresponsibilities. I don't believe it was the\nth. He was there, but so was Mr. Barner.\nQ.   Okay. And so as best you\nrecall, sir, Mr. Barner, excuse me, was the\nincident commander for Norfolk Southern from\nthe 3rd until a point in time when\nMr. Schoendorfer became the incident\ncommander for Norfolk Southern at the site.\nIs that right?\nA.   At some point in time it would\nhave been himself or Dave Gooden.\nQ.   What's the sequence as you\nremember it, sir, between those three\nindividuals?\nA.   I do not know whether Dave\nGooden or Kraig Barner arrived on the scene\nfirst on the 3rd. Whichever one arrived\nfirst, they would have been the senior\ntransportation officer who would have been\nthe incident commander for Norfolk Southern's\nportion.\nQ.   Okay. And then that person\nwould have stayed in that role until a\ntransition to Mr. Schoendorfer?",
  "MS. PETTY: Objection.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:\nQ.   Just trying to understand, sir.\nA.   There would have been a senior\ntransportation officer serving as incident\ncommander. I believe Dave Gooden would have\nbeen who passed it on to Mr. Schoendorfer. I\nbelieve.\nQ.   Okay. There's been a number of\nfolks who have testified in the last several\nweeks relating -- in the litigation setting,\nsir, relating to this particular derailment.\nYou're aware of that?\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   Have you had communications\nwith any of them about their testimony, sir?\nA.   No.\nQ.   Have you had communications\nwith anyone about your testimony today?",
  "MS. PETTY: Objection.\nYou can answer to the extent it\ndoesn't require you to disclose any\ncommunications with counsel.\nMR.

BUCHANAN:\nQ.   Anybody other than NS counsel,\nsir?\nA.   NS's outside counsel and my\ncounsel.\nQ.   How about folks who were\ninvolved in the aftermath of the derailment 17 Norfolk Southern's response, its contractors,\net cetera?\nMS. PETTY: Objection.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:\nQ.   Have you spoken to any of them?",
  "MS. PETTY: Objection to the\nform.\nTHE WITNESS: Not with regard\nto any deposition.\nWe have day-to-day work that\nwe're still doing on site that I talk\nwith contractors.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:\nQ.   We talked briefly about you\nultimately arrive on scene in East Palestine.\nCorrect, sir?\nA.   I arrived on site Saturday, the\nth.\nQ.   And you're involved, obviously,\nwith a lot of the activities that happen over\nthe period of time after you arrive.\nFair, sir?",

Well, before Norfolk Southern,\nthrough you, recommended to Chief Drabick to\ndo a vent and burn, and you shared the\ninformation that you shared and didn't share\nthe information you didn't share, did you\nconsult with people more broadly within\nNorfolk Southern?\nMR. FUKUMURA: Objection.\nMS. PETTY: Objection.\nTHE WITNESS: All the\ninformation was passed on to my\nsuperiors, yes.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:\nQ.   Okay. And who were your\nsuperiors?\nA.   David Schoendorfer was my\ndirect supervisor, and our department head\nwas Helen Hart.\nQ.   So you're interacting with\nthose folks on this decision and what the Oxy\nVinyls people were saying or not saying?\nMS. PETTY: Objection.\nMR. FUKUMURA: Objection.\nMS. PETTY: Vague.\nTHE WITNESS: I was passing on\nbriefings, yes, to my upper\nmanagement.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:\nQ.   Okay.

Let's go back to\nexhibit -- I believe we're at 3, in that\npage 77.\nWe started to look at this\nbefore the break, sir. We're on this bullet,\nsecond up from the bottom.\nThis is in your 6 p.m. briefing\nto the NTSB where you stated the following,\nThe Norfolk Southern system manager for\nhazardous materials stated the temperature in\none car, as measured with a thermal camera on\nthe tank shell, had risen to 138 degrees\nFahrenheit, whereas 185 is the critical\ntemperature for a runaway polymerization\nreaction, according to Oxy Vinyls.\"\nDo you see that, sir?",

And that's what you told\nthem.\nRight?\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   What you told the NTSB and what\nyou told Chief Drabick, as best you recall?\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   Continues. \"The temperature in\none car had increased by 3 degrees in one\nhour, suggesting that the VCM lading was\nundergoing polymerization.\"\nDo you see that, sir?\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   That's what you told the NTSB",
  "at 6 and what you told Chief Drabick an hour\nbefore.\nRight?\nA.   Yes. There was a 3-degree\nincrease in temperature outside the presence\nof a pool fire for hours.\nQ.   That's right.\nSo you told them that the\ntemperature change that you note here\nsuggested that the VCM lading was undergoing\npolymerization. That's what you reported.\nRight?",
  "MS. PETTY: Objection.\nTHE WITNESS: That is what we\nbelieved.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:\nQ.   And that's what you reported.\nCorrect?\nMS. PETTY: Objection.\nTHE WITNESS: Yes.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:\nQ.   It continues. \"If the vent and\nburn is not conducted, the likely outcome\nwill be a violent explosion with tank car\nfragments traveling as much as half a mile\nfrom the site.\"\nThat's what you told Chief\nDrabick?\nA.   To the best of my knowledge,\nyes.",
  "Q.   And the NTSB?\nA.   If that's stated in the report,\nthen, yes.\nQ.   And as best you recall, that's\nwhat your contractors told the unified\ncommand at the meeting you had to leave\nearlier from.\nCorrect?",

BUCHANAN:\nQ.   The company started monitoring\ntemperatures this Sunday afternoon.\nRight?\nMR. FUKUMURA: Objection.\nAsked and answered.\nTHE WITNESS: Our emergency\nresponse contractors, as part of\ndamage assessment, was conducting\nsampling of temperatures.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:\nQ.   Too many documents here, sir.\nLet me find one.\nAnd you're monitoring\ntemperatures, sir, because the Oxy Vinyls\nfolks had said if you want to know whether\nthere's a polymerization reaction going on,\nmonitor the temperatures?\nA.   No.",

  "MS. PETTY: Objection.\nTHE WITNESS: The only\ninformation passed to me was that Oxy\nbelieved the product wasn't\npolymerizing.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:",
  "Q.   Okay. So nobody shared with\nyou that they had said if you had that\nconcern, monitor temperatures. That was not\nshared with you.\nCorrect?\nA.   No one from Oxy shared anything\ndirectly with me.\nQ.   I see.\nBut your team didn't relate\nthat to you either.\nCorrect?\nA.   I don't recall any discussion\nof it, but heat production during\npolymerization is a known.\nWood Exhibit 7 marked for\nidentification.)\nQUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:\nQ.   Okay. Here you are, sir.\nWe're up to Exhibit 7 in your deposition.\nThis is a Group D, Exhibit 9,\nentitled \"NS E-mail Explanation of Tank Car\nTemperature Measurements Readings April 13,\nHave you seen this before, sir?\nA.   I don't recall the handwritten\nnotes. The spreadsheet I'm familiar with.\nQ.   Okay. Let's look at the\ndocument at .2. It's an e-mail forwarding a\nnarrative.\nI realize you didn't draft the\ne-mail, sir, but I just want to see how this\nsyncs up with your recollection.\nIn the middle it says, \"Around\np.m. on February 5, Norfolk Southern's\nemergency response contractors, SPSI, were\nable to enter the site and begin taking\ntemperature readings of the vinyl chloride\ncars.\"\nDo you see that?\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   \"SPSI's temperature readings\nwere taken with a hand-held temperature gauge\nwhich displays a digital reading on the\ntemperature gauge itself but does not have\nhistorical readings. On the night of\nFebruary 5th, SPSI's temperature readings\nwere relayed by phone or text by SPSI to\nRobert Wood or Jon Simpson, who then entered\nthose readings onto a spreadsheet for\ntracking purposes.\"\nDo you see that, sir?\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   Does that refresh your\nrecollection, sir, as to whether or not you\nwere tracking the temperatures in the vinyl\nchloride cars?",
  "MS. PETTY: Objection.\nMR. FUKUMURA: Objection.\nTHE WITNESS: There was no\nquestion about I was tracking the\ntemperatures.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:\nQ.   And you specifically, sir, were\ntracking the vinyl chloride temperatures on a\nspreadsheet.\nCorrect, sir?\nMS. PETTY: Objection.\nTHE WITNESS: Yes.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:\nQ.   Okay. You were entering\nthose readings that you were getting relayed\nto you from SPSI into a spreadsheet.\nCorrect?\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   I take it you would agree, sir,\nit would be important to collect and monitor\nand report on data accurately?",
  "MS. PETTY: Objection.\nTHE WITNESS: Yes.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:\nQ.   I mean, you had been told that\nthis polymerization reaction was a highly\nexothermic reaction.\nRight?\nA.   I had not been given any -15 temperature rise during polymerization is a\nknown.\nQ.   Okay. I mean, escalating\ntemperatures would be an indication that\nthere may be a concern that you needed to act\non.\nFair?\nMS. PETTY: Objection.",
  "THE WITNESS: Yes.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:\nQ.   And that's one of the reasons\nyou were monitoring temperatures.\nRight?\nMS. PETTY: Objection.\nTHE WITNESS: Yes, because\nrailcars had been exposed to pool\nfires.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:\nQ.   Could I have P106?\nMR. FUKUMURA: He's done with\nit.\nMR.

Passing you, sir, what\nwe're marking as Exhibit 8 to your\ndeposition.\nHave you seen this, sir?\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   You recall when you gave\ntestimony before the NTSB in June, you were\npresented with a chart of your temperature",

Sir, we're back on\nExhibit 8.\nDo you have that before you?\nThat's that chart that you said you saw at\nthe NTSB hearing.\nRight?\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   Okay. Presented to you by some\nNTSB representatives.\nFair?\nA.   It was part of the documents,\nyes.\nQ.   Yeah.\nIt reflects a decision to vent\nand burn right around that five, six o'clock\ntimeline.\nDo you see that? 4? 5? Do\nyou see that?\nMS.

And this is that car OCPX80370\nthat was one of the vinyl chloride cars.\nRight?\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   And the overnight -- you were\nworking the overnight shift.\nIs that right?\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   And as you were monitoring\ntemperatures on that car after the decision\nhad been made to vent and burn because of\nescalating temperatures, temperatures\nactually declined.\nRight?\nMS. PETTY: Objection.\nTHE WITNESS: There had been no\ndecision to vent and burn.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:\nQ.   I'm sorry, sir.\nHadn't there been a decision\nmade as of Sunday afternoon to conduct a vent\nand burn?\nA.   There was a belief that Norfolk\nSouthern believed that that was the safest\nmeans - 6    Q.   Okay.\nA.   -- but the ultimate decision is\nthe incident commander's.\nQ.   Oh, I see.\nSo you're saying that you get\nto bring some of the information but not all\nof the information to Chief Drabick, and it's\non him if it was the wrong decision?",
  "MS. PETTY: Objection.\nMR. FUKUMURA: Objection.\nArgumentative. Foundation.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:\nQ.   Is that what you're saying?\nA.   No.\nQ.   Oh. Right.\nBecause he should have had all\nthe information that you had about whether it\nwas polymerizing or not polymerizing.\nRight?",

But when you went to the\nNTSB that night at 6 p.m., you said the\nincrease in temperature by 3 degrees was an\nindication that it was undergoing\npolymerization.\nIsn't that what you told the\nNTSB?\nMS. PETTY: Objection.\nTHE WITNESS: Yes. That's what\nwe believed.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. BUCHANAN:\nQ.   Okay. And the contrary is not\ntrue, sir, when the temperature is declining,\nthat it's not undergoing polymerization?\nMS. PETTY: Objection.\nMR.

You previously identified this\nas your interview transcript in front of the\nNTSB that was taken on February 8, 2023.\nCorrect?\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   Let's turn to page 23 of that\ntranscript.\nA.   Page 23 or dot.\nCHRIS RITONA: PDF page or - 2        MS. BROZ: The actual page of\nthe transcript in the top right-hand\ncorner.\nCHRIS RITONA: So we're off by\none.\nMS. BROZ: .24, page 23. Thank\nyou.\nQUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:\nQ.   Do you have that in front of\nyou?\nA.   I'm looking for what?\nQ.   Page 23. The actual page\nnumber of the document.\nA.   Page 23?\nQ.   Yes.\nA.   Yes, I'm sorry. I had to peel\nit back to see the page number.\nQ.   Do you see where it says line\nnumbers on the left-hand side of the page?\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   Can you go to line 5, please?\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   And tell me if I read this\ncorrectly. And it says, \"And that car was\nalso oriented a little different, too. So it\nwas in a liquid phase to begin with, which is\nmore than likely made the fire worse under - 4 when it was just jetting, it was throwing\nliquid out.\"\nDo you see that testimony?\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   And which car were you\nreferring to when you were talking about the\ncar being in the liquid phase?\nMR. FUKUMURA: You can look at\nthe preceding page as well.\nTHE WITNESS: Yeah, that's what\nI'm looking at.\nYes, it would have been the car\nof the greatest concern.\nQUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:\nQ.   So would that be OCPX80370?\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   And what is the basis for your\nunderstanding that car OCPX80370 was,\nquote/unquote, in the liquid phase?\nA.   The orientation of the car and\nthe position of the valves on the car,\nspecifically the PRD.\nThe car is standing upright.\nThe pipe at the base of the PRD is in the\nvapor space. The car gets turned to its\nside, it's in the liquid phase of the car.\nQ.   So you are not saying in this\ntestimony that somehow the car was leaking\nliquid from it?\nA.   It would have been discharging\nliquid out that PRD.\nQ.   And what is your basis for your\nunderstanding that it was discharging liquid\nfrom out the PRD?\nA.   The position of the PRD.\nQ.   Anything else other than the\nposition of the PRD?\nA.   No.\nQ.   Did you see it discharging\nliquid from the PRD?\nA.   No. Just there was fire.\nQ.   Did anybody report to you that\nit was discharging liquid from the PRD?\nA.   No.\nQ.   So you assume that it was\ndischarging liquid from the PRD solely based\nupon the orientation of the tank car?\nA.   Yes. The base of the PRD would\nhave been in the liquid.\nQ.   That wasn't my question.\nWere you assuming that it was\ndischarging liquid because of the orientation\nof the tank car?\nA.   Yes.\nMR. FUKUMURA: Objection.\nTHE WITNESS: Yes.\nQUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:\nQ.   Let's go to line 11 on that\npage.\nVIDEOGRAPHER: We may need to\ngo off the record.\nMS. BROZ: Okay.

Let's go to\nline 21 of that page.\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   In answer to the question, \"And\nwhat does that do to the pressure relief\ndevice?\" you answered, \"It will operate, but\nit doesn't relieve pressure as fast because\nit's pushing liquid.\"\nDo you see that?\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   Was OCPX80370 in fact pushing\nliquid?\nA.   My belief is yes.\nQ.   Based upon what?\nA.   The position of the PRD.\nQ.   Any other basis to conclude\nthat OCPX80370 was pushing liquid?\nA.   No.\nQ.   Do you have any video evidence\nshowing OCPX80370 pushing liquid out of the\nPRD?\nA.   Just the video of fire coming\nfrom the PRD.\nQ.   Fire and nothing else?\nA.   That's it.\nQ.   Do you have any pictures of it\npushing liquid out of the pressure relief\ndevice?\nA.   I see fire from the PRD.\nQ.   Just fire?\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   Nothing else?\nA.   Correct.\nQ.   You never saw liquid?\nA.   Fire.\nQ.   Just fire?\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   Okay. Let's go to line 24.\nSo you say, \"So it's pushing\nthat monomer that wants to polymerize when it\ngets some oxygen out through the ports.\"\nDo you see that?\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   What is your basis that the\nminute the stabilized vinyl chloride that was\nin OCPX80370 went through the port that it\nwould automatically polymerize?\nMS. PETTY: Objection.\nTHE WITNESS: The polymer\nexiting the PRD. Or, excuse me, the\nmonomer exiting the PRD.\nQUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:\nQ.   So it's your opinion that once\nmonomer exits from a PRD and reacts with\noxygen, it will automatically polymerize?\nMS. PETTY: Objection.\nTHE WITNESS: It's my\nunderstanding it can.\nQUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:\nQ.   Was the monomer that allegedly\nwas exiting from OCPX80370 polymerizing once\nit met with oxygen outside the vinyl chloride\ntank car?\nMS. PETTY: Objection.\nTHE WITNESS: I do not know.\nQUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:\nQ.   Did you find any polymer -- let\nme strike that.\nDid you find any polymerized\nvinyl chloride outside of OCPX80370 when you\nhad an opportunity to inspect the tank cars?\nA.   I did not inspect the tank\ncars.\nQ.   How about when your responders\ninspected the tank cars? Did they find any\npolymerized vinyl chloride outside of\nOCPX80370?\nA.   No, just evidence of fire.\nQ.   Do you have any evidence -- or\nlet me strike that.\nBased upon your knowledge, were\nthe PRDs activating properly in the five tank\ncars containing vinyl chloride?\nMR. FUKUMURA: Objection.\nMS. PETTY: Objection.\nTHE WITNESS: The PR -- the\nPRDs on the five vinyl chloride cars\ndid operate.\nQUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:\nQ.   You can set that aside.\nMR. FUKUMURA: You can set that\nexhibit aside.\nWood Exhibit 18 marked for\nidentification.)\nQUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:\nQ.   We're going to mark a new\nexhibit, Mr. Wood.\nAll right. Mr. Wood, I hand\nyou what we've marked as Deposition\nExhibit 18 and ask you if you recognize this.\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   What is it?\nA.   It's an incident status report.\nQ.   Is this also known as a form\nA.   No.\nQ.   It is not?\nA.   No.\nQ.   What is a form 201?",
  "A.   Form 201 is a NIMS ICS briefing\nform.\nQ.   And were form 201s being\ncompleted between February 3rd and\nFebruary 6th of 2023, following the tank\ncar -- the train derailment in East\nPalestine?\nA.   I believe unified command was.\nThat would have been one of their functions.\nQ.   So these were internal -- these\nincidence status reports were internal\nNorfolk Southern forms?\nA.   This is a Norfolk Southern\nform, but it was shared outside of Norfolk\nSouthern.\nQ.   And what was the purpose of\npreparing and completing the incident status\nreports?\nA.   To provide an incident update\nto NS personnel as well as any regulatory",
  "agency that wanted it.\nQ.   And who prepared these incident\nstatus reports for Norfolk Southern?\nA.   It would have been one of the\nHAZMAT managers on - 9    Q.   Do you know who?\nA.   I was responsible for some of\nthem. Jon Simpson would have done some of\nthem. Probably most of them were done by Jon\nSimpson, I think.\nQ.   Do you know which ones you\nprepared as compared to which ones\nMr. Simpson prepared?\nA.   I do not recall.\nQ.   If you look at the top of -19 I'm going to go by Bates numbers -- NS-CA,\nand the last three digits are 572.\nDo you see at the bottom corner\nthere?\nA.   Uh-huh.\nQ.   Okay.

PETTY: Objection.\nTHE WITNESS: I'm not sure.\nQUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:\nQ.   Okay. Why don't you tell me\nhow you calculate operational periods.\nA.   It varies by incidents.\nQ.   All right. How about for this\nincident?\nA.   I believe these were being done\ntwice a day, I think, at shift change. I\nthink. Some incidents they're done just\nevery morning. It depends.\nQ.   And when was shift change?\nA.   Generally 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.\np.m. to 6 a.m.\nQ.   Do you know why this one is\nlabeled 7 p.m. to 7 a.m.?\nA.   That's generally when\noperational periods are, and you have an\noverlap in personnel.\nQ.   So at the end of an operational\nperiod, you'll complete an incident status\nreport?\nA.   Correct. Someone will.\nQ.   And you will do that every\nhours?\nA.   On some incidents.\nQ.   How about this incident?\nA.   I believe so. At least for a\nperiod of time.\nQ.   You believe that one was\ncreated every 12 hours?\nA.   I believe.\nQ.   Do you know whether you\nprepared what we've marked as Deposition\nExhibit 18?\nA.   I do not.\nQ.   Is there a way of telling who\nprepared this form?\nA.   I don't think so.\nQ.   Where do you go -- let me start\nthat again.\nIs there a computer system that\nyou go to to complete these forms at the end\nof a shift change?\nA.   This is just a Word document.\nQ.

  "Q.   Do you see the 3.1.1 paragraph?\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   In the third line down, it\nrepeats the language that the vinyl chloride\nwas sitting in situ.\nCorrect?\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   And then you see that last\nsentence there?\nIt starts with \"The release of\nvinyl chloride resulted from the functioning\nof pressure relief devices and from the\nsubsequent intentional vent and burn\nactions.\"\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   Do you agree with the\nstatements in this paragraph?\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   And you agree with the\nstatements that were contained in your report\nthat we previously marked as Deposition\nExhibit 18, that the vinyl chloride was in",
  "situ?\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   Earlier today, I believe you\ntestified that vinyl chloride was being\nreleased from the other valves of the vinyl\nchloride cars?\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   And what is your basis for that\nunderstanding?\nA.   Visible burning from around the\nvalves.\nQ.   So we're back to the fire\nagain?\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   Any other reason to conclude\nthat liquid vinyl chloride was leaking from\nany of the valves contained on the tank cars?\nA.   It's reasonable to conclude\nthat that's vinyl chloride burning.\nQ.   I understand you're concluding\nit's vinyl chloride, but what is your basis\nto conclude that liquid vinyl chloride was\nreleased -- was leaking from the valves in\nthe tank cars?\nA.   I said vinyl chloride was.\nQ.   But not liquid?\nA.   I don't know.\nQ.   So you're changing your\ntestimony from earlier today where you\ntestified that liquid vinyl chloride was\nleaking from the valves in the tank cars?",
  "MS. PETTY: Objection.\nMR. FUKUMURA: Objection.\nTHE WITNESS: No.\nWhat was stated in the record\nhere and otherwise is we believed it\nwas liquid vinyl chloride burning out\nof the PRD due to the position of it.\nThe possibility exists,\ndepending on where the fire is coming\nfrom the valves, it could be liquid,\nit could be vapors. We don't know.\nQUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:\nQ.   I think let's go a step back.\nWhat is your basis for\nunderstanding that vinyl chloride, liquid or\notherwise, was releasing from anything other\nthan the PRDs?\nA.   The visible fires burning.\nQ.   Is it possible that the fires\nwere burning as a result of reacting with\nsome other chemical other than vinyl\nchloride?\nMS.

The first instance of a -13 dealing with an angle valve is on .66.\nQ.   And on .66, does it say\nanything about that valve leaking vinyl\nchloride after the derailment?\nA.   It says, \"The teardown of the\nangle valve, the Midland manufacturing model\nA720-0X-CVGFS, Serial Number GE-022-RA, found\nthe valve stem seal was heat-damaged and\nmissing and the gasket was heat-damaged.\"\nQ.   And did you find anything in\nwhat we've marked as Deposition Exhibit 3\nstating that the valve, in fact, was leaking?\nA.   Just that the valve gasket was\nno longer there.\nQ.

You were asked some questions,\nand you gave some testimony about VCM that\nwas released from the cars via a valve other\nthan the PRD.\nDo you remember that testimony?\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   Did you reach that conclusion\nwith respect to GATX95098?\nA.   I don't have specifics to which\ncars.

Yes.\nQ.   Okay. And that decision tree\nwas a decision tree that you undertake when\nthere's a derailment.\nIs that correct?\nMS. PETTY: Objection.\nTHE WITNESS: Yes, specific to\ntank cars.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. ELLIS:\nQ.   Okay.
