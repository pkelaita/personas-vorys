I had a conversation with 2 Dianne Barnett, who is in our mechanical 3 department, because I had a question about 4 one of the hot box detector alerts. 5 And another hot box detector 6 alert that appeared when I read the documents 7 appeared to say the same thing. 8 Q. Uh-huh. 9 A. So I did ask what the 10 difference between those two alerts were. 11 Q. Okay. Did you talk to any 12 other Norfolk Southern employee to gather 13 information or facts or explanations for 14 preparation for this deposition? 15 A. In reviewing the 2020 emergency 16 response guide, I did not know if that was 17 the latest, the greatest, and I did not know 18 if that was -- again, if it wasn't the 19 latest, I wanted to make sure we were looking 20 at the right emergency response guide. 21 So I spoke with Robert Wood at 22 Norfolk Southern, who confirmed that it was 23 the latest issue from PHMSA, the Department 24 of Transportation. 25 Q. Okay. And what is Robert|\nWood's position with Norfolk Southern?\nA.   He works in our HAZMAT area.\nQ.   Hazardous materials?\nA.   Hazardous materials.\nQ.   Okay.

I'm involved with resource\ns t a f f i n g .\nLike the one that derailed in\nEast Palestine on February 3, 2023, that's a\nthrough-freight train. Have you ever\noperated one of those as a conductor or\nworked on one as a conductor?\nA.   No, not as a conductor.\nQ.   Okay. Did you talk to the\nlawyers, meet with the lawyers, to prepare?\nI don't want to know what you\ntalked about, but you can tell me how many\ntimes did you meet with lawyers and how long\ndid you spend preparing for your deposition.\nDon't tell me what you talked about. Just\ntell me time.\nMS. PUJARI: Objection to the\nextent it calls for privileged\ninformation.\nYou can answer, but not as to\nany content.\nTHE WITNESS: I believe we met\non four occasions, and I believe the\nlongest of those four was up to four\nhours.

Yes, sir.\nQ.   Okay. And if we go to page 2\nof that document, it refers to various\nallegations that were made in a lawsuit that\nNorfolk Southern filed against third parties\nand -- in this derailment case, the East\nPalestine derailment case, and references\ncertain paragraphs in that pleading that the\nrailroad filed.\nC o r r e c t ?\nA.   Yes, it appears to do just\nt h a t .\nQ.   Okay. And it looks like your\nExhibit 1, this document where you talked\nabout all that, it looks like the lawyers or\nsomebody -- strike that.\nIt looks like somebody took\nthose paragraphs and provided those for you\nfrom the notice.\nC o r r e c t ?\nA.

So and 2 you're ready to talk about these today on 3 behalf of both corporations, both Norfolk 4 Southern corporations? 5 A. Correct. 6 (Dixon 30(b)(6) Exhibit 4 7 marked for identification.) 8 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 9 Q. Okay. Let's start with the 10 very first paragraph. Let's pull up the 11 third-party complaint, please. We'll mark 12 that as 4. 13 And let's go to paragraph 29 on 14 page 8 of the third-party complaint. It's 15 the very first paragraph that's in the 16 notice, and it's in the document that was 17 provided for you to be prepared for. 18 Do you see that? Very first 19 o n e . 20 A. Can you repeat what page? 21 Q. I've got page 8 of the 22 third-party complaint. 23 A. Okay. 24 Q. And I think paragraph 29 is 25 right at the top, and I think I highlighted|Page 25 1 Right? 2 A. That's correct. 3 Q. Okay. You still have that, 4 don't you, in front of you, Exhibit 1? 5 A. I do. 6 Q. You mentioned the NTSB docket 7 Group B, Exhibit 5; the ALS TRRA 31 consist; 8 NTSB docket Group B, Exhibit 6 and 10; 9 hearing transcript day 1 at page 27; and the 10 air brake inspection and test certificate 11 from TRRA. 12 And TRRA is the Terminal 13 Railroad Association St. Louis. 14 C o r r e c t ? 15 A. That's correct. 16 Q. And do you know anything about 17 that railroad? 18 A. Not a lot, no. 19 Q. What little do you know about 20 t h e m ? 21 A. I know it's a terminal 22 switching rail service. 23 Q. Okay. So they're in the 24 St. Louis area. They do local switching, 25 interchange with big carriers like NS, right?|\nA.   That's correct.\nQ.   Okay. I think they're a\nClass III railroad, aren't they?\nA.   I'm not positive on that.\nQ.   Okay. Certainly not a Class I\nr a i l r o a d ?\nA.   That's correct.\nQ.   Okay. All right. So when we\ntalk about a, quote -- can we underline that,\nMichael? -- quote, \"qualified mechanical\ninspector\" paragraph?  Yeah.\nThat means something under the\nFRA regulations, doesn't it, sir?\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   Okay. And that regulation is\ngoverned by 49 CFR 215, right?\nA.   Correct.\nDixon 30(b)(6) Exhibit 5\nmarked for identification.)\nQUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:\nQ.   Can we pull that up, please?\nBecause I don't see that on your list here of\nwhat you reviewed, and I just want to make\nsure we get through this correctly.\nAre we on Exhibit 4, Carrie?\nwith -- well, read the title. \"Designated\ni n s p e c t o r . \"\nThat's what you're -- what is\nbeing referred to in paragraph 29 of this\nthird-party complaint, is this is the\nqualified mechanical inspector, correct?\nThis defines what they are?",
  "MS. PUJARI: Objection as to\nthe document stating \"designated\ninspector.\" It's in the complaint\nstating \"qualified inspector.\"\nMisstates the document.",
  "MR. DENTON: Okay.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:\nQ.

Well, you're here on behalf of\nthe Norfolk Southern Railway speaking for the\nc o r p o r a t i o n .\nAre you telling me the\ncorporation doesn't know the answer to that\nq u e s t i o n ?\nPage 27 1 5 . 2 Have you -- you've looked at 3 this in the past, haven't you, sir, Part 215 4 of the Railroad Freight Car Safety Standards? 5 A. I'm not familiar with the whole 6 Part 215. 7 Q. Okay. But you do understand 8 it's the regulations that govern freight car 9 safety standards? 10 A. It's part of the regulations. 11 Q. Right. Okay. 12 But when we talk about a 13 certified mechanical -- or qualified 14 mechanical inspector, that's defined in these 15 regulations, isn't it, sir? 16 A. Yes, sir. 17 Q. Let's go to -- I think it's 18 actually right there, 215.11, Designated 19 in s p e c t o r s . 20 Are you following me, sir? 21 A. I'm not there yet. 22 Q. Okay. Are you with me now? 23 A. I am. 24 Q. Okay. And this is the 25 section -- and if we read it, starting|Page 29 1 A. I know that the FRA, who is 2 responsible for governance of railcar 3 operations, mechanical activities, as stated, 4 if we look at the NTB investigative hearing 5 transcript, day 1 -- 6 Q. Yeah. 7 A. -- page 7 -- 8 Q. Right. 9 A. -- that the cars were inspected 10 by -- at the TRA -- TRRA by a mechanical 11 qualified inspector. 12 Q. Well, I'm going to test you on 13 that, sir, because I don't believe that to be 14 the case. That's what we're here for today. 15 Okay? Are you ready to go? 16 A. Sure. 17 Q. Okay. Because you're not here 18 to testify on behalf of the NTSB. You're 19 here to testify on behalf of Norfolk Southern 20 Railway Company, the knowledge of the 21 railroad, correct? 22 A. Correct. 23 Q. Okay. So let's look at what 24 the regulations defined as a qualified -- or 25 a designated, quote -- sorry, designated|\ni n s p e c t o r .\nA, each railroad that operates\na railroad freight car to which this part\napplies shall designate persons qualified to\ninspect railroad freight cars for compliance\nwith this part to make the determinations\nrequired by 215.9 of this part.\"\nRight?  Follow me?\nA.   That's what it states.\nQ.   Okay. It goes down -- it goes\non in B. \"Each person designated under this",
  "section shall have demonstrated to the\nrailroad a knowledge and ability to inspect\nthe railroad freight cars for compliance with\nthe requirements of this part and to make the\ndeterminations required by 215.9.\"\nC o r r e c t ?\nA.   Correct.\nQ.   Okay. Let's look at all the\nthings that a qualified inspector under 215\nis supposed to look at.\nLet's go to the next set.\nLet's go to Section 215.103.\nAre you with me?\nA.   215.103.\nBut you have to -- that's part\nof what the inspection is required by the\nqualified mechanical inspection, right?\nA.   According to 215.105, yes.\nQ.   Okay. Let's go to 215.107,\nDefective plain bearing box: General.\"\nWhat is a plain bearing box?\nA.   Give me a second to read what\nthey stated here.\nI believe they're referring to\nthe housing of the bearing.\nQ.   Right.\nAnd one of the things is to\nmake sure it's visible, free of oil, right?\nUnder A?\nA.   Yes, free of oil.\nQ.   And we'll skip 215.09 just to\nmove on to 215.111, \"Defective plain\nb e a r i n g . \"\nDo you know what a plain\nbearing is?\nA.   I assume it's just a bearing.\nQ.   Just a bearing.\nOkay. Let's go down to\nDefective roller bearing.\"\nPage 31 1 Q. Right. 2 \"Defective wheels.\" 3 C o r r e c t ? 4 A. Correct. 5 Q. It lists a lot of information 6 as to what the inspector is supposed to look 7 for on each railcar. Talks about wheel 8 flanges in paragraph A. Talks about wheel 9 flanges in paragraph B, thickness of the rim, 10 et cetera, a lot of information. Whether the 11 wheel is loose, down in paragraph G, whether 12 there's oil leaking from the wheels. 13 Do you see that? 14 A. I do. 15 Q. All right. In addition to that 16 in 215.105, a qualified inspection requires 17 that you look for defective axles. 18 R ig h t ? 19 A. Correct. 20 Q. What is an axle, sir; do you 21 k n o w ? 22 A. The axle attaches the two rail 23 wheels. It comes as a wheel set. 24 Q. Okay. We've got pictures of 25 that. We'll look at that later.|Page 33 1 Okay. That's what caused the 2 derailment here in East Palestine, was a 3 defective roller bearing, correct? 4 A. I don't believe that the actual 5 investigation has been finalized at this 6 point, so -- 7 Q. What is the position of the 8 Norfolk Southern Railway Company, sir? Did 9 or did not a defective roller bearing cause 10 this derailment? 11 A. I believe that we're in support 12 of the investigation to determine the cause. 13 Q. We're nine months out. 14 Are you telling me that Norfolk 15 Southern Railway Company doesn't know that a 16 defective roller bearing caused this 17 d e r a i lm e n t ? 18 A. I would assume that the -- that 19 the company would assume that the roller 20 bearing, the defective roller bearing, 21 resulted in the derailment of Car 23. 22 Q. Okay. Thank you. 23 And then back to 215.115. 24 That's one of the many things that a 25 qualified inspection is supposed to review,|\nand let's go through it.\nPart A, \"A railroad may not\nplace or continue in service a car that has a\nroller bearing that shows signs of being\noverheated as evidenced by: discoloration.\"\nRight?\nA.   Right.\nQ.   \"Or telltale signs of\noverheating, such as damage to the seal or\ndistortion of any bearing component.\"\nRight?\nMS. PUJARI: Counsel, I'm going\nto object to the characterization of\nthe document as requiring an\ninspection under this section as\nopposed to a prohibition on placing\nthis component into service.\nMR.

I'm not.\nQ.   \"A railroad may not place or\nA.   I do.\nQ.   All right. And if we go back\nto 215.15, one of the sections under that\npart is that a railroad may not place or\ncontinue in service if the car has a roller\nbearing that shows signs of being overheated,\net cetera.\nC o r r e c t ?\nMS. PUJARI: Counsel, which -10        MR. DENTON:  215.115.\nTHE WITNESS:  Correct.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:\nQ.   Okay. So let's go back to\nparagraph 29, and let's talk about whether\nNorfolk Southern performed this inspection of\nthe railcars and train in Madison, Illinois.\nOkay? You with me?\nA.   I'm with you.\nQ.   Okay. Norfolk Southern\nRailway, or none of its employees, inspected\nthis train, did they?\nA.   At Madison?\nQ.   Yes.\nA.   The TRRA inspected the train.\nQ.   So answer my question.\nPage 35 1 continue in service if the car has a plain 2 bearing that is cracked, missing,\" et cetera. 3 Oh, we went to the wrong 4 section. Strike all that. Sorry. It's 5 215.11, not 111. That's my fault. 6 MS. PUJARI: Thank you. 7 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 8 Q. Just to be clear, I'm at 9 215.11, sir. 10 Have you got it in front of 11 y o u ? 12 A. I do. 13 Q. All right. It says, \"Each 14 railroad that operates a freight car\" -- 15 Certainly that applies to NS, 16 r ig h t ? 17 And this is a railroad that is 18 putting a freight car in trains, right? 19 R ig h t ? 20 A. We're operating -- yes. 21 Q. -- \"shall designate persons 22 qualified to inspect the freight cars for 23 compliance with this part and to make the 24 determinations required by this part.\" 25 See that?|Page 37 1 No one employed by Norfolk 2 Southern did a mechanical inspection of this 3 t r a in . 4 C o r r e c t ? 5 A. Correct. 6 MS. PUJARI: Object. 7 Objection. Vague as to which train. 8 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 9 Q. N32 that derailed in East 10 Palestine, Ohio, on February 3, 2023, left 11 Madison, Illinois, February 1, 2023. 12 Correct? 13 MS. PUJARI: Could you restate 14 the question? 15 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 16 Q. Did any Norfolk Southern 17 employee do a mechanical inspection of 18 Train 32N on February 1, 2023, in Madison, 19 I l l in o is ? 20 A. No. 21 Q. Did any Norfolk Southern 22 employee do a mechanical inspection of 23 Train 32N from Madison, Illinois, to the time 24 it derailed in East Palestine at 8:56 on 25 February 3, 2023?|\nA.   The train was inspected -- or\nthe cars that were added to the train at\nDecatur, Illinois, were -- those cars were\ninspected by a Norfolk Southern qualified\nmechanical employee.\nQ.   That was an air brake test,\nwasn't it?\nA.   It was a mechanical inspection\non an air brake.\nQ.   But Car Number 23, the\ndefective wheel bearing car, GATX car, was in\nthe first part of that train, right?\nMS. PUJARI: Objection. Vague.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:\nQ.   You've seen the consist?\nMS. PUJARI: Objection.\nCould you restate the question,\nplease?\nQUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:\nQ.   Let me just -- this is not\nhard, sir.\nThe GPLX75465 that caused this\nderailment left Madison, Illinois, on\nFebruary 1, 2023, in a Norfolk Southern\ntrain, right?\nTHE WITNESS:  That's true.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:\nQ.   Now, I want to understand what\nyou claim the Terminal Railroad Association\ndid in Madison, Illinois, with respect to\nthis railcar.\nWas there an inspection by that\nr a i l r o a d ?\nA.   The TRRA did perform a\nmechanical inspection and brake test.\nQ.   Have you seen a single document\nthat would verify that the Terminal Railroad\nof St. Louis did a mechanical inspection on\nthis car?\nA.   The only thing that I have seen\nwas both the mechanical factual report and\nthe NTSB hearing information supplied by the\nFRA and the Norfolk -- or the National\nTransportation Safety Board that states\nduring their hearing that the NTSB\ninvestigated the car inspections for those\ncars and that a mechanical -- a qualified\nmechanical employee inspected those cars and\nperformed a Class I brake test at the TRRA.\nQ.   I understand that. There's two\nPage 39 1 A. That's correct. 2 Q. That's the train that derailed, 3 and that's the car that caused the derailment 4 in East Palestine on February 3, 2023. 5 Correct? 6 A. Again, that's a -- that's what 7 we believe to have caused the derailment, 8 but, again, I do not believe the 9 investigation has been completed. 10 Q. I don't care about the 11 investigation. I care about the knowledge of 12 Norfolk Southern. 13 A. And our knowledge is, again, we 14 believe that car to be the cause; however, 15 the investigation is not complete. 16 Q. Okay. And my question is this, 17 from the time that car left Madison, 18 Illinois, on February 1st, the defective car, 19 GPLX75465, the hopper car, Number 23, from 20 the time it left Madison, Illinois, until the 21 time of the derailment, not a single Norfolk 22 Southern inspector inspected that particular 23 c a r . 24 T r u e ? 25 MS. KARIS: Object to form.|Page 41 1 different tests; there's a mechanical test 2 and an air brake test. 3 Two completely different tests, 4 right, sir? 5 A. Yes, I would consider those -- 6 the mechanical inspection and the Class I 7 test as two separate tests, yes. 8 Q. Okay. Have you seen a single 9 piece of paper generated by the Terminal 10 Railroad Association that they performed a 11 qualified mechanical inspection on this 12 defective railcar? 13 MS. KARIS: Object to form. 14 THE WITNESS: No, I've not seen 15 any documentation on each one of the 16 cars that were inspected from the 17 T R R A . 18 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 19 Q. Let me ask a different 20 q u e s t io n . 21 Do you have any documentation 22 the Terminal Railroad inspected any part of 23 Train 32N from a mechanical -- qualified 24 mechanical inspection? 25 A. I think my response is the same|\nas the last question. I do not have any\ndocumentation from the TRRA outside of the\nClass I brake slip.\nQ.   Okay.\nA.   That I've seen.\nDixon 30(b)(6) Exhibit 6\nmarked for identification.)\nQUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:\nQ.   All right. Let's -- yeah. No.\nNo. Let's call up -- let's call up\nthis e-mail. It's\nN S - C A - 0 0 1 3 9 7 0 4 9 .\nHave you seen this document\nbefore, sir?\nA.   What exhibit is this? Is this\nExhibit 6?\nQ.   No. Down at the bottom you'll\nsee a number. It's NS-CA, and the last three\ndigits are 049.\nDo you see that?\nA.   I do.\nQ.   Okay. That's the correct\ndocument. It's actually a two-page -- it's\nan e-mail string. If you go to the second\npage, which ends in 50, that's the beginning\nr i g h t ?\nA.   Correct.\nQ.   All right. And so who is\nRandall Hunt at NS?\nA.   He's the senior director of\nrail line services at Norfolk Southern.\nQ.   Okay. He's at corporate\nheadquarters in Atlanta?\nA.   Yes, sir.\nQ.   So we've got, it looks like,\nthat Norfolk Southern corporate headquarters\nreached out to the general manager of the\nTerminal Railroad after the derailment to get\ninformation about this railcar.\nCorrect?\nMS. PUJARI: Objection.\nMisstates the document.\nTHE WITNESS: Yeah, I don't -19    I don't believe this indicates that\nNorfolk Southern reached out -21 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:\nQ.   Okay. Well, we at least know\nthat the general manager of the Terminal\nRailroad Association sent an e-mail to\nRandall Hunt, subject GPLX75465, on\nPage 43 1 of the string. 2 When you prepared for your 3 deposition here today, sir, did you see this 4 document? 5 A. No, I did not. 6 Q. Okay. Well, let's go through 7 it. I'll go through it with you. 8 We start on page 2, which is 9 the Bates number 50. 10 You can see at the bottom, Adam 11 Mahlandt, general manager, Terminal Railroad 12 Association of St. Louis. The date of the 13 e-mail is February 22, 2023. That's about 14 19 days post-derailment. And he is 15 responding to and sending an e-mail to 16 Randall Hunt at NS corporation. 17 Do you see that, sir? 18 A. Yes, sir. 19 Q. And it's reference to the 20 G P L X 7 5 4 6 5 . 21 C o r r e c t ? 22 A. That's the subject heading, 23 y e s . 24 Q. And that's the hopper car. 25 That's the number 23 car that derailed,|Page 45 1 February 22, 2023. 2 Correct? 3 A. Correct. 4 Q. Okay. Let's go to page 1. 5 MS. PUJARI: For the record, 6 I'm going to note that the information 7 below the e-mail header on this 8 document at Bates 50 is faint, very 9 difficult to read, and at least 10 illegible as to my ability to read 11 this. 12 So if we could get a better 13 copy so that we can see the entirety 14 of this document, that would be 15 appreciated. 16 MR. DENTON: Well, first of 17 all, no speaking objections. 18 Second of all, this is exactly 19 the way the NS produced it to me. I 20 can't do any better than what they 21 produced to me. Sorry about that, but 22 y'all better produce better documents. 23 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 24 Q. Let's go to page 1, 49. 25 You see Mr. Hunt, after|\nreceiving this, on the very same day, within\nseven minutes, forwards it on to James L.\nWilliams at Norfolk.\nDo you see that down at the\nbottom? Bottom of 49.\nA.   Yes, sir.\nQ.   Okay. It says, \"Jamie, see the\nscreenshot confirming the car was\nhumped/classified at the TRRA before being\nbuilt into the Train 32N. The train received\na Class I brake test prior to departure.\"\nC o r r e c t ?\nA.   That's what it says.\nQ.   Okay. He sends that to Jamie,\nand Jamie responds, doesn't he? Right above\nt h a t .\nDo you see that?\nIt's dated February 22, 2023,\nat 1:21:55 p.m. It's from Tom Schnautz.\nMS. PUJARI: Objection.\nMisstates the document.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:\nQ.

And then the 215.13\npredeparture inspection.\nC o r r e c t ?\nA.   Correct.\nQ.   So these people at Norfolk\nSouthern are saying, okay, they did the air\nbrake test. Where is the predeparture\nmechanical test.\nThat's what this is about,\nr i g h t ?\nMS. PUJARI: Objection.\nMisstates the document.\nMR. DENTON: No speaking\nobjections.\nTHE WITNESS: Could you repeat\nthe question?\nQUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:\nQ.   What's going on here is Tom is\ntelling -- or Jamie is telling Tom, who got\nthis from Norfolk Southern -- or from TRRA,\nwell, yeah, you got the air brake slip; where\nis the mechanical slip?\nPage 47 1 This is what's important. Let's read through 2 t h is . 3 \"Tom, the screenshot below 4 indicates GPLX75465 was reclassified on the 5 Terminal Railroad in St. Louis between the 6 dates of 1/31 and 2/1/2023.\" 7 Are you with me? 8 A.

Yes. 16 Q. And it says, \"The attachment, 17 quote, 'air brake inspection,' end quote, 18 confirms this.\" 19 He goes on to say, \"A 20 mechanical predeparture inspection under 249 21 CFR 215.13 would be required since the car 22 was placed on the train.\" 23 C o r r e c t ? 24 A. Correct. 25 Q. And then he cites the two|Page 49 1 MS. PUJARI: Objection. 2 Misstates the document. 3 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 4 Q. That's what's going on here, 5 isn't it? 6 MS.

DENTON: Yes, you are. 13 THE WITNESS: What this tells 14 me is they have -- they had the 15 attachment, the air brake inspection, 16 to confirm, excuse me, the air brake 17 test -- 18 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 19 Q. Right. 20 A. -- and that the other piece, 21 stating that 49 CFR 215 would be required 22 since this car would be placed on the new 23 t r a in . 24 Q. Correct. 25 A. Now, at TRRA, I'm not sure if|\nthey're doing both inbound or an outbound\ninspection, but the reason they're saying\nthis car was classified -- and I believe they\nsaid earlier that the car was humped -5    Q.   Right.\nA.   -- and classified, so they're\neither doing an inbound mechanical inspection\nwhen the car comes into the yard at the TRRA\nor they're doing an outbound mechanical\ninspection.\nQ.   Maybe that's what they're\nsupposed to do. Do you have any evidence\nthat happened?\nA.   I can tell you from reviewing\nthe documents -16    Q.   What document?\nA.   -- that the hearing at the\nNTSB -19    Q.   What document?\nA.   Reviewing the transcripts from\nthe NTSB hearings.\nQ.   Okay.\nA.   The NTBS {sic} investigator in\ncharge, Mr. Payan, basically states that they\nreviewed and investigated the mechanical\nNorfolk Southern, have no idea of whether or\nnot Terminal did a mechanical inspection,\nc o r r e c t ?\nMS.

I'm not -- I have no idea if 24 somebody else from Norfolk Southern -- 25 Q. And you have -- you, being|Page 53 1 marked for identification.) 2 (Discussion off the record.) 3 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 4 Q. So you indicated that Norfolk 5 Southern hasn't talked to the Terminal 6 Railroad, but I did. 7 Do you see on page 1 of 8 Exhibit 7, this is a subpoena that we sent to 9 the Terminal Railroad Association of 10 St. Louis? 11 Do you see that? 12 A. I do. 13 Can you repeat what you just 14 said, though, because I don't believe I'd 15 agree with what you just stated? 16 Q. Have you talked to anybody -- 17 A. I personally have not, but I -- 18 Q. Has anyone from the Terminal 19 Railroad -- or from Norfolk Southern talked 20 to the Terminal Railroad about this 21 mechanical inspection? 22 A. And my response was, I am not 23 aware of any discussions -- 24 Q. Okay. 25 A. -- but I don't know.|\nQ.   Okay. But you're testifying on\nbehalf of the railroad, right?

I know it's required. I know 3 it's supposed to. 4 You have no evidence it took 5 place, do you? 6 A. Again, I can't put my hands on 7 a document, but I have read numerous -- well, 8 I read, again, from the NTSB hearings that 9 the NTSB and the chief investigator confirmed 10 that the cars were mechanically inspected and 11 a Class I brake test -- 12 Q.

Thank you. 17 (Dixon 30(b)(6) Exhibit 9 18 marked for identification.) 19 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 20 Q. All right. So I'm sure you 21 haven't seen this letter. It's a letter 22 between lawyers. It's when Norfolk Southern 23 lawyers sends documents to plaintiffs. 24 And down there at the bottom of 25 the paragraph it says, \"This production|\ncontains responsive documents to Request\nNumber 1, Exhibit 8, Plaintiff's Amended\nNotice of 30(B)(6) Deposition and requests,\"\nand it talks about the document range that\nyou, the witness, reviewed.\nDo you see that?\nAnd it goes from\nNS-CA-001617983 to 001625358.\nDo you see that?\nA.

It says, \"Class I air brake\ntest certified by the Terminal Railroad.\"\nPage 67 1 MR.

That's fine. 8 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 9 Q. Exhibit 9, the letter. 10 All I'm trying to point out, 11 it's real simple. 12 The document I'm showing you 13 from NTSB is in the range of documents that 14 they told -- the lawyers told me you 15 reviewed. 16 MS. PUJARI: Objection. 17 Misstates the letter. 18 THE WITNESS: I don't -- I 19 don't take any issue with what you 20 stated -- 21 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 22 Q. Okay. All right. 23 A. -- but I've not reviewed this 24 document. 25 Q. Okay. Well, they told me it|Page 69 1 Right? Right? 2 A. Right. 3 Q. And we've got a brake slip test 4 from Terminal that said they did that, right? 5 A. Correct. 6 Q. Okay. \"Train crew engineer and 7 conductor on duty.\" 8 They're talking about the NS 9 crew, right? 10 A. Correct. 11 Q. Okay. And then it says again, 12 \"Terminal employees did the Class I air brake 13 t e s t . \" 14 R ig h t ? 15 A. Correct. 16 Q. All right. Then it says, 17 \"Train crew conducted the predeparture 18 mechanical inspection of Train 32N.\" 19 That's not what you testified 20 to, is it? 21 A. No. I testified to what I had 22 read on the -- from the NTSB hearing. 23 Q. Well, this is an NTSB report, 24 right? It was part of the hearing? 25 A. I assume it is part of the SCD|\nr e p o r t .\nQ.   Okay. So who told NTSB that\nthe NS train crew did the mechanical\ninspection in Madison, Illinois?\nMS. PUJARI: Objection. Lack\nof foundation.\nTHE WITNESS: I'm not aware of\nwho would have informed NTSB.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:\nQ.   Because it didn't happen, did\nit? The train crew didn't inspect this\ntrain, correct?\nMS. PUJARI: Objection. Lack\nof foundation.\nTHE WITNESS: I don't know.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:\nQ.   You don't know? Norfolk\nSouthern Railway Company doesn't know if its\nown train crew inspected this train in\nMadison, Illinois?\nMS. PUJARI: Objection.\nMisstates the document. Lack of\nfoundation. Asked and answered.\nTHE WITNESS: Again, as I\nstated, what I'd -- what I had read in\nright there in front of you.\nR i g h t ?\nA.   That's correct.\nQ.   So do you think the conductor\nwalked two miles down one set of track\nlooking at 600 wheel bearings and came back\nthe other two miles? Do you think that\nh a p p e n e d ?\nMS. PUJARI: Objection. Calls\nfor speculation.

  "QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:\nQ.   This is the NTSB document.\nTrain crew conducted the inspection.\nA.   This is one NTSB document.\nQ.   Right. Okay.\nThe truth of the matter is,\nNorfolk Southern Railway has no\nunderstanding, no paperwork of its own, that\nany inspection was done on this train before\nPage 71 1 the NTSB hearings, that a qualified 2 mechanical inspection was -- was 3 completed at the TRRA on those 4 r a i lc a r s . 5 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 6 Q. The NTSB said the train crew 7 did. I'm looking at the document. 8 MS. PUJARI: Objection. 9 Misstates prior testimony. 10 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 11 Q. The train crew isn't a 12 qualified mechanical inspection, is it? 13 A. Train crews are capable of 14 mechanically inspecting a -- 15 Q. So did you talk to that 16 conductor? Did he walk that entire 200 -- or 17 two-mile-long train and inspect every wheel 18 b e a r in g ? 19 A. I'm not aware of -- myself, I'm 20 not aware of those conversations with the 21 c o n d u c t o r . 22 Q. So the train was two miles long 23 when it left Madison. You know that, don't 24 you? 163 cars? 25 The length is 10,713 feet,|Page 73 1 it left Madison, Illinois, mechanical 2 in s p e c t io n ? 3 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Lack 4 of -- argumentative and misstates 5 prior testimony. 6 THE WITNESS: Again, as I 7 stated prior, I don't have, or have 8 not seen, a particular document on 9 each car's inspection. 10 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 11 Q. All right. Let's move on then. 12 After the train leaves Madison, 13 Illinois, it's being operated by a Norfolk 14 Southern crew, an engineer and a conductor. 15 C o r r e c t ? 16 A. Correct. 17 Q. And it heads up north in 18 Illinois to Decatur, Illinois. 19 C o r r e c t ? 20 A. Correct. 21 Q. And I don't know if you know 22 the geography. I was from Illinois 23 originally. Decatur is about 120 miles from 24 M a d is o n . 25 Is that about right?|\nA.   I've been on our Illinois\ndivision, but I'm not familiar with the\ndistance between the two.\nQ.   All right. But in Madison -5 or in Decatur, Illinois, when the train gets\nthere, it goes into the yard.\nC o r r e c t ?\nA.   Correct.\nQ.   A number of cars are taken off\nthat were on the train from Madison,\nIllinois, and some other cars are put on.\nC o r r e c t ?\nA.   Correct.\nQ.   And I think one of the engines\nthat was on the front -- there were three on\nthe front -- it was moved -- one of the\nengines was moved towards the middle, or\nline 110 or 112 of the train.\nR i g h t ?\nA.   Correct.\nQ.   We call that a distributed\npower, DP, unit in the railroad lingo?\nA.   Correct.\nQ.   Okay. So let's go back to -25 all right. Let's go from there.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:\nQ.   Mr. Dixon, I want to go back to\nExhibit 8, which is the safety -- System\nSafety and Human Performance Group Chair's\nFactual Report, and I want you to look at\npage 10 of 20, please, sir.\nAnd on that page, I'm going to\nlook at 2.2, Post-Derailment Inspection of\nthe NS Train 32N's Cars.\nDo you see that?\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   It says, \"Post-derailment\ninspection was conducted by the mechanical\nfactual report.\"\nOkay. So car GPLX75465, that's\nthe hopper car.\nC o r r e c t ?\nA.   Correct.\nQ.   Okay. And that was Car\nNumber 23 in the consist.\nR i g h t ?\nA.   Correct.\nQ.   Okay. So Cars 1 through 22 did\nnot derail because they're in front of\nG P L X 7 5 4 6 5 .\nPage 75 1 And then -- 2 MR. DENTON: Do we have a map 3 of where this train route went from 4 Decatur, leaving from Madison, all the 5 way to East Palestine? Do we have a 6 Bates number for that? 7 It's NS-CA-1622398. We've got 8 an image of it. 9 And I don't know. What number 10 is this, Carrie? 10. 11 No, that's not the right one, 12 guys. It's the one that was on the 13 screen, is the right one, but that's 14 not the right one. 15 Can we take a short break 16 anyway? 17 MS. PUJARI: Sure. Take a 18 break. 19 THE WITNESS: Okay. 20 VIDEOGRAPHER: 10:32, we are 21 off the video record. 22 (Off the record at 10:32 a.m.) 23 VIDEOGRAPHER: 10:48, we are on 24 the video record. 25|Page 77 1 C o r r e c t ? 2 A. They did not derail, correct. 3 Q. But when we talk about 4 inspections, mechanical inspections, FRA went 5 out and looked at those 22 cars, and six of 6 22 had FRA defects. 7 R ig h t ? 8 A. According to this document, 9 c o r r e c t . 10 Q. Okay. Cars 23 through 60 11 derailed, so they couldn't look at those. 12 R ig h t ? 13 MS. PUJARI: Objection.

PUJARI: Sir, stating the 7 grounds of an objection is not a 8 speaking objection. 9 MR. DENTON: You're stating it 10 by giving him the answer. He had an 11 answer until you told him it was 12 beyond the scope. That's what's going 13 on here, and it's not allowed under 14 the local rules. 15 MS.

And maybe this will help 13 orientate us and help the jurors. 14 Let's go down to the image 15 right below it, which is the opposite view of 16 wheel set 1. 17 That's the opposite side where 18 the right, or R1, bearing and journal was 19 still intact. 20 Do you see that? 21 A. I do. 22 Q. And where it says, \"R1 bearing 23 and journal intact,\" that's what burned off 24 and was missing on the left side. 25 Right, sir?|Page 93 1 Q. There wasn't any other wheel 2 bearing the FRA looked at, was there, other 3 than the one that was on this hopper car? 4 A. I couldn't answer that. 5 Q. All right. Let's just talk 6 about this. The L1 wheel bearing that you 7 see on the screen, that's a mangled mess, 8 isn't it? 9 MS. PUJARI: Objection. The 10 photo speaks for itself. 11 MR. DENTON: It sure does. A 12 mangled mess. 13 MS. PUJARI: Same objection. 14 THE WITNESS: I would describe 15 it as a mangled bearing, that's for 16 s u r e . 17 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 18 Q. A mangled bearing. Okay. 19 And you see that other image to 20 the right of it, L -- the L1 journal? 21 A. I do. 22 Q. Okay. And what's a journal, 23 wheel journal, sir? 24 A. It's what houses the bearings. 25 Q. Okay. And you see the far left|\ntip of that? Looks like it's certainly\nbroken off, but it looks like it melted off.\nDo you see that?\nA.   I do see the broken piece.\nQ.   All right. Let's go to the\nnext page.\nAnd the graphic on the right is\nan exemplar. This is what a wheel bearing is\nsupposed to look like on the right when it's\nmanufactured, correct?\nThe different -- describes the\ndifferent pieces of it, right?\nA.   Correct.\nQ.   And then you see in the middle,\nthe left one, bearing off the hopper car,\nagain, is shown there.\nAnd you would call that a\nmangled wheel bearing?\nA.   Correct.\nQ.   All right. And then let's go\nto the last page of this exhibit.\nAnd these are some exemplar\nphotographs that the NTSB provided, and it\ntalks about what the inspectors are supposed\nto look at.\ntruck, right? Or an axle truck?\nA.   Yeah, connecting the two axles.\nQ.   Right. Okay.\nAnd then it -- and then the\nclose-up down there in external inspector\nview, that one down there, that's a close-up\nof the cap on top -- on what holds the\nbearing on.\nR i g h t ?\nA.   Bottom right -11        MS. PUJARI: Objection.\nWhat's -- bottom right or top?\nMR. DENTON: I'm sorry, the one\nthat's on the screen. The\ninspector -16        THE WITNESS: External view?\nQUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:\nQ.   Yeah.\nA.   Correct.\nQ.   Those three bolts, that's\nwhat's holding -22    A.   Those are the three cap\nscrews -24    Q.   Right.\nA.   -- and the cap.\nPage 95 1 Let's do the left side of that 2 document, Michael, if we could. There we go. 3 P e r f e c t . 4 Do you see that it says in the 5 bottom right picture, \"inspector external 6 view,\" with the blue arrow pointing? 7 A. I do see that. 8 Q. All right. And that's pointing 9 to the outside of the cap of the wheel 10 bearing, right? 11 A. Correct. 12 Q. And there's actually -- and 13 that's -- that -- and when we talk about a 14 railroad car, there's actually two wheel 15 bearings and two axles on the -- on either -- 16 on the front of the car -- there's one axle 17 on the front of the car that has two wheels 18 and four-wheel bearings, and there's a set on 19 the back. 20 R ig h t ? 21 A. Typically two axles on a truck. 22 Q. Right. 23 And that picture in the top 24 there, that would be what in the railroad 25 industry we call a truck. It's a wheel|Page 97 1 Q. That hold the bearing on, 2 r ig h t . 3 And then you see under that it 4 says, \"Inspector under-car view.\" 5 That's what the inspector is 6 supposed to look at when they inspect, these 7 qualified mechanical inspections. 8 R ig h t ? 9 A. Correct. 10 Q. And then let's look at the 11 right side of that exhibit. 12 And again, these are exemplar 13 pictures the NTSB provided at the hearing, 14 but it shows examples of what the inspector 15 is supposed to look for. 16 Do you see that top picture of 17 a wheel bearing that says they look for 18 \"clearly formed droplets\"? 19 Do you see that? 20 A. I do. 21 Q. The red arrow pointing to it? 22 And then the two other arrows 23 on the wheel bearing on the right side of 24 that picture, do you see that? 25 A. I do.|\nQ.   And then the inspector is\nsupposed to look for the \"inboard seal,\" if\nit's out of position. That's the middle\npicture with the red arrow.\nDo you see that?\nA.   I do see the picture of the\ninbound {sic} seal.\nQ.   Okay.\nA.   Inboard seal.\nQ.   And then down at the bottom,\nthere's some exemplar pictures of a bearing\nleak, indicating slung grease on the truck\nfrom the wheel bearing.\nDo you see those various\na r r o w s ?\nA.   I do see those arrows.\nQ.   And that's what a mechanical\ninspector is supposed to look at during this\nrequired inspection on each and every wheel\nset on the train, right?\nMS. PUJARI: Objection. Lack\nof foundation.\nTHE WITNESS: Those are some of\nthe things rail inspectors are trying\nto identify when inspecting a train.\nA.   I'm sorry.\nQ.   Okay. And so I just want to\nkind of -4        MS. PUJARI: Sorry, Counsel.\nIn terms of the notice, I don't\nbelieve it is -- oh, 54 to 141.\nOkay. Thank you. Sorry about\nthat.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:\nQ.   Okay. So I want to ask you\nabout the derailment response. And I'm just\ngoing to do kind of a high level right now to\njust kind of put timelines in context.\nWe can agree the derailment\noccurred on February 3, 2023, at about\np.m.\nC o r r e c t ?\nA.   Correct.\nQ.   And there was an immediate\nf i r e .\nC o r r e c t ?\nA.   I believe there was.\nQ.   Okay. And then there's a lot\nof emergency response from a lot of people\ntrying to battle the fire, but I want to kind\nPage 99 1 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 2 Q. Okay. All right. So I'm going 3 to switch gears. All those documents you can 4 probably set aside for now. I'm going to 5 change topics, if you don't mind, and I'll 6 set the stage here. 7 I want to talk about the 8 derailment response. That was, I think, 9 paragraphs 72 to 100 in the third-party 10 complaint. 11 Let's go to paragraph 72, 12 page 16, Michael. There it is. 13 You see where F, it says, 14 \"Derailment response\"? Do you see that? 15 A. I do. 16 Q. And that whole page is all 17 painted yellow, highlighted yellow, because 18 those are all things that you were asked to 19 be prepared to testify about. 20 Correct? 21 A. I have reviewed this, yes. 22 Q. You have reviewed this? Is 23 that what you said, sir? 24 A. Yes. 25 Q. Okay.|Page 101 1 of move forward to the next date in this 2 document, which is paragraph 76. 3 There's a mention in here by 4 Norfolk Southern that on February 4th, early, 5 sometime after midnight, so that must be just 6 a few hours after the derailment, the vinyl 7 chloride tank cars began activating and 8 releasing pressure in a cycle of 30 seconds 9 on, releasing, and two minutes off. 10 Is that your understanding? 11 A. That is my understanding. 12 Q. Okay. And the vinyl chloride, 13 you understand, was hazardous material, 14 right, that was in those tank cars? 15 A. Correct. 16 Q. And there were a total of five 17 of them that were involved in the derailment 18 and the surrounding pool of fires. 19 C o r r e c t ? 20 A. Correct. 21 Q. And frankly, those -- but those 22 weren't the only railcars that burned. There 23 were other tank cars that had material in 24 them that burned. 25 R ig h t ?|\nIn addition to the vinyl\nchloride cars.\nR i g h t ?\nA.   Correct.\nQ.   There were hopper cars with\nplastic pellets that were burning.\nR i g h t ?\nA.   Correct.\nQ.   There were boxcars, I think.\nOne of them even had a bunch of beer in it.\nSomebody didn't get their beer. It burned\nu p .\nR i g h t ?\nA.   I believe there were some\nboxcars that were -- that sustained fire\nd a m a g e .\nQ.   Okay. And one of the documents\nyou mentioned that you looked at with respect",
  "to the derailment response was the hazardous\nmaterials report from the NTSB.\nAm I right about that?\nA.   Correct.\nDixon 30(b)(6) Exhibit 13",
  "marked for identification.)\nOkay. And I just want to go\ndown, about two-thirds down. It shows that\nRobert Wood, Norfolk Southern Railway,\nAtlanta, Georgia, was a group member.\nDo you see that?",
  "A.   I do.\nQ.   And I think that was one person\nyou said you may have talked to in\npreparation for the deposition.\nYou told me that earlier,\ndidn't you?\nA.   That was. What I had stated\nis, I had a question concerning -- that I\nposed to Robert Wood concerning the emergency\nresponse guide and confirming that 2020 -16 2020 was the last version.\nQ.   Okay. So the point of it is,\nRobert Wood is knowledgeable about HAZMAT at\nthe NS, right? He's one of the managers?\nA.   I believe he does have\nknowledge of HAZMAT.\nQ.   Okay. And he was on -- and he\nwas part of the group that wrote this report.\nR i g h t ?\nA.   I don't know if he wrote\nPage 103 1 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 2 Q. Okay. I'm going to try to get 3 that document out. We'll mark it. It's a 4 big, thick one, unfortunately. 5 And, Michael, for the -- it's 6 NS-CA-001624324, but it's marked as Exhibit 7 Number 13. 8 Okay. And this is the 9 Hazardous Materials Group Chair's Factual 10 R e p o r t . 11 You said you reviewed that one, 12 r ig h t ? 13 A. I didn't read every single 14 word, but I have reviewed most of the -- most 15 of the document here. 16 Q. Okay. Well, let's -- I'm not 17 going to read it all, it's 150 pages, but I'm 18 going to ask you about parts of it, if you'll 19 work with me. 20 If we go to page 5 of 158. 21 Are you able to get that, sir? 22 A. I am. 23 Q. I think you'll do better if you 24 take the paperclip off. That's what I just 25 found out. But it's up to you.|Page 105 1 anything. I'm thinking he was part -- 2 Q. But he was a group member for 3 this report. 4 R ig h t ? 5 A. He was a group member, yes. 6 Q. All right. Let's just go right 7 over to page 6 of 158. I think it's just one 8 o v e r . 9 And I'm not going to go through 10 everything, but train information down at the 11 bottom of the page, it says, \"11 of the 12 derailed tank cars contained hazardous 13 materials, including five tank cars with 14 stabilized vinyl chloride monomer, one tank 15 car each of isobutylene butyl acrylate, 16 2-ethylhexyl acrylate, ethylene glycol 17 monobutyl ether, and two tank cars of benzene 18 r e s id u e . \" 19 Is that your understanding, 20 that all of those hazardous materials cars 21 d e r a i le d ? 22 A. Yes. 23 Q. All right. Let's go to page 8 24 of 158. 25 I don't know if you can blow|\nthat up a little bit, the map, Michael.\nThis is an aerial photograph\nthat shows some of the derailment.\nDo you see that?\nA.   I do.\nQ.   And the -- I think the red\nnumbers, if I read this correctly, are at\nleast four of the Oxy Vinyl -- not Oxy\nVinyl -- vinyl chloride cars.\nDo you see that? 28, 29, 30,\nbottom paragraph?\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   And then at the top, I think\nCar Number 50 -- what is that? I can't read\nit. It's too small for my eyes. But it's\nthe other vinyl chloride car, the one down.\nIt's 55.\nRight? Do you see that?\nA.   I have Car 53.\nQ.   Okay. Well, sometimes these\nnumbers get off. But the bottom line is,\nthis is an aerial photograph that shows the\nd e r a i l m e n t .\nRight? Part of the derailment?\nA.   Correct.\nBut the bottom line is,\nor 887,000 pounds of vinyl\nchloride in those five cars.\nR i g h t ?\nA.   Correct.\nQ.   115,000 gallons in the vinyl\nchloride cars, just those five cars.\nR i g h t ?\nA.   I'm not going to do the math on\nit. It's 887,000 pounds.\nQ.   Well, they did the -- the NTSB\ndid the math for us.\nA.   Okay. The 15. The 15, I see\nit.\nQ.   Okay. I wasn't trying to be -16    A.   Oh, I didn't see that.\nQ.   Okay. All right. Then I want\nto go to page -- I'm going to jump around\njust a little bit and put into perspective\neverything that's been dispersed into the\nenvironment here.\nLet's go to page 45 of 158.\nAnd you see that chart. That's\na summary of the breaching damage and\nhazardous materials released as a result of\nPage 107 1 Q. Okay. And there's some attempt 2 to try to point out where the vinyl chloride 3 cars are and where other cars are, right? 4 A. Correct. 5 Q. Okay. Let's go over to 9 of 6 158. And there's a chart down there at the 7 bottom that I'd like you to pull out, and it 8 says this is the bill of lading on the vinyl 9 chloride cars. And let's see if it checks 10 with the list you brought here to your 11 deposition, sir. 12 Car 28, TILX car; 29, 30, an 13 Oxy car; 31's GATX car; and 55 is an Oxy car. 14 Does that match your list? 15 A. It does. 16 Q. Okay. And if we look at this, 17 based upon the bill of lading -- and that's a 18 document that describes what's inside the 19 tank cars. 20 C o r r e c t ? 21 A. Correct. 22 Q. It says that the five vinyl 23 chloride cars, they had a -- between 178,300 24 net weight down to -- I think the smallest 25 one was 176.|Page 109 1 the derailment. It has the five vinyl 2 chloride cars, but it also has these other 3 hazardous materials that were released. 4 Do you see that? 5 A. I do. 6 Q. Car 36, 38 and 50? 7 A. Yes. 8 Q. All right. And then if we go 9 to page 56 of 158, there's a summary of the 10 nonhazardous commodity tank car breaches. 11 Do you see that? 12 A. I do. 13 Q. And it says the entire load of 14 propylene glycol was dumped onto the ground, 15 petroleum lube and these other chemicals, the 16 entire load, because these cars were actually 17 damaged to where they were punctured, to 18 where the contents spilled on their own out 19 onto the ground. 20 R ig h t ? 21 MS. PUJARI: Objection. 22 Compound. 23 THE WITNESS: Could you restate 24 the question? 25|\nQUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:\nQ.   Yeah, it wasn't a very good\nquestion. I'll withdraw it.\nThis is just other materials\nfrom other cars other than the vinyl chloride\ncars that were breached and released their\nl o a d .\nR i g h t ?\nA.   Correct.\nQ.   And all of these cars, the\nreason we have a fire out there is because of\nthe wheel bearing being on fire.\nRight?\nMS. PUJARI: Objection. Calls\nfor expert testimony. Lack of\nfoundation.\nTHE WITNESS: Yeah, I don't\nknow why -- if that's the only reason\nwe have a fire.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:\nQ.   Well, can you think of any\nother reason?\nMS. PUJARI: Objection. Calls\nfor -25\nQ.   Right.\nA.   I can't tell you if there -- I\nmean, to answer your question is, I don't\nknow. I don't think the investigation is\ncomplete to say this was the cause.\nQ.   Nine months into it, Norfolk\nSouthern doesn't accept the fact that the\nwheel bearing that was on fire that we all\njust saw didn't cause this fire?\nMS. PUJARI: Objection.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:\nQ.   Is that Norfolk Southern's\ntestimony?\nMS. PUJARI: Objection. Asked\nand answered. Argumentative.\nTHE WITNESS: My testimony is\nthat, as I stated before, we saw the\npictures of the fire underneath the\nrailcar.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:\nQ.   Right.\nA.   And to the extent could that\nhave been the ignition source for fires?\nIt's a possibility that that's -25    Q.   Okay.\nPage 111 1 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 2 Q. Kids weren't out there with 3 matches, were they? 4 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Calls 5 for speculation. 6 THE WITNESS: Repeat the 7 question for me, please. 8 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 9 Q. The only reason these cars are 10 on fire is because the wheel bearing was on 11 fire. That was the ignition source. 12 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Calls 13 for expert testimony. Asked and 14 answered. 15 THE WITNESS: I don't know that 16 to be the case. 17 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 18 Q. Do you know of any other 19 ignition source other than the wheel bearing 20 we all saw on the video that was on fire? 21 A. Again, I think this is being 22 investigated. Anytime you have a derailment, 23 there are going to be cars hitting the 24 ground, hitting ballast, hitting all sorts of 25 things, tanks being punctured.|Page 113 1 A. -- that was the ignition 2 source. 3 Q. Okay. Thank you. 4 Let's go back -- now I'm going 5 backwards a little bit, I'm sorry, but I want 6 to go back to page 12 and 13 of 58 {sic}. 7 And this is some of the other 8 chemicals that were hazardous materials that 9 were breached and burned and that was 10 contained in this report, this hazardous 11 material report, that you reviewed. 12 Correct? 13 A. So what paragraph are you 14 referencing? 15 Q. Page 12. I want to go 3.2.1, 16 ethylene glycol monobutyl ether physical and 17 chemical properties. That was one of the 18 tank cars that breached and burned. 19 See that? 20 A. I see that. 21 Q. And then I just want to go over 22 to page 13 under General Hazards. 23 \"The product is toxic.\" 24 Do you see that? 25 A. I do see that.|\nQ.   \"Fumes and vapors are heavier\nthan air.\"\nDo you see that?\nA.   I do.\nQ.   The very last sentence of that\nparagraph, \"It may\" -- this can -- \"It may\ncause headache, dizziness, incoordination,\nnausea, vomiting, diarrhea and general\nweakness.\"\nDo you see that, sir?\nA.   I do.\nQ.   Then if you go up a little bit\nin that paragraph, it begins with \"The SDS\"\non the right side of that paragraph.\nNo, the next SDS. There you\ngo. Follow along.\nThe SDS states that ethylene\nglycol monobutyl ether is regarded as the\nmost toxic of all glycol ethers.\"\nDo you see that?\nA.   I do see that.\nQ.   All right. That's just one of\nthe tank cars that burned, right?\nMS. PUJARI: Objection.\nAssumes facts not in evidence.\nA.   I do.\nQ.   All right. Let's go to 16 of\nbutyl acrylate.\nDo you see that?\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   Right there in the middle.\nContact with butyl acrylate may cause skin\nirritation, allergic skin reaction, serious\neye irritation, respiratory irritation. May\nbe harmful if inhaled. It's harmful to\naquatic life, with long-lasting effects.\"\nDo you see that?\nA.   I do.\nQ.   You read the news reports of\nall the dead fish in the streams, didn't you,\nafter this derailment?\nA.   I read some news reports that\nhad mentioned aquatic life.\nQ.   All right. Then let's go over\nto page 17 of 158 where they start talking\nabout the vinyl chloride.\nOkay?\nAnd the actual name of what was\nin the -- what we refer to as the vinyl\nchloride tank cars was a substance known as\nPage 115 1 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 2 Q. Okay? 3 A. I think that was a product 4 involved in the derailment. I don't see any 5 reference to the tank car on this. 6 Q. Well, there's no reason it 7 would be in the hazardous materials report 8 for this derailment if it wasn't part of the 9 derailment, would it, sir? 10 A. No. 11 Q. All right. Let's go to the 14 12 to 158, 3.31. 13 This is my favorite. 14 Ethylhexyl. My Aunt Ethel, it reminds me of 15 her every time. 16 Ethylhexyl acrylate and the 17 physical and chemical properties. 18 Do you see that? 19 A. I do. 20 Q. Down at the bottom of that 21 section it says, \"The SDS states that 22 ethylhexyl acrylate may cause skin 23 irritation, allergic skin reaction and 24 respiratory irritation.\" 25 Do you see that?|Page 117 1 vinyl chloride monomer. 2 Correct? 3 A. Correct. 4 Q. And throughout this litigation, 5 I've seen some places in the reports they 6 refer to that as VCM. 7 Have you seen that? 8 A. I have. 9 Q. Okay. So we're talking about 10 the vinyl chloride. And let's go to the next 11 page, page 18 of 50 -- of 158. 12 And let's talk about the 13 paragraph that starts at Section 2, the vinyl 14 chloride monomer, SDS. Talks about the 15 problems that they put in their SDS. 16 Let's look at that. Bullet 17 point 1. \"Vinyl chloride is a known human 18 cancer agent.\" 19 Do you see that? 20 A. I do. 21 Q. Next dot. \"May produce, among 22 other things, central nervous system 23 depression, including headaches, dizziness, 24 nausea, loss of balance and drowsiness.\" 25 Do you see that, sir?|\nA.

All right. So let's go to\npage 74 of this document. 74, 158.\nYep, that's it. I want to talk\nabout the incident response.\nWhen we're talking about the\nincident here, this is the response to the\nderailment.\nRight?\nA.   Correct.\nQ.   8.1 talks about the initial\nrailroad response actions. It looks like in\nthe first bullet point, Norfolk Southern\nhired a contractor, SPSI.\nDo you see that?\nA.   I do.\nQ.   Okay. Let's move over to\npage 76 of 158.\nAt the top it says, \"On\nFebruary 5, 2023, at 18:00, Norfolk Southern\nPage 119 1 Q. Okay. It's not good to have it 2 in your backyard? 3 MS. BROZ: Objection.

Let's go to page 20, 10 158, up at the top. It talks about hazardous 11 decomposition products of vinyl chloride. 12 Do you see that? 13 A. Can you state that again? 14 Q. Yeah. Hazardous decomposition 15 products. 16 A. Okay. I do. 17 Q. And it tells you what they are. 18 Oxides of carbon. 19 Right? 20 A. Correct. 21 Q. Chlorine? 22 A. Correct. 23 Q.

But February 5th -- 10 let's put this in perspective -- the 11 derailment is at, let's call it, nine o'clock 12 Friday night, correct? That's February 3rd? 13 A. Correct. 14 Q. So February 5th is a Sunday, 15 right? 16 A. I believe that is -- yes. 17 Q. And at 18:00, that's military 18 time, so that would be 6 p.m. on Sunday. 19 Right? 20 A. Correct. 21 Q. And what's going on here is 22 they're -- that the contractors at NS are 23 monitoring the VCM tank cars, the vinyl 24 chloride tank cars, to figure out what to do 25 with them.|\nCorrect?\nA.   I believe there was a lot of\nthings still going on, but was there -- was\nthere a monitoring of the vinyl tank cars at\nthe same time? Yes.\nQ.

I would say that's a better -5 a more accurate description, set off\ndischarges to open two holes, one at the top,\none at the bottom, for a vent and burn. I\nwould not describe that as blowing up\nr a i l c a r s .\nQ.   Well, you blew two holes into\nthe railcars, steel railcars, and set them on\nfire, right? \"You\" being NS?\nMS. PUJARI: Objection to the\ncharacterization. Asked and answered.\nArgumentative.\nTHE WITNESS: I would say we\nconducted a successful vent and burn.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:\nQ.   Successful?\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   Successful.\nHow do you define -- how does\nNorfolk Southern define \"success\"?\nA.   When you're trying to conduct a\nvent and burn, you obviously have -- you have\nPage 123 1 MS. PUJARI: Objection. 2 Compound. 3 THE WITNESS: Not prior to the 4 vent and burn. 5 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 6 Q. Not until you blew them up. 7 R ig h t ? 8 MS. PUJARI: Objection. 9 Objection to the characterization. 10 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 11 Q. Well, that's what NS did. They 12 put dynamite on these cars and blew two holes 13 in them. 14 R ig h t ? 15 A. I would say -- 16 MS. PUJARI: Objection to the 17 characterization. 18 You can answer. 19 THE WITNESS: Yeah, I would say 20 vent and burn is not blowing up a 21 r a i lc a r . 22 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 23 Q. Well, you put explosives in the 24 top of the car, \"you\" being NS and your 25 contractors, at the top of the car and at the|Page 125 1 personnel in harm's way with a purpose of, 2 again, creating through those set explosives 3 an opening on one end -- on top of the car 4 and on the bottom so any other product or 5 lading can drain. 6 Q. And burn? 7 A. Drain. 8 Q. And burn? 9 A. And burn. 10 Q. Into the environment. Into the 11 village of East Palestine, right? Right 12 d o w n t o w n . 13 MS. PUJARI: Objection. 14 Argumentative. 15 And please let the witness 16 complete his answer. 17 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 18 Q. This happened -- excuse me. Go 19 ahead. Finish your -- 20 A. So when I say it was 21 successful, what I'm referring to is the vent 22 and burn, as designed, was implemented. 23 There was no -- at the time, we didn't have 24 individuals setting those charges. They did 25 them, you know, as they were to supposed to|\ndo. And when I say it's a success, is the\nplanned vent and burn went according to plan.\nQ.   But I want to get into the\ndecision why the vent and burn ever became\nthe plan.\nCan we talk about that?\nA.   Sure.\nQ.   All right. Because it says\nright here on page 76 of 158 that to conduct\na vent and burn, that's the last resort.\nDo you see that in there?\nMS. PUJARI: Can you\nreference -14        THE WITNESS: Could you\npoint -16 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:\nQ.   Yeah. It's the one, two -18 third bullet point. Right there.\nA.   I see that.\nQ.   All right. So let's move on a\nlittle bit.\nMS. PUJARI: And, Counsel,\ncould you orient us to the paragraphs\nof the complaint that you are focused\non at the moment under the notice?\nto you just a little bit about that. It's\nthe Specialized Response Solutions, SRS,\nactions.\nDo you see that paragraph?\nA.   I do see the paragraph.\nQ.   And that was another contractor\nthat Norfolk Southern brought on to respond\nto the derailment.\nIs that right?\nA.   That's correct.\nQ.   So we have SPSI as one\ncontractor NS hired, and we have SRS as\nanother one.\nCorrect?\nA.   That is my understanding, yes.\nQ.   Okay. And in the first\nparagraph it says the first thing that SRS\ndid was to do a damage assessment of the",
  "vinyl chloride cars, formulate wrecking,\nclearing plans and identify loads versus\nempties within the derailment.\nCorrect?\nA.   That's what's written, yes.\nQ.   And then the next paragraph,\nthe senior project manager observed active\nPage 127 1 MR. DENTON: All of these. It 2 all talks about derailment response. 3 It starts at paragraph 72. This is 4 all part of the derailment response, 5 72 through 100 and something. 120, 6 137, 185. 7 MS. PUJARI: Thank you, 8 Counsel. 9 MR. DENTON: You're welcome. 10 Let's take a short break. 11 Could we? 12 MS. PUJARI: Sure. 13 VIDEOGRAPHER: 11:44, we are 14 off the video record. 15 (Off the record at 11:44 a.m.) 16 VIDEOGRAPHER: 11:57, we are on 17 the video record. 18 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 19 Q. All right, sir, I want to 20 continue with talking to you about the 21 Exhibit 13, which is this hazardous materials 22 group report that you told us you reviewed. 23 And I want to go to page 82 of 24 158, if you could join me there, please. 25 And it's 8.2.2. I want to talk|Page 129 1 fires involving materials constructed of 2 wood, plastic pellets -- 3 That was what was in the hopper 4 car, correct, plastic pellets? 5 A. Correct. 6 Q. Railroad ties, lubricating oil, 7 glycols, acrylates. 8 So they're still burning on 9 February 5th, the morning of February 5th, 10 which was Sunday morning. 11 Right? 12 A. Yes, that's what's written. 13 Q. Okay. Let's go to the next -- 14 let's skip a couple pages. Let's go to 86 of 15 158, and I want to talk to you about 8.3, Oxy 16 Vinyl communications. 17 Do you see that? 18 A. I do see that. 19 Q. And just to orientate the jury, 20 Oxy Vinyls is the shipper of the vinyl 21 chloride monomer that was in the five tank 22 cars. 23 Correct? 24 A. Correct. 25 Q. In fact, Oxy Vinyls is also the|\nmanufacturer of that product. That's the\nbusiness they're in, is to make and ship VCM.\nRight?\nA.   I believe that's a product -5 I'm not quite sure if Oxy Vinyls only\nproduces -7    Q.   Well, I'm not sure it's the\nonly thing -9    A.   -- the vinyl chloride -10    Q.   -- but certainly that's one of\ntheir products?\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   Okay. And certainly one would\nexpect that Oxy Vinyls would understand the\nproperties of a hazardous material that it\nmanufactures and ships across the country.\nWouldn't you agree with that\nconcept, sir?",
  "MS. PUJARI: Objection to the\nextent it calls for speculation.\nTHE WITNESS: I believe they're\nrequired to communicate hazards\nrelated to that product for shipping\npurposes.\nQ.   About the characteristics of\nvinyl chloride monomer.\nRight?\nA.   Right.\nQ.   It goes on to say that the Oxy\nVinyls team met with SPSI and SRS to discuss\nthe derailed tank cars.\nRight?\nA.   It does state that they met\nwith them to obtain a situation briefing,\nyes.\nQ.   All right. Then I want to go\nto page 88 of 158, because Oxy was notified\nthat the Norfolk Southern contractors and\nNorfolk Southern wanted to conduct a vent and\nburn, in other words, put dynamite charges on\ntwo places on these railcars and burn up the\nproduct.\nThat was the communication that\nwas going on and the decision whether or not\nto do that.\nRight?\nA.   What paragraph are you\nreferencing?\nQ.   I'm not referring to any\nPage 131 1 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 2 Q. But wouldn't you expect, sir, 3 as a Norfolk Southern representative, that 4 Oxy Vinyls, the manufacturer of this product, 5 would be a subject expert on the properties 6 of that VCM? 7 A. Yes. 8 Q. Okay. And so let's discuss 9 that. 10 We know that at some point 11 there was communication from Norfolk Southern 12 to Oxy Vinyls about the derailment. 13 Correct? 14 A. Correct. 15 Q. And in fact, at 8.3.1, it shows 16 that Oxy Vinyls had three representatives at 17 the derailment site on February 5th between 18 14:00 and 14:30. 19 Do you see that? 20 That's 2 to 2:30 on Sunday, 21 there's actually Oxy Vinyls folks present in 22 East Palestine, Ohio, right, to provide 23 technical assistance? 24 Right? 25 A. I see that.|Page 133 1 paragraph. I'm just referring to what was 2 going on. 3 A. I don't know -- 4 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Vague 5 as to time. 6 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 7 Q. You don't know? 8 A. I don't know what the 9 discussions was with Oxy Vinyls throughout 10 the whole period. 11 Q. I understand that. 12 A. So that's why I'm asking -- 13 Q. Okay. Well, I'm just trying 14 to -- yeah, let me withdraw the question. 15 Let me help you. Okay? Fair enough. I'm 16 just trying to set the stage. 17 One of the -- the discussion 18 that was really going on between the NS and 19 its contractors and Oxy Vinyls was, what do 20 we do with the five derailed vinyl chloride 21 cars and the VCM that's within them. 22 That was the general topic, 23 right? 24 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Vague 25 as to time.|\nTHE WITNESS: Again, I don't\nknow what the -- the discussions that\ntook place. All I can say is that I\nknow Oxy Vinyls sent representatives.\nI would assume that the NS\ncontractors and NS personnel and the\nresponse team there would have been\nhaving discussions ongoing -9 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:\nQ.   Right.\nA.   -- from the start of the\nderailment.\nAgain, once Oxy Vinyls'\nrepresentatives got there, they would\nprobably have been included in some\ndiscussions.\nQ.   Well, let's go back to page 86\nof 158. Let's just look what the report\nprovided that you reviewed.\nIt says, quote, down at the\nbottom, \"The Oxy Vinyls team met with SPSI\npresident, SRS representatives, for a\nbriefing.\" Held it at the SPSI office in a\ntrailer.\nWhat were the topics they\nrepresentative of SRS.\nA.   And you stated who else from -3    Q.   That was it. That's all I\nstated.\nA.   So the Oxy Vinyls team -6    Q.   It says the Oxy Vinyls team,\nwhich the paragraph above says three",
  "individuals, and the president of SPSI and\nSRS, they all got together to talk about\ntopics, which are those four bullet points\nthat we have highlighted on the screen.\nRight?\nA.   I don't dispute that.\nQ.   Okay. Very good.\nMR. DENTON: I need a short\nbreak. My numbers are out of order.\nGive me just a second off the record.\nVIDEOGRAPHER: 12:07, we are\noff the video record.\nOff the record at 12:07 p.m.)\nVIDEOGRAPHER: 12:09, we are on\nthe video record.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:\nQ.   Let's go to page 90 of 158, the\nbottom paragraph.\nPage 135 1 discussed? Location of the derailed tank 2 cars; the temperatures of the vinyl chloride 3 tank cars; concerns about polymerization of 4 the tank cars; and the possibility of 5 conducting a vent and burn of the VCM tank 6 cars. 7 So that's what they were 8 talking about, right? 9 A. That's what's written here. I 10 would assume that's correct. 11 Q. Well, you're the Norfolk 12 Southern representative. That's in fact what 13 happened, right? 14 MS. PUJARI: Objection to form. 15 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 16 Q. And this is the report you said 17 you studied, and Robert Wood was a member of 18 the team. 19 Do you have any reason to 20 dispute this report? 21 A. I don't dispute what's written 22 on this paper. I don't know who was involved 23 in that briefing with Oxy Vinyls. 24 Q. Well, it says right here on 25 this paper. The SPSI president. A|Page 137 1 It's talking about the next 2 contact between the Oxy Vinyls Dallas team 3 and SPSI occurred on the early morning of 4 February 5, 2023. 5 Do you see that? 6 A. I do see that. 7 Q. Same individuals, mostly, who 8 participated on the February 4th call. 9 Do you see that? 10 A. I do. 11 Q. And it says, \"SPSI raised the 12 topic of the VCM polymerization within the 13 tank cars and the possibility of conducting a 14 vent and burn.\" 15 Do you see where I'm at? 16 A. I do see that. 17 Q. And Oxy Vinyls, who 18 manufactured the VCM and shipped the VCM, 19 said, quote, in re -- well, no quote. 20 In response, the Oxy Vinyls 21 senior vice president of manufacturing, who 22 wasn't on the February 4th, reportedly 23 interjected, quote -- follow me? -- \"Let me 24 be clear. Polymerization is not occurring,\" 25 end quote.|\nCan you underline that in red,\nplease, Michael, that quote?\nDo you see that?\nA.   I do see it written here, yes.\nQ.   Okay. So the senior vice\npresident of manufacturing at Oxy Vinyls, the\ncompany that makes this product, this VCM, is\nmaking it perfectly clear that polymerization\nis not occurring.\nCorrect? That's what he told\nNS and its contractors.\nMS. PUJARI: Objection to the\ncharacterization. The document speaks\nfor itself.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:\nQ.   Right?\nA.   That's what's written here.\nQ.   And polymerization was the\nreason that -- well, strike that. Let me\nwithdraw that.\nLet's go on to this same\nparagraph. And it says, last sentence,\nAccording to the Oxy Vinyls vice president\nHess, he further suggested that if a vent and\nburn is being considered, it should be done\nBut go ahead.\nTHE WITNESS: The reason I\nwanted the question asked again is, I\nwould not state -- I can't necessarily\nagree with \"the leading expert.\" I\nwould say that, as I stated before,\nOxy Vinyl obviously has expertise in\nvinyl chloride.\nI know we have a statement here\nfrom -- according to the Oxy Vinyls\nvice president Hess, he suggested.\nAnd I read what's written here, and I\nagree what's written here.\nBut I would just again state, I\ndon't necessarily agree with \"the\nleading expert of vinyl chloride.\"\nQUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:\nQ.   Okay. Certainly an expert of\nvinyl chloride?\nA.   I would agree that he has some\nexpertise in vinyl chloride.\nQ.   All right. And let's be\nperfectly clear. He said, quote, \"Let me be\nme clear. Polymerization is not occurring,\"\nend quote.\nPage 139 1 because of\" -- \"not be done\" -- not, 2 underline \"not\" because I misspoke -- \"not be 3 done because of polymerization, because 4 polymerization is not occurring.\" 5 Right? 6 A. That's what's written. 7 Q. So the subject matter expert on 8 VCM, vice president of manufacturing, made it 9 perfectly clear to NS and its contractors 10 there was no need to vent and burn these tank 11 cars. 12 MS. PUJARI: Objection. 13 Mischaracterizes the document. 14 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 15 Q. Correct, sir? 16 A. Can you restate the question? 17 MR. DENTON: Thank you, Carrie. 18 (Court Reporter read back 19 question.) 20 MS. PUJARI: Mischaracterizes 21 the document. 22 THE WITNESS: Yeah, I would -- 23 MR. DENTON: If that's not a 24 leading -- or a speaking objection, I 25 don't know what it is.|Page 141 1 Right? 2 A. That's what is stated here, 3 yes. 4 Q. All right. And there was no 5 reason to vent and burn these tank cars 6 because of a polymerization. It would have 7 to be for some other reason. 8 Right? 9 That's -- that was the position 10 of Oxy Vinyls, correct? 11 A. I believe that is the position 12 of Mr. -- Vice President Hess at Oxy Vinyls. 13 Q. Well, let's see what happened 14 after that. Let's go to the next page, 15 page 91. 16 The on-site team from Oxy 17 Vinyls -- it's the second full paragraph, 18 last two lines. The outcome of that meeting 19 on February 5th was \"an agreement that Oxy 20 Vinyls' on-site team would continue to convey 21 the message to SPSI that there was no signs 22 of polymerization occurring within the tank 23 cars.\" 24 Do you see that? 25 A. I do see that.|\nQ.   So Oxy Vinyls is telling NS and\nits two contractors, no polymerization,\nright?\nMS. PUJARI: Objection.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:\nQ.   That's what they're saying to\nthem. That's the advice they're giving them.\nMS. PUJARI: Objection.\nMischaracterization as to Oxy Vinyls.\nTHE WITNESS: I guess the -- my\nresponse would be the meeting that\nyou're referring to, the outcome of\nthat meeting was an agreement that the\nOxy Vinyls on-site team would convey\nthe message to SPSI that there was no\nsigns of polymerization occurring\nwithin the tank cars.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:\nQ.   All right. And then it goes on\nto say, last sentence of that paragraph, \"At\nthis point, SPSI and Norfolk Southern did not",
  "direct any further questions or provide any\nsituation updates to the Oxy Vinyls Dallas\nteam.\"\nDo you see that?\nQUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:\nQ.   Right?\nA.   I think the answer to that is\nthey were basically making a claim, Mr. Hess\nand the vice president, that polymerization\nwas not occurring.\nQ.   Right.\nThat was Oxy Vinyls' position,\nright?\nA.   That was not everybody from -11 that I'm -- I can speak to would say that was\neverybody at Oxy Vinyl on that on-site team,\nbut those individuals made those statements,\nas I read earlier.\nQ.   The on-site team from Oxy and\nthe vice president of manufacturing in Dallas\non a conference call, all the Oxy people\nsaid, no polymerization, no need to vent and\nburn.\nRight?\nMS. PUJARI: Objection.\nMisstates evidence.\nTHE WITNESS: You had an\non-site Oxy Vinyl representative prior\nto that meeting making the claim that\nPage 143 1 A. I do see that. 2 Q. And so this was -- that was on 3 February 5th. So let's move forward to 4 page 93 of 158, the decision to vent and burn 5 the tank cars. 6 So here we are. Oxy Vinyls 7 says, don't vent and burn. They're not asked 8 back to any of the meetings. 9 And then SPSI and SRS and 10 Norfolk make plans to go forward to go ahead 11 and vent and burn the tank cars, right? 12 MS. PUJARI: Objection. 13 Compound and misstates prior evidence. 14 THE WITNESS: Could you repeat 15 the question, please? 16 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 17 Q. All right. So we know Oxy 18 Vinyls has said -- their vice president of 19 manufacturing said, no polymerization, no 20 need to vent and burn. 21 That's where we're at from 22 their point of view, right? 23 MS. PUJARI: Objection. 24 Misstates evidence. 25|Page 145 1 he was not sure or he was -- he 2 couldn't say with a definite response 3 that polymerization was not occurring 4 or could not occur. 5 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 6 Q. And that's why you got Mr. Hess 7 down in Dallas on the phone, the main man 8 down at Oxy, for this chemical said, don't 9 blow them up, they're not going to 10 polymerize. 11 Right? 12 MS. PUJARI: Objection. 13 Misstates evidence. Prior testimony 14 and lack of foundation. 15 THE WITNESS: I don't believe 16 that -- that having the main man 17 somewhere else at a location that's 18 not on site takes away from the fact 19 that you had an on-site rep that 20 wasn't sure. 21 I believe what you stated is 22 what's written here, that he made the 23 statement -- 24 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 25 Q. Right.|\nA.   -- at some point that\npolymerization was not occurring.\nQ.   Right.\nAnd as soon as that statement\nwas made, the Oxy Vinyl people on scene were\nexcluded from all further discussions with\nNorfolk Southern and its contractors.\nCorrect?\nMS. PUJARI: Objection.\nMisstates evidence.\nMR. DENTON: It does not. It's\nright in the report. Quit making\nthose stupid objections.\nMS. PUJARI: Excuse me? I will\nmake the objections that I am",
  "permitted and allowed to make.\nMR. DENTON: Let's go -- I'll\nwithdraw the question so your\nobjection -20        MS. PUJARI: You'll withdraw\nthe bullying, sir.",
  "MR. DENTON: Oh, fine. I'll\nwithdraw the question.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:\nQ.   Let's go back to page 91 of\nA.   Again, I don't take any issue\nwith what's written here as far as that\nmeeting and what was dis -4    Q.   Okay. Thank you.\nA.   -- what was written.\nQ.   All right. So at some point\nthere was a meeting between NS and its\ncontractors, SPSI and SRS, with the local\nfire chief, Chief Drabick, concerning the\nvent and burn. And I'm referring you to\npage 94 of 158.\nAre you with me?\nA.   I'm on page 94. If you could\npoint me to -15    Q.   Yeah, we'll go to the middle\nparagraph.\nA.   Okay.\nQ.   It says, \"According to the\nIC\" -- that's the incident command, which was\nChief Drabick, the fire chief of East\nPalestine -- \"the SPSI president and the SRS\nproject manager insisted that he only had\nminutes to decide whether to allow the\nvent and burn to proceed because they wanted\nto begin at 15:00 and before sunset to avoid\nPage 147 1 158. 2 \"Following that meeting, the 3 Oxy Vinyl Dallas team was not informed of 4 further temperature monitoring of data 5 collected, and at that point the NS and SPSI 6 did not direct any further questions or 7 provide any situation updates to the Oxy 8 Vinyls Dallas team.\" 9 That's exactly what I just 10 said, didn't I? 11 A. So following -- following that 12 meeting -- and I don't disagree with anything 13 that's written here. 14 Q. Okay. 15 A. If you could repeat the 16 question, though, because, again, we have two 17 different people, and you said \"following 18 that meeting.\" 19 What exact meeting, other than 20 this -- the meeting that we were referenced 21 on page 91? 22 Q. Right. 23 The one where he said, let's be 24 perfectly clear, they're not polymerizing. 25 That meeting.|Page 149 1 atmospheric temperature inversions and vapor 2 cloud to disperse.\" 3 Is that right? Is that what 4 happened, sir? 13 minutes? 5 A. I don't dispute what's written 6 here. 7 Q. Go down to the next paragraph. 8 \"The incident commander said that at no 9 point,\" at no point, \"did any official from 10 Oxy Vinyls have discussions with him or the 11 unified command. He said there was no 12 dissenting opinion provided to him about 13 polymerization.\" 14 Right? 15 A. Could you point out that on 16 page 94 where -- 17 Q. Yeah, I sure can. Let's go to 18 down to one, two, three -- fourth paragraph. 19 \"The IC told the investigators that at no 20 point did an official from Oxy Vinyls have 21 discussions with him.\" That's Chief Drabick. 22 \"He stated there were no dissenting opinion 23 provided to him about whether polymerization 24 was occurring within the tank cars.\" 25 Do you see that?|\nA.   I do see that.\nQ.   Well, there sure as heck was a\ndissenting opinion from Oxy Vinyls; it just\nwasn't shared with the chief, was it?\nA.   What's written here is the IC\ntold investigators that at no point did any\nofficial from Oxy Vinyl have discussions with\nthe IC or unified staff command.\nQ.   Right.\nSo what happened here, if we\nsummarize this, you go to Chief Drabick, you\ngive him 13 minutes. You don't give him the\ndissenting opinion from Oxy Vinyl, and you,\nyou\" being NS, say, is it okay if we blow up\nthese tank cars?\nMS.

I don't\ndispute what's written on this document.\nQ.   Okay. And then if we go down\nto the other part that's highlighted. \"At no\npoint did any official from Oxy Vinyls have\ndiscussions with the chief. He stated there\nwere no dissenting opinions as to whether\npolymerization was occurring within the tank\ncars.\"\nCorrect?\nThat's what it says. That's\nwhat happened.\nRight?\nMS. PUJARI: Objection.\nCompound.\nTHE WITNESS: That's what's\nwritten on the paper. And when I read\nthat, I think as anybody would read\nthat, that the entire incident team,\nhe had -- Chief Drabick himself had\nnot heard of any dissenting\nopinions -25\nthe track reopened, getting the cars out of\nthe way, right?\nMS. PUJARI: Objection.\nArgumentative.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:\nQ.   Right?\nA.   No, that is not a factor in a\nvent and burn.\nQ.   All right. Well, we'll test\nyou on that. How about -- no, not that one.\nI'm talking status reports.\nMS. PUJARI: Roger, I think\nthis is probably a good time to break\nfor lunch. It's 12:30.\nSound good?\nMR. DENTON: Sure. It's your\nwitness.\nHow long do you want to take?\nMS. PUJARI: 30.\nMR. DENTON: 30?\nMS. PUJARI: 30.\nVIDEOGRAPHER: 12:29, we are\noff the video record.\nOff the record at 12:29 p.m.)\nVIDEOGRAPHER: 1:05, we are on\nPage 155 1 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 2 Q. And the dissenting -- 3 A. -- concerning polymerization. 4 Q. And the dissenting opinion came 5 from the people that made it, Oxy Vinyls, who 6 said, don't blow up the cars. There's no 7 polymerization. 8 That was the dissenting opinion 9 that NS didn't want the chief to hear, right? 10 MS. PUJARI: Objection. 11 Compound. Misstates evidence. 12 THE WITNESS: Your question 13 concerning the decision and no 14 dissenting opinions -- 15 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 16 Q. Uh-huh. 17 A. -- the decision to vent and 18 burn was not solely based on whether or not 19 polymerization was occurring or not. That 20 wasn't the single point that was made. Is 21 polymerization occurring or not? Okay. 22 We'll do a vent and burn. That wasn't the 23 only factor involved here in the incident. 24 Q. Right. 25 The other factor was getting|Page 157 1 the video record. 2 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 3 Q. So, sir, I want to go to 4 paragraph 97 of the third-party complaint, 5 which is page 21. It's highlighted in yellow 6 there. 7 Do you have a copy of that, 8 sir? 9 A. I do. 10 Q. And it says -- Norfolk Southern 11 says in this pleading that \"At approximately 12 4:37 p.m. on February 6th, unified command 13 gave the green light to execute the vent and 14 burn, and the response team detonated the 15 controlled explosives of the five vinyl 16 chloride cars.\" 17 Do you see that? 18 A. I do see that. 19 Q. So basically if I'm 20 understanding this paragraph, help me if I'm 21 wrong, that on February 6th, at about 22 4:37 p.m., this is when the explosives went 23 off on the vinyl chloride cars and they were 24 burned. 25 Right?|\nA.   I agree that what's written\nthere is written there, that that's -3    Q.   Well, you're the corporate rep.\nIs that what happened? I'm just trying to\nestablish a time, really, a date and a time.\nA.   At 4:37 p.m.?\nQ.   Yeah.\nA.   The unified command provided a\nradio -- or provided by radio the official\ngreen light to execute the vent and burn.\nQ.   Let me ask you this, not\nwith -- keep the document, but not related to\nthe document.\nWere you involved in any way in\nresponding to this derailment when it took\nplace?\nA.   No, I was not.\nQ.   No involvement whatsoever?\nA.   No involvement.\nQ.   So your only involvement was\nbecause you were designated by the defendants\nhere to testify about these topics.\nCorrect?\nA.   I was designated by our law\ndepartment to represent Norfolk Southern.\nMS. PUJARI: Counsel, can I get\na copy?\nMR. DENTON: Oh, yes.\nMS. PUJARI: Thank you.\nMR. DENTON: Sorry about that.\nMS. PUJARI: No problem.\nTHE WITNESS: No, I don't\nbelieve I reviewed this document.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:\nQ.   Okay. Well, we'll do it now\nthen.\nLet's just look at the front\npage. It's the -- it says it's the \"Incident\nStatus Report, February 5th\" -- this was\nbefore the vent and burn. This is on\nSunday -- \"2023.\"\nAnd then if we go to page 2,\nit's an NS Incident Status Report.\nDo you see that?\nA.   Page 1 of 7?\nQ.   Yes, sir.\nA.   I see that.\nQ.   And it says right there at the\ntop, \"Status report dated 2/5/2023.\"\nDo you see that?\nPage 159 1 Q. Right. Okay. 2 And then if we go on to 3 paragraph 98 on that document, sir, again, 4 I'm just looking for time. It says, \"The 5 released vinyl chloride burned through the 6 night of February 6th.\" 7 Do you see that? 8 A. I see that. 9 Q. So that's Monday night. The 10 derailment happened on the 3rd, Friday, the 11 4th, Saturday, the 5th was Sunday. Vent and 12 burn, 4:37 in the afternoon, and then the 13 cars burned all night. 14 Do you see that? 15 A. I see that. 16 (Dixon 30(b)(6) Exhibit 14 17 marked for identification.) 18 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 19 Q. Okay. So I want to show you 20 Exhibit 14, which is, for the record, 21 NS-CA-001621933 {sic}. Again, a document 22 that was in the range I was informed that you 23 had available for your review. 24 Do you remember reviewing this 25 document, sir?|Page 161 1 A. Yes. 2 Q. Okay. And this is a document 3 where someone in the field or somewhere is 4 keeping track of what's going on as a 5 response to this derailment. 6 Correct? 7 A. Correct. 8 Q. Okay. Let's go to page 4 of 7. 9 So again, this is Sunday, 10 before the decision to vent and burn on 11 Monday. Look at that at the top, \"overall 12 site strategy and objectives.\" 13 Page 4 of 7, Michael. Right 14 there. There you go. Highlight that, 15 please. 16 Do you see that, sir? That's 17 what we're talking about. 18 A. I see that. 19 Q. The very first site objective 20 and strategy was \"Remediating track bed and 21 rebuild track.\" 22 Do you see that? 23 MS. PUJARI: Objection. 24 Mischaracterizes the document. 25 Misreads the document.|\nQUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:\nQ.   \"Sequencing of remediating\ntrack bed versus rebuild track.\"\nDid I read that correctly?\nA.   That's what's written here.\nQ.   \"Objectives re:\" -- r-e,\ncolon -- \"timeline for reopening the line and\nresuming traffic.\"\nDo you see that?\nA.   That's what's written here.\nQ.   So the objective was to get the\ntrack opened in the incident report, right?\nMS. PUJARI: Objection.\nMischaracterizes the document.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:\nQ.   Well, let me read it again.\nObjectives: Timeline for\nreopening line and resuming traffic.\"\nDid I read that correctly?\nMS. PUJARI: Objection.\nMischaracterizes the remainder of the",

  "A.   I agree. That's the -- that's\nthe date.\nQ.   Okay. And let's look at\nsomething else on page 3 of 7. Let's go\ndown. There's a box there with a yellow\nhighlighting across the top.\nAnd it says right there on\nFebruary 5, 2023, on Sunday, that NS is\nalready scheduling a, quote, \"Vent and burn\noperation for 2/6/23.\"\nThey already made up the\ndecision before they ever talked to Chief\nDrabick, didn't they?\nA.   I don't know what was\ncommunicated at -- to Chief Drabick or the\nincident command. And again, this is the\nfirst time I'm seeing this recovery plan\ndocument.\nQ.   Well, it was in the documents I\nwas told by the lawyers that was in the\npackage for you to review. That's number\none.\nAnd number two, it's an NS\ndocument, right?\nPage 163 1 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 2 Q. Right. 3 A. As the priority being 4 remediating track bed. 5 Q. But the objective, the next 6 line -- you see the title of this whole 7 section is \"Overall Site Strategy and 8 Objectives.\" 9 Right? 10 That's what this document is 11 for, right? 12 A. That is what's written here -- 13 Q. Okay. 14 A. -- on the document. 15 Q. And let's read it one more 16 time. 17 The objectives, \"Timeline for 18 reopening the line and resuming traffic.\" 19 Did I read that correctly? 20 A. That's what's written here. 21 Q. And that's February 5th. 22 That's Sunday, before there's ever a decision 23 to vent and burn. 24 Right? 25 I'll help you out. It's page 1|Page 165 1 A. That's what's on the header 2 here. 3 Q. Okay. And you don't have to 4 review it to understand what it means, quote, 5 \"Vent and burn operation scheduled for 6 2/6/23,\" end quote. 7 So whoever wrote this knew that 8 that was going to happen the day before, 9 regardless of the meeting with Chief Drabick, 10 right? 11 A. I can't say for certain that 12 that's exactly what they knew. 13 MS. PUJARI: Counsel, one point 14 of clarification on Exhibit 9 -- 15 MR. DENTON: No, no, no, no, 16 no. No, no, no, no, no. You're not 17 going to educate the witness with a 18 speaking objection. Not going to 19 happen. 20 MS. PUJARI: No, it's just to 21 you, and we can go off the record if 22 you'd like. Or we can step outside. 23 MR. DENTON: Well, let's get 24 the witness out of here. 25 MS. PUJARI: Well, you and I|\ncan just step out instead of -2        MR. DENTON: Okay.

It will be the second\namended notice.\nAnd counsel for Oxy Vinyls has\nagreed that the questions from Oxy\nVinyls will be constrained to the\nparagraphs identified in the second\namended notice. This is by agreement\nbecause Oxy Vinyls did not serve its\nown cross-notice of the 30(b)(6)\ndeposition.\nSo the paragraphs are going to\nbe limited to those on the second page\nof the second amended 30(b)(6) notice\nextent it calls for a legal\nconclusion.\nTHE WITNESS: I'm not -- I'm\nnot sure I can properly answer that,\nnot knowing exactly what's within that\nrange.\nQUESTIONS BY MS.

Calls 24 for speculation. 25 THE WITNESS: I'm not aware, as|Page 185 1 evidence that the vinyl chloride in the five 2 railcars was not properly stabilized? 3 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Vague 4 as to time. 5 THE WITNESS: Please repeat the 6 question. 7 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 8 Q. Sure. 9 As of today, sitting here, does 10 Norfolk Southern have any evidence that the 11 vinyl chloride in the five railcars was not 12 properly stabilized? 13 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Vague 14 as to time. 15 THE WITNESS: I don't -- I 16 don't know of any information that 17 tells us that, other than the vinyl 18 chloride was stabilized at the 19 point -- upon the point -- or the 20 point of us transporting those 21 railcars. 22 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 23 Q. What was the point of you 24 transporting the railcars? 25 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Vague.|\nTHE WITNESS: We were providing\na service for a shipper.\nQUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:\nQ.   Okay. Your testimony reads\nthat you don't have any information that the\nvinyl chloride was stabilized at the point of\ntransporting the railcars.\nSo I'm trying to understand\nwhat you're trying to say -10    A.   No, I said -- I was stating\nthat other than having information that tells\nus that the vinyl chloride -- that they came\non with their safety data sheets, and the\ninformation in the bill of lading tells us\nthis is vinyl chloride.\nQ.   Did it also tell you it was\nvinyl chloride stabilized?\nA.   All of our -- all of our\nemergency response guides indicate vinyl\nchloride stabilized as a product we haul.\nQ.   And was that the product that\nwas being hauled on February 3, 2023, as part\nof rail line 32N?\nA.   Yes, it was vinyl chloride.\nQ.   Vinyl chloride stabilized,\npapers that indicated it was vinyl chloride\nproperly stabilized at that point.\nQ.   In several paragraphs of the\nthird-party complaint, you reference several\ntreatises or manuals or handbooks that speak\nto the properties of vinyl chloride.\nCorrect?\nMS. PUJARI: Counsel, could you",
  "orient us to the paragraphs you're\nreferring to?\nMS. BROZ: Sure. 60, 64, 65,\nand 71.\nMS. PUJARI: Thank you.\nTHE WITNESS: Yes, we had a\nnumber -- a number of manuals or\nregulations that pertain to it.\nQUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:\nQ.   And I believe those manuals or\nregulations include Pamphlet 171, correct?\nA.   It does.\nQ.   Sittig's Handbook?\nA.   Can you state exactly which\ndocument you're referring to?\nQ.   Paragraph 60 of the complaint,\nSittig's Handbook. I don't know if I'm\nPage 187 1 correct? 2 A. Stabilized, yes. 3 Q. And do you have any evidence 4 whatsoever, as a representative of Norfolk 5 Southern, that the vinyl chloride was not 6 properly stabilized? 7 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Vague 8 as to time. 9 THE WITNESS: What I don't have 10 any concrete information on is whether 11 the vinyl chloride was stabilized 12 following the derailment. 13 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 14 Q. But as of the time of loading 15 it into the cars, it was stabilized properly. 16 Correct? 17 A. I assume it -- that's -- that 18 is something that I can't speak on behalf of 19 NS because I'm not sure when it was loaded, 20 at what point it was loaded. I know we 21 received it at TRRA in St. Louis. 22 Q. When you received it in TRRA in 23 St. Louis, it was properly stabilized, 24 correct? 25 A. Again, we were given shipping|Page 189 1 pronouncing it correctly. 2 A. Sittig's Handbook, yes. 3 Q. Oxy Vinyls vinyl chloride SDS? 4 A. Yes. 5 Q. Norfolk Southern emergency 6 safety guide for vinyl chloride? 7 A. Yes. 8 Q. US Department of 9 Transportation's emergency response 10 guidebook? 11 A. Yes. 12 Q. Of those five manuals -- we'll 13 call them manuals just for the sake of 14 reference. Of those five manuals we just 15 discussed, which of those did Norfolk 16 Southern rely upon in East Palestine after 17 the train derailment on April -- on 18 February 3, 2023? 19 A. I think Norfolk Southern 20 representatives there on the ground in East 21 Palestine relied on their knowledge of all of 22 those documents. Primarily, again, at the 23 initial incident, probably the safety data 24 sheet and the emergency response guide. 25 Q. Did Norfolk Southern rely upon|\nor review Pamphlet 171 when making the\ndecision to vent and burn the railcars on\nFebruary 6, 2023?\nA.   I can't speak to that, having\nnot been part of that team.\nQ.   And you are Norfolk Southern's\nrepresentative today, correct?\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   And that is an allegation that\nis made in paragraph 60 of the third amended\ncomplaint that you were asked to testify\nabout, correct?",
  "MS. PUJARI: Objection.\nMisstates the complaint.\nTHE WITNESS: Yeah, we're -16    we're -- the reference here to The\nChlorine Institute and Vinyl Institute\nPamphlet 171 is in combination to,\nagain, paragraph 60, which is\nreferencing the possibility of\npolymerization.\nQUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:\nQ.   Did Norfolk Southern rely upon\nthe information in Pamphlet 161 -- 171\nbetween February 3rd and February 6, 2023,\nQ.   Did the incident team refer\nor -- refer or rely on Pamphlet 161 {sic}\nwhen it made its decision to vent and burn\nthe five railcars? It's a simple question.\nMS. PUJARI: Objection. Asked",
  "and answered.\nTHE WITNESS: It may be a\nsimple question, but, again, it's\ninformation as a whole. That's why we\nhave specialists that go in and work\nlocally with local responders. That's\nwhy there's training on hazardous\nmaterial, to get as much information\nas they can through their experience\nand their knowledge.\nSo did -- was the vinyl\nchloride -- or The Chloride Institute\nand Vinyl Institute's Pamphlet 171 the\nonly thing that was utilized to make a\ndetermination? Then I would say it\nwas not the only document.\nQUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:\nQ.   Are you saying that they did\nutilize it, though, in making the\ndetermination?\nPage 191 1 when it made the decision to vent and burn 2 the five railcars? 3 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Asked 4 and answered. 5 THE WITNESS: Yeah, I don't 6 think, number one, the decision was 7 Norfolk Southern's to make, the 8 decision to vent and burn. 9 I think the incident commander 10 and the incident team made the 11 decision based on guidance from all 12 team members. 13 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 14 Q. Did the incident commander and 15 the incident team rely upon Pamphlet 171 when 16 it made the decision to vent and burn the 17 five railcars? 18 A. I think the incident team 19 utilized their knowledge, at least the 20 individuals familiar with HAZMAT utilized 21 their -- which is the team, used their 22 knowledge contained in both the Chlorine 23 Institute and Vinyl Institute, the ERG, the 24 safety data sheet as well as Norfolk 25 Southern's sheets with respect to chemicals.|Page 193 1 A. I'm telling you that I -- we 2 believe the information and the knowledge 3 presented within The Chlorine Institute and 4 Vinyl Institute Pamphlet 171 was information 5 that was known to responders and participants 6 on the team. 7 Q. Which responders was it known 8 to? 9 A. It would have been known to any 10 of our -- a number of our hazardous materials 11 specialists, the SPSI, the two contractors. 12 Norfolk Southern was more than likely 13 familiar with that. Again, our own Norfolk 14 Southern HAZMAT employees would be familiar 15 with the document. 16 Q. I understand they are familiar 17 with it, they may have read it at some point, 18 but did they rely on the information in the 19 document when they made the decision to vent 20 and burn the five railcars on February 6, 21 2023? 22 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Asked 23 and answered. 24 THE WITNESS: Again -- 25 MS. PUJARI: Several times now.|\nTHE WITNESS: Again, I do not\nbelieve that any one of these\ndocuments was the -- was a thing that\nwas solely relied upon.\nQUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:\nQ.   I'm not asking if it was any\none.\nI'm asking if it is one of the\ndocuments they relied upon.\nMS. PUJARI: Objection. Asked\nand answered.\nTHE WITNESS: And again, I\nthink the knowledge in those documents\nwas utilized in making a\ndetermination, assessing the situation\nand looking at all the possibilities.\nQUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:\nQ.   How about for Sittig's\nHandbook? Same answer?\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   Let's turn to paragraph 161 of\nthe third amended complaint.\nMS. PUJARI: Third complaint.\nMS. BROZ: What's that?\nMS. PUJARI: Third-party\nother basis to claim that polymerization can\naccelerate the risk of BLEVE by blocking\npressure relief devices other than the NTSB\nHazardous Materials Group Chair Factual\nReport?\nA.   I'm not aware of any other\ndocuments with respect to polymerization and\nblocking pressure release surface devices\noutside of the NTSB docket report and perhaps\nthe testimony in the hearings, the NTSB\nhearings.\nQ.   Let's go to paragraph 62. It\nsays, \"Though Oxy Vinyls is now discounting\nthe risk that stabilized vinyl chloride can\npolymerize due to heating alone, the chemical\ndata sheet that Oxy Vinyls provided to\nNorfolk Southern warns of the polymerization\nand explosion risk of vinyl chloride due to\nexcess heating.\"\nDid I read that correctly?\nA.   Yes, that's what's written.\nQ.   Okay. What chemical data sheet\nare you referring to in paragraph 62?\nA.   Oxy Vinyls' safety data sheet\nthat was provided.\nPage 195 1 complaint, right? 2 MS. BROZ: Yep. 3 MS. PUJARI: Okay. 4 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 5 Q. Let me try that again. Let's 6 turn to paragraph 61 of the third-party 7 complaint. 8 MR. DENTON: 61? 9 MS. BROZ: 61. 10 MS. PUJARI: Okay. You got it? 11 THE WITNESS: Uh-huh. 12 MS. PUJARI: 61. 13 THE WITNESS: Yeah, this is... 14 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 15 Q. What is the basis for the 16 statement in paragraph 61 that polymerization 17 can accelerate the risks BLEVE by blocking 18 pressure release devices? 19 A. I think I would need to review 20 the NTSB docket B, Exhibit 10, Hazardous 21 Materials Group Chair's Factual Report. 22 MS. PUJARI: I believe that's 23 been marked. 24 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 25 Q. Does Norfolk Southern have any|Page 197 1 Q. Who from Norfolk Southern 2 reviewed Oxy Vinyls' safety data sheet? 3 A. I don't know who, or everyone 4 at Norfolk Southern, that's reviewed Oxy 5 Vinyls' safety data sheet with respect to 6 vinyl chloride. 7 Q. Do you know who was on the 8 ground on February 3, 2023, that reviewed Oxy 9 Vinyls' safety data sheet? 10 A. No, I cannot attest to everyone 11 that had read the safety data sheet. 12 However, in any incident, that 13 is one of the very first things the 14 responders would pull, is the safety data 15 sheet. And corresponding to the lading of 16 the shipment. 17 Q. Can you attest to who from 18 Norfolk Southern reviewed the safety data 19 sheet? 20 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Asked 21 and answered. 22 THE WITNESS: Again, I can't 23 attest who all at Norfolk Southern had 24 read the safety data sheet. 25|\nQUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:\nQ.   What is the basis for your\nallegation that Oxy Vinyls is now discounting\nthe risk that stabilized vinyl chloride can\npolymerize?\nA.   I think if you look at the\nHazardous Materials Group Chair Factual\nReport and the NTSB investigative hearing\ntranscript, day 2 and day 1, there's -10 there's mention -- mention of Oxy Vinyls\ndiscounting the risk that stabilized vinyl\nchloride can polymerize due to heating alone.\nQ.   Any other basis for that\nstatement?\nA.   No. I think it's, again, a\ncombination of looking at the -- Oxy's vinyl\nchloride safety data sheet and, again, along\nwith the Hazardous Materials Group Chair\nFactual Report and the investigative hearing\ntranscripts, day 1, day 2.\nQ.   Before February -- between\nFebruary 3rd and February 6, 2023, did any\nOxy Vinyls representative tell Norfolk\nSouthern that stabilized vinyl chloride\ncannot polymerize by heating it alone?\nCorrect?\nMS. PUJARI: Objection.\nMischaracterizes the evidence, and\nvague as to time.\nTHE WITNESS: There was a\nstatement from Oxy Vinyl, again, not\nbeing able to determine or rule out\nthe possibility of polymerization.\nThere were statements also from other\nrepresentatives at Oxy Vinyl stating\nthat there was not a possibility.\nBut the safety data sheet that\nOxy Vinyl provided actually gave",
  "concern that regardless of people not\non the ground -- if looking at the\nsafety data sheet alone, there's still\na possibility, regardless of what's\nbeing relayed by different individuals\nat Oxy, that polymerization could\noccur.\nQUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:\nQ.   Why did you discount the\nrealtime advice provided by Oxy and instead\nrely upon the safety data sheet?\nMS. PUJARI: Objection.\nPage 199 1 A. I believe there was a 2 representative from vinyl oxy -- vinyl -- or, 3 I'm sorry, for Oxy Vinyls that had made that 4 statement. 5 Q. Between February 3rd and 6 February 6, 2023, did anyone from Oxy Vinyls 7 tell Norfolk Southern that stabilized vinyl 8 chloride can polymerize due to heating alone? 9 A. No, I don't believe that 10 anybody made that statement. However, there 11 was a possibility by the Oxy rep, the field 12 representative on the ground, that -- where 13 he stated that he couldn't discount the 14 possibility of polymerization. 15 Q. And what date was that 16 statement made? 17 A. It was early in the response, 18 and I'd have to go back and look at the 19 transcripts. 20 Q. And as time passed, was that 21 statement ever made again? 22 A. I'm not aware of that statement 23 being made again. 24 Q. In fact, the opposite was said 25 after the initial statement was made.|Page 201 1 Mischaracterizes prior testimony. 2 THE WITNESS: I can't attest to 3 why or what -- somebody ruled 4 something completely out. 5 I can tell you that individuals 6 looking at the safety data sheets, 7 looking at the situation on the 8 ground, again, looking at the -- you 9 know, their knowledge of vinyl 10 chloride, that there were other things 11 on the ground outside of 12 polymerization that they were looking 13 at. 14 With respect to polymerization, 15 again, the safety data sheet says 16 vinyl chloride stabilized. However, 17 throughout the safety data sheet, 18 there are sections in there 19 corresponding to firefighting, 20 which -- corresponding to dangers and 21 hazards throughout -- storage, for 22 example. Throughout the entire safety 23 data sheet, it states, do not expose 24 to heat, extremely flammable, can 25 violently pol -- I don't want to get|\nthe name messed up. Polymerization\ncan occur.\nThat is why, when somebody is\nlooking at that safety data sheet,\nthey're assuming this is something\nwe've got to be concerned with. These\ncars are in pool fires. They're being\nheated.\nIf Oxy Vinyls is saying that\nyou can't -- there can't be any\npotential for polymerization, then the\nsafety data sheet, again, as far as\nstorage, it says for vinyl chloride\nstore in a cool, dry place.",
  "And underneath it it says\nwithin -- on the safety data sheet\nthat if it's not stored correctly, it\ncan polymerize.\nAnd that follows right after,\nif not stabilized and/or stored\ncorrectly.\nQUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:\nQ.   Now, could you answer my\nquestion?\nWhy did Norfolk Southern\ninclude the SDS, which is the very\nfirst thing all the responders, I\nthink, look towards, that and the\nemergency response guide, to make\ntheir decisions.\nQUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:\nQ.   Let's turn to paragraph 64,\nwhich discusses the SDS.\nDid anyone from Norfolk\nSouthern ask vinyl -- Oxy -- let me try it\nagain.\nDid anyone from Norfolk\nSouthern ask anyone from Oxy Vinyls about the\ninformation contained in the SDS?\nA.   I'm not -- I'm not aware of any\nconversations, again, outside of the -17 again, if we're talking about a time frame of\nbetween the derailment -- that occurred\nfollowing the derailment -20    Q.   Between February -- we can\nclarify the time frame, if you'd like.\nBetween February 3rd and\nFebruary 6, 2023, did anyone from Norfolk\nSouthern ask Oxy Vinyls about the information\nthat was contained in the vinyl chloride SDS?\nPage 203 1 discount the real-time advice provided by Oxy 2 Vinyls and instead rely upon the SDS? 3 MS. PUJARI: Objection. 4 Misstates prior testimony, facts in 5 evidence. Asked and answered. 6 THE WITNESS: Yeah, it's the 7 same -- the same response I just got. 8 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 9 Q. Would you please answer my 10 question? 11 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Asked 12 and answered. 13 THE WITNESS: Repeat the 14 question. 15 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 16 Q. Why did Norfolk Southern 17 discount the real-time advice provided by Oxy 18 Vinyls and instead rely upon the SDS? 19 MS. PUJARI: Objection. 20 Misstates prior testimony. Asked and 21 answered. 22 THE WITNESS: Again, I don't 23 think anything was discounted. I 24 think they were looking at all the 25 information they had at hand to|Page 205 1 A. I can't attest to any 2 communications on the ground, but, again, Oxy 3 Vinyl had a representative there on the 4 ground in East Palestine communicating with 5 the incident response team. 6 MS. BROZ: Can we go off the 7 record a second? 8 VIDEOGRAPHER: Stand by. 2:13, 9 we are off the video record. 10 (Off the record at 2:13 p.m.) 11 VIDEOGRAPHER: 2:13, we are on 12 the video record. 13 (Dixon 30(b)(6) Exhibit 20 14 marked for identification.) 15 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 16 Q. Mr. Dixon, we have just handed 17 you what's been marked as Deposition 18 Exhibit 20. 19 Can you identify this document 20 for me? 21 A. This is Oxy Vinyls' safety data 22 sheet for vinyl chloride monomer. 23 Q. Can you turn to Section 10 of 24 this, please? 25 A. Yes.|\nQ.   Are you at Section 10?\nA.   I am.\nQ.   Where it says \"Stability and\nReactivity\"?\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   Do you see where it says\nChemical Stability\"?\nA.   I do.\nQ.   And it says, \"Generally stable\nat normal temperatures and pressures;\nhowever, may violently polymerize or generate\nother hazardous conditions when not\nstabilized and/or stored correctly.\"\nDo you see that?\nA.   I do.\nQ.   Did Norfolk Southern take this\nstatement into account when it was\ndetermining whether or not the vinyl chloride\nwas polymerizing?\nA.   I believe they did.\nQ.   And it says, \"Will not\npolymerize when it's stabilized.\"\nCorrect?\nA.   It says, \"When not stabilized\nand/or stored correctly.\"\nA.   I believe that's the date, yes.\nQ.   And all of the documents that\nyou just referenced as being the source for\nthis emergency safety guide were published\nafter 2006.\nCorrect?\nA.   I don't know the response to\nthat off the hand. I'd have to look at each\none independently.\nI can tell you the emergency\nresponse guide was definitely last updated in\nI can't speak to the others as far as\nthe dates.\nQ.   So at the time of the East\nPalestine derailment, were you relying upon\nthe 2006 guide or the 2020 guide when making\nthe decisions of whether to vent and burn the\nvinyl chloride cars?\nA.   Again, the guides themselves\nare not just taken once -- one over another.\nThey're looking at all of the information at\nhand to make a determination.\nSo Norfolk Southern's emergency\nsafety guide would not have been the\ndriving -- let's say, driving force of all\nPage 207 1 Q. And I believe you testified 2 earlier today that the tank cars were not 3 breached upon the derailment. 4 Correct? 5 A. I believe that -- that's what 6 I stated earlier, yes. 7 Q. Let's turn to -- again, 8 apologize for jumping around here -- 9 paragraph 69 of the complaint. 10 You see in paragraph 69 it 11 references the emergency safety guide? 12 A. Yes. 13 Q. What is the source of the 14 information that is contained in Norfolk 15 Southern's emergency safety guide? 16 A. It is a -- information similar 17 to what's captured in both the vinyl chloride 18 pamphlet that we had referenced before. A 19 lot of the similar information from the 20 safety data sheet, similar to information 21 captured on the emergency response guide from 22 the DOT and PHMSA. 23 Q. And Norfolk Southern's 24 emergency safety guide was published in 25 September of 2006, correct?|Page 209 1 the documents to make a decision as far as 2 the handling. 3 Q. I understand you're 4 anticipating my questions, but I want you to 5 answer the question I asked. 6 Did you rely upon the 2006 7 guide or the 2020 guide when making the 8 decision to vent and burn the vinyl chloride 9 cars? 10 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Asked 11 and answered. 12 THE WITNESS: Again, I'm not 13 claiming that we relied solely on this 14 guide to make a decision, whether it's 15 the 2020 or not. 16 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 17 Q. I'm not saying solely. Which 18 one did you rely upon, the 2006 guide or the 19 2020 guide? 20 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Asked 21 and answered. 22 THE WITNESS: Incident command 23 and the incident responders would have 24 been looking at the 2020 emergency 25 response guide. They would have been|\nlooking at the safety data sheet.\nThey would have been looking at any\nother information that was provided at\nthat time on vinyl chloride.\nQUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:\nQ.   You just testified that Norfolk\nSouthern would have been looking at other\ninformation that was provided at the time\nabout vinyl chloride.\nCorrect?\nA.   They would have been looking at\nall the information they had at hand to\ndetermine what's the best actions to take\nhere. What are we dealing with to determine\nwhat are the risks and the exposures\nassociated with vinyl chloride.\nQ.   But that did not include the\ndirectives from Oxy Vinyls about whether the\nvinyl chloride was polymerizing.\nCorrect?\nMS. PUJARI: Objection.\nMischaracterizes prior testimony.\nTHE WITNESS: As I had stated\nbefore, I don't think any of the\nguidance that was provided or any of\nwithin the railcars that were unknown. Those",
  "were a few.\nQ.   What were the others?\nA.   Again, I wasn't a part of the\nincident command, and I don't have all the\ninformation pertaining to what was\nconsidered. But those were two.\nQ.   The potential of polymerization\nand the pressure within the railcars,\ncorrect?\nA.   And again, the fires\nassociated -- associated with them, the heat.\nThe fact that I don't believe anybody would\nargue that these cars were not stored\nproperly.\nQ.   So we have polymerization,\npressure, fires and heat.\nWhat were the other risks?\nA.   Chemicals that had been\nreleased. I mean, if you're talking about\nwhat are the other risks, can you clarify?\nAre you referring to risks\nassociated to...\nQ.   What factors did Norfolk\nSouthern take into account when deciding to\nPage 211 1 the information that was provided was 2 just discounted. 3 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 4 Q. But you did vent and burn the 5 five railcars containing vinyl chloride, 6 despite Oxy Vinyls' recommendation. 7 Correct? 8 MS. PUJARI: Objection. 9 Misstates the evidence. 10 THE WITNESS: The decision -- 11 the decision was not based solely, to 12 start with, on polymerization. The 13 decision took -- 14 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 15 Q. What was it based on? 16 MS. PUJARI: Could you let the 17 witness finish? 18 THE WITNESS: The consideration 19 was taking into account all risks 20 associated at the derailment site at 21 that time, polymerization being one, 22 potential polymerization being one. 23 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 24 Q. What were the other risks? 25 A. The pressure -- the pressures|Page 213 1 vent and burn the five cars containing vinyl 2 chloride? 3 A. They were looking, again, at 4 what is the safest course of action here; 5 looking at the possibility that we had cars 6 with unknown pressures; didn't have a lot of 7 comfort in temperatures at those -- at that 8 point; knowing that we have, again, 9 conflicting statements throughout the time on 10 polymerization; knowing the safety data sheet 11 says, look, stabilized vinyl chloride will 12 not pol -- there's not a risk there with 13 polymerization; however, it also states if 14 not properly stored, it can polymerize. 15 There was a lot of factors that 16 everyone as part of that response team was 17 looking at to make a determination as to what 18 do we do in order to mitigate the risks. 19 What's the best course of action. 20 Q. And you said the pressures were 21 not known in the railcars. 22 Is that correct? 23 A. My understanding, there was a 24 point where they were trying to get 25 measurements of the pressures of the|\nrailcars. And due to the fact that a lot of\nthe pressure relief valve -- valves -- I\nmean, pressure release devices and valves\nwere damaged and the pressure relief\nvalves -- or pressure relief devices were no\nlonger activating, that there really wasn't\nan easy way at that point in time to gauge\nthe pressure within the tanks.\nQ.   Can you turn back to what we\npreviously marked as Exhibit 13?\nMS. BROZ: Can we go off the\nrecord a second?",

Correct. 16 Q. So at least in one of the tank 17 cars, pressure was not an issue; is that 18 correct? 19 A. At that point in time, I would 20 say that's correct. 21 Q. And you also said that one of 22 the other factors that led to the decision to 23 vent and burn was the temperatures. 24 Correct? 25 A. Correct.|Page 217 1 temperature reading on any of the five tank 2 cars according to Deposition Exhibit 21? 3 MS. PUJARI: Objection.

BROZ: 14 Q. What was the highest 15 temperature reading ever taken? 16 A. From these pictures, it appears 17 6 5 . 18 Q. Did any of the temperature 19 readings for any of the tank cars go up 20 during the course of the temperature readings 21 between February 3rd and February 6, 2023? 22 A. I believe the answer is -- to 23 my recollection is, yes, there was a 24 temperature that went up. 25 Q. Okay. Which one?|\nA.   I'm going to have to look at -2 I think it was provided in the documents\nshowing all the temperatures gauges in the\ngraph associated with -5    Q.   Okay. Why don't we go ahead\nand mark that.\nMS. PUJARI: Wasn't it marked\nalready 22?\nMS. BROZ: Yes, Exhibit 22.\nQUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:\nQ.   Can you look at Exhibit 22 and\nlet me know if that's what you're thinking\nof?\nA.   Yes, this is what I was\nthinking of.\nQ.   Okay. So this is from tank car\nOCPX80370.\nCorrect?\nA.   Yes. Correct.\nQ.   And you're referring to the\nspike where the temperature went up to\ndegrees.\nCorrect?\nA.   Yeah. Not only that spike, but\nthe rise to 130, the increase. I mean, there\nbased off this graph that -- and the answer\nis, yes, that it decreased by that amount.\nQ.   And does the NAB temperature\nreadings in Deposition Exhibit 21 contradict\nthe graph?\nA.   I'm not quite sure what car -7 this is car OCPX80370, which is Car 53.\nQ.   It appears to be car -9        MS. PUJARI: Objection. Lack",

After that spike at 4 138 degrees, the temperature in OCPX80370 5 went down, correct? 6 MS. PUJARI: Objection. 7 Misstates the evidence. 8 THE WITNESS: It looks like 9 there was a change in temperature 10 between 1 a.m. and around 9 a.m., a 11 drop, not as significantly -- not as 12 significant as the drop between -- in 13 the evening between 6 and 8, I guess. 14 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 15 Q. And from the peak of 16 138 degrees till the temperature -- wait, 17 just start that again. 18 From the peak of 138 degrees 19 till the time of the vent and burn, the 20 temperature decreased by 12 degrees 21 Fahrenheit. 22 Correct? 23 A. That's correct. 24 Based on this -- I do want to 25 qualify that statement, though. It's just|Page 221 1 \"On March 20th\"? 2 A. I see that. 3 Q. Do you see the second sentence 4 says, \"The Oxy Vinyls technical manager at 5 its La Porte, Texas facility told NTSB 6 investigators that based upon the analyses, 7 it concluded that no PVC was present in any 8 of the railcar samples\"? 9 A. I see that that's written here, 10 yes. 11 Q. Let's now go to page 63 of 158. 12 You see this refers to Car 29, 13 OCPX80235? 14 A. Yes, I see that. 15 Q. You see the last sentence on 16 the page is, \"There is no evidence of polymer 17 or other contaminants within the spring guide 18 tube or other components\"? 19 A. I see where that's written, 20 yes. 21 Q. Okay. Let's go to page 65 of 22 158. And we'll go to the last para -- 23 paragraph on the page, Car 30, OCPX80179. 24 Second to last sentence on the 25 page, \"Other than a thick layer of the|\nsoot/carbon coating, the PRD teardown found\nno evidence of polymer or other contaminants\nwithin the spring guide tube or other\ncomponents.\"",

But again, 18 I think -- I don't believe that 19 everything's been finalized with 20 respect to the investigation. 21 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 22 Q. So Norfolk Southern has no 23 evidence that polymer was found on any of the 24 vinyl chloride railcars at this time, 25 correct?|Page 225 1 Q. And you understand that you're 2 not speaking on behalf of yourself; you're 3 speaking on behalf of the company. 4 Correct? 5 A. I understand that. 6 Q. Okay. Now, today when I talk 7 about GATX and General American Marks 8 Company, is it okay if I refer to them 9 collectively as GATX? 10 A. Yes. 11 Q. Okay. So when I ask you 12 questions and I say \"GATX,\" just keep in mind 13 I'm talking about both of them. 14 Okay? Fair enough? 15 A. Okay. 16 Q. All right. Now, you've been 17 talking this afternoon and the latter part of 18 this morning about the decision to vent and 19 b u r n . 20 C o r r e c t ? 21 A. I've been asked about questions 22 concerning vent and burn. 23 Q. Right. 24 And you've been answering 25 questions about vent and burn.|\nC o r r e c t ?\nA.   Correct.\nQ.

That's correct.\nQ.   And I've gone through this, and\nI want you to correct me if I'm wrong, but I\nthink in all of these documents that are on\nhere, there's only a single Norfolk Southern\ndocument that you reviewed in order to\ntestify here today.\nIs that accurate?\nA.   No, that's not accurate. As I\nstated earlier, I did look at Norfolk\nSouthern's operating rules, and I did look at\nNorfolk Southern's NS-1 rules with respect to\nequipment handling.\nQ.   Okay. Fair enough.\nWith the exception of those\nthree documents or groups of documents, the\nannual report, the Norfolk Southern operating\nrules and Norfolk Southern NS-1 rules, you",
  "Page 227 1 C o r r e c t ? 2 A. I understand that to be 3 c o r r e c t . 4 Q. Okay.

Now, I want to focus on 11 things that Norfolk Southern claims my client 12 did have involvement in. 13 Fair enough? 14 A. That's fine. 15 Q. Okay. Now, you started today 16 by telling us what information you had 17 reviewed in order to prepare to testify here 18 concerning the allegations that Norfolk 19 Southern has made concerning my client, 20 concerning Oxy Vinyls and concerning Trinity 21 in the third-party action that Norfolk 22 Southern filed. 23 Correct? 24 A. Correct. 25 Q. And I want to make sure I|Page 229 1 did not review any other NS documents. 2 Is that correct? 3 A. I believe there was also an NS 4 safety data sheet concerning -- and I refer 5 to it as a safety data sheet. It's not. 6 It's a sheet concerning vinyl chloride -- 7 Q. Okay. 8 A. -- for our HAZMAT team. 9 Q. Any other NS documents that 10 you've reviewed in order to testify here 11 today? 12 A. No. 13 Q. Okay. So if what's been told 14 to us is accurate, NS has reviewed over 15 1.8 million pieces of paper, pages, in 16 connection with this litigation, and the sum 17 and substance of everything you've looked at 18 is what you just identified. 19 Is that correct? 20 From NS's documents, to be 21 accurate. 22 MS.

  "there -- is there something above\nserious? Is there something below\nserious?\nPage 231 1 A. I'm with you. 2 Q. From all of NS's documents. 3 In order to prepare to testify 4 here today as to the bases of the claims that 5 are asserted in the third-party complaint for 6 these particular paragraphs, you have told us 7 everything you've reviewed from NS. 8 Is that correct? 9 A. That's correct. 10 Q. Okay. Now, you understand that 11 NS has made some very serious allegations 12 concerning my client, GATX. 13 Correct? 14 A. I understand the allegations in 15 the complaint, correct. 16 Q. And you agree with me that 17 those are serious allegations arising from a 18 very serious incident. 19 Correct? 20 A. I would assume any allegations 21 in a complaint would be considered -- I mean, 22 I don't know how you categorize them, what -- 23 is there anything in here that's not serious? 24 I'm not quite sure. 25 Q. Okay. But you would agree with|Page 233 1 I would say that it's been 2 asserted, and -- 3 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS: 4 Q. Okay. 5 A. -- that's what I would say. 6 Q. All right. So you can't tell 7 me if it's serious. 8 Can you tell me, though, 9 whether it's important to be accurate in 10 terms of what has been alleged against GATX? 11 You understand what \"accurate\" 12 means, correct? 13 A. Yes, I understand what 14 \"accurate\" means, and I would say that, yes, 15 it's important to be accurate. 16 Q. And you agree with me that if 17 you're going to rely on the NTSB, you 18 shouldn't cherry-pick some statements that 19 the NTSB said and ignore other relevant 20 statements of the NTSB on that particular 21 subject. 22 Correct? 23 A. I would say that you -- your 24 question, if I understood it correctly, was 25 you shouldn't ignore, nor anything in the|\nNTSB hearings?\nQ.   Well, you relied on the NTSB\npretty extensively, as reflected in\nExhibit 1.\nCorrect?\nA.   Correct.\nQ.   And you relied on the hearings\nthat the NTSB held on June 22nd and June 23rd\nof 2023.\nCorrect?\nA.   Yeah, we relied on the\ninvestigation -13    Q.   Right.\nA.   -- of the incident -15    Q.   And you relied on -16    A.   -- to some degree.\nQ.   Sorry.\nYou relied on some reports that\nthe NTSB prepared, like the Mechanical Group\nFactual Report.\nCorrect?\nA.   That's correct.\nQ.   And it's important to not\ncherry-pick just favorable statements from\nthose hearings or that report if you're\ny e s .\nQ.   And the \"a qualified mechanical\ninspector\" does not identify who that\nqualified mechanical inspector works for,\ndoes it?\nA.   No, it doesn't.\nQ.   But it does say that such a",
  "qualified mechanical inspection was, in fact,\nconducted on February 1st in Madison,\nI l l i n o i s .\nC o r r e c t ?\nA.   Correct.\nQ.   And so you would expect that\nthere would be some evidence that that\nmechanical inspection took place.\nCorrect?\nA.   Yes. As stated here, a\nqualified mechanical inspector conducted a\nmechanical inspection and air brake test.\nQ.   All right. And if I heard you\ncorrectly this morning, what you were telling\nMr. Denton was, it's your understanding,\nbased on the NTSB hearings, that that\nqualified mechanical inspection -- inspector\nwas a TRRA employee.\nPage 235 1 trying to depict a truthful statement. 2 Correct? 3 A. I believe that's correct -- 4 Q. Okay. 5 A. -- you shouldn't. 6 Q. You shouldn't. 7 You should be truthful, and you 8 should be accurate, correct? 9 A. That's correct. 10 Q. All right. So let's go then to 11 paragraph 29 of the complaint. And I promise 12 I'm going to try to not repeat what was 13 covered already this morning, but we need to 14 sort of set the stage, if you will. 15 Paragraph 29 was the one 16 Mr. Denton spent quite a bit of time with you 17 on this morning, and that is the paragraph 18 that says that \"The train was assembled in 19 Madison, Illinois, and was destined for 20 Conway, Pennsylvania. That on February 1, 21 2023, a qualified mechanical inspector 22 conducted a mechanical inspection and air 23 brake test.\" 24 That's what's alleged, correct? 25 A. That's what's written here,|Page 237 1 Is that correct? 2 A. That was my understanding, 3 c o r r e c t . 4 Q. Okay. So you would agree with 5 me that in paragraph 29, you were not talking 6 about an NS, Norfolk Southern, qualified 7 mechanical inspector having conducted such an 8 inspection on February 1st of 2023. 9 C o r r e c t ? 10 A. I think what's stated here is 11 that a qualified mechanical inspector 12 conducted a mechanical inspection and air 13 t e s t . 14 When I questioned earlier about 15 who, I believe, had performed that test, my 16 reply was, an employee working for the TRRA. 17 Q. So it should be pretty easy to 18 answer my question, that you were not talking 19 about an NS-qualified mechanical inspector, 20 correct? In paragraph 29. 21 A. In paragraph 29, it's not 22 distinguishing whether it was a TRRA or a 23 Norfolk Southern employee. 24 Q. Right. 25 A. It reads verbatim, \"A qualified|\nmechanical inspector conducted a mechanical\ninspection and air brake test.\"\nQ.   Right.\nWhich is why you, Norfolk\nSouthern, I'm asking you, in paragraph 29,\nsince it doesn't distinguish, is it referring\nto an NS-qualified mechanical inspector; yes\nor no?\nA.   I believe the answer is no.\nQ.   Thank you.\nNow, will you agree with me\nthat if NS performed an inspection pursuant\nto the CFR that you talked about this morning\nwith Mr. Denton, that you would expect,\npursuant to NS's policies, that there would\nbe some record of NS having -- thank you -17 having conducted such an inspection?\nC o r r e c t ?\nA.   If Norfolk Southern was\ninspecting a railcar at a Norfolk Southern\nyard, whether inbound inspection or outbound\ninspection, we would have a record of the\ninspection taking place.\nQ.   It's a good business practice\nto have a written record if you're going to\nto the NS crew that, again, the brakes are in\ngood -- good shape, no issues found.\nTRRA would be, again,\nresponsible for the inbound inspection,\noutbound inspection, of those railcars.\nThat is something, again, if when we provide\nan interchange, the inbound or the outbound\ncrew is not going through and looking at\nindividual inspections on every car.\nQ.   Okay. So let me understand.\nIf TRRA performed that\ninspection, if TRRA performed that\ninspection, NS would not expect to see any\nwritten documentation of such an inspection.\nIs that correct?\nA.   The train crew receiving that\ntrain, or getting on the train, would not be\nlooking for any documentation of every single\nmechanical inspection.\nQ.   Okay. Would the train crew be\nlooking for any documentation that anything\nbeyond a brake test had been performed as\npart of this qualified mechanical inspection\nthat is to be done pursuant to Part 215,\nrailroad freedom -- I'm sorry, Railroad\nPage 239 1 conduct a qualified mechanical inspection. 2 C o r r e c t ? 3 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Beyond 4 the scope of the 30(b)(6) topics. 5 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS: 6 Q. You can answer. 7 A. I think Norfolk Southern feels 8 it is a good practice. 9 Q. Thank you. 10 Now, if Norfolk Southern is 11 going to rely on a mechanical inspection 12 performed by TRRA, would you agree with me 13 it's a good business practice for Norfolk 14 Southern to get some written proof that that 15 has been done by TRRA? Correct? 16 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Beyond 17 the scope of the 30(b)(6). 18 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS: 19 Q. You can answer. 20 A. No, not in an interchange. 21 That's not something that you would typically 22 see. You would have a brake slip, a Class I 23 brake slip, on that car, or on that train, as 24 the crew took it from Madison en route to 25 Decatur. And that brake slip would certify|Page 241 1 Freight Car and Safety Standards? 2 MS. PUJARI: Objection. 3 Compound question and combines two 4 different concepts. So, compound. 5 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS: 6 Q. You can answer. 7 A. The outbound train crew would 8 require to get the Class I brake test. 9 They're not going to, like I said before, ask 10 and review mechanical inspection criteria on 11 every car. 12 Q. So is it your testimony on 13 behalf of NS that in order to satisfy 14 Part 215, Railroad Freight Car Safety 15 Standards, and specifically Section 215.13 -- 16 A. Can you tell me what exhibit -- 17 Q. Sure, I'm sorry. That was 18 Exhibit 4 this morning. 19 It's right there, on top of 20 your hand. 21 A. Okay. This is Exhibit 5. 22 Q. Okay. Exhibit 5. Sorry, there 23 seems to have been a misnumbering. 24 But is that stan -- Part 215? 25 A. Yes, this is Part 215.|\nQ.   Okay. And recall you discussed",

Now, let's look at\nexhibit -- I think it was -- I'm not sure\nwhat number it was, actually. It's from the\nNTSB. It's titled \"Safety Systems Human\nPerformance Group Chair's Factual Report.\"\nA.   What document?\nQ.   8.\nYou with me?\nA.   I have the document.\nQ.   It's Exhibit 8. And again,\nthis is one of the documents you looked at\nthis morning with Mr. Denton.\nC o r r e c t ?\nA.   It is.\nQ.   This is not one of the\nPage 243 1 to satisfy 215.13, that NS can rely on TRRA 2 and rely on no written documentation of any 3 such inspection having been conducted? 4 MS. PUJARI: Objection to the 5 extent it calls for a legal conclusion 6 and goes beyond 215.13, sub A. 7 THE WITNESS: Yeah. Please 8 re -- please repeat the question. 9 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS: 10 Q. Sure. 11 You understand that Section 215 12 applies to railroads, correct? 13 A. Yes. 14 Q. It applies to NS, correct? 15 A. It applies to all railways -- 16 Q. But here we're talking about NS 17 in this incident, so I'm asking you about NS. 18 Does 215 apply to NS in 19 connection with the East Palestine derailment 20 that occurred on February 3rd of 2023? 21 A. Predeparture inspection, again, 22 as it reads in the first bullet, at each 23 location -- 24 Q. No, Mr. Dixon, respectfully, I 25 have limited time. Very simple question.|Page 245 1 documents that you relied on, though, in 2 connection with preparing to testify here 3 today. 4 Correct? 5 A. It is not something I reviewed. 6 Q. Okay. So I would like to turn 7 your attention, first of all, to page 5, 8 which you already looked at. 9 Under February 1st, the 10 Madison, Illinois, TRRA yard. And we saw 11 where it says that the train crew conducted 12 predeparture and mechanical inspection of 13 Train 32N. 14 Do you understand what a train 15 crew is in connection with this incident? 16 A. No, I'm not -- I'm not familiar 17 there in Madison, the TRRA yard, what exactly 18 they're stating by train crew conductor. 19 Q. Do you understand the terminal 20 exchange to have a train crew? 21 A. I'm sorry. The question is, do 22 I understand a terminal exchange -- 23 Q. Right. 24 A. -- to have a train crew? 25 Q. Do you think that TRRA train|\ncrew there -- do you see where it says,\nEngineer and conductor on duty\"? Do you see\ntwo bullets up?\nIt's right there, in the\ninterest of time.\nA.   Yeah, I see that.\nQ.   Okay. So first it says they're\na train crew. It defines them. Engineer and\nconductor on duty.\nDo you see that?\nA.   I see that.\nQ.   And then just two bullets on -13 then it says, \"TRRA employees completed a\nClass I air brake test.\"\nCorrect?\nA.   Correct.\nQ.   And then it goes back to \"Train\ncrew conducted predeparture/mechanical\ninspection of Train 32N.\"\nDo you see that?\nA.   I see what's written there.\nQ.   But you don't know whether that\ntrain crew is the engineer and conductor of\nNorfolk Southern, correct?\nA.   I don't know.\nrailcars, to maintain railcars, and to do\ncertain repairs of railcars.\nQ.   Are they Norfolk Southern\ne m p l o y e e s ?\nA.   Norfolk Southern has carmen,\nbut these employees -- I'm not sure what this\nis a reference to. Again, I didn't see this\ndocument, but carmen in general, as I stated,\nthey repair, they maintain, and they inspect\nrailcars for repair.\nQ.   That's what they should do,\nc o r r e c t ?\nThey should repair -14    A.   That's what -15    Q.   -- they should maintain, and\nthey should inspect railcars for repair.\nC o r r e c t ?\nA.   That's what they're -19    Q.   Right.\nA.   That's what their job is.\nQ.   Okay. So the NTSB here in its\nreport, referring to section CFR part 215.13,\nthe one I asked you about, says, \"At each\nlocation where freight railcar is placed on a\ntrain, the freight car shall be inspected\nPage 247 1 Q. Okay. 2 A. Again, a train crew would do 3 a -- their own inspection. The engineer 4 would inspect the locomotives that they're 5 taking -- they're getting on. They would do 6 a quick inspection. 7 But again, the train crew here 8 that -- 9 Q. So it's -- 10 A. I know it's written there. 11 Q. Okay. Let's turn to page 12. 12 See if we can help out with figuring out who 13 the train crew is and who purportedly did the 14 predeparture inspection. 15 3.2. Do you see where it says 16 \"Carmen Duties\"? Do you see that? 17 A. Yes. 18 Q. Do you have an understanding of 19 who carmen are in connection with a 20 predeparture inspection? 21 A. Yes, I do. 22 Q. Who are they? 23 A. Carmen is just that, the car -- 24 railroad carmen. They're employees that are 25 qualified to -- excuse me, to inspect|Page 249 1 before the train departs. The inspection can 2 be made before or after the car is placed on 3 the train.\" 4 And then it goes on to say that 5 there are at least 90 points of inspection in 6 a railcar. 7 Does NS agree with that? 8 A. I would agree. 9 Q. It goes on then to say that the 10 carman must thoroughly inspect, maintain and 11 repair railcar parts such as gaskets, air 12 hoses, loading restraining equipments and 13 tie-down devices. 14 Do you agree with that? 15 A. Yes. 16 Q. Okay. 17 A. That's a short list of repair 18 car parts, but -- 19 Q. Okay. Let's go to the next 20 p a g e . 21 MS. PUJARI: I'm sorry, can 22 Mr. Dixon finish his answers? 23 THE WITNESS: Yeah. It looks 24 like, again, there -- \"carman must 25 thoroughly inspect, maintain rail\" --|\nor \"repair railcar parts such as...\"\nAnd again, I just wanted to\npoint out in reading that, it's a very\nshort list -5 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS:\nQ.   Right. But let's go to the\nnext page and see what else is on there.\nIt then goes on to say, \"The\ncar inspectors also conduct visual\ninspections for leaky bearings or damaged\nc o m p o n e n t s . \"\nDoes NS agree with that?\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   \"If they see grease around the\nbearing seals, they'll get their gauge and\nslightly pry it to see if it's loose.\"\nDoes NS agree with that?\nA.   I can't speak to our carman's\nwork with respect to when -- when they're\ninspecting a car, I know they're looking. I\ndon't discount what was -- what was said, or\nI don't have any issue with what was noted on\nthe previous page, 3.2, but I can't speak to\nwhat their steps would be if they identified,\nlet's say, excessive leaks.\nA.   I'm not, again, aware of TRRA's\nwork. I would assume that, again, they were\nperforming either an inbound inspection or an\noutbound inspection of all railcars that come\nin and out of TRRA.\nQ.   So the basis for saying that a\nmechanical inspection was done, predeparture\ninspection, with respect to GPLX76545, was it\nbased on anything more than an assumption\nthat that work had been done?\nMS. PUJARI: Objection.\nMisstates -13        THE WITNESS: No.\nMS. PUJARI: -- prior\ntestimony.\nQUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS:\nQ.   Go ahead.\nA.   No. The chief inspector for\nthe NTSB stated in testimony that all of the\nrailcars in 32N that departed the TRRA there\nat Madison had both a mechanical inspection\nand Class I brake test performed.\nQ.   And that is the sole basis for\nyour belief that such an inspection had been\ndone on GPLX76545.\nPage 251 1 Q. Are you aware of anyone from 2 TRRA or Norfolk Southern looking to see 3 whether there was grease around the bearing 4 seals? 5 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Vague 6 as to -- 7 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS: 8 Q. For -- 9 MS. PUJARI: Sorry, were -- 10 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS: 11 Q. -- GPLX75465. 12 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Vague 13 as to time. 14 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS: 15 Q. I'm sorry, February 1st to 16 February 3rd -- let me ask a different 17 question. 18 Anytime between February 1st 19 until the time of the derailment in 2023, are 20 you aware of anybody from TRRA or Norfolk 21 Southern looking to see whether there was 22 grease around the bearing seals? 23 MS. PUJARI: On which car? 24 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS: 25 Q. In connection with GPLX75465.|Page 253 1 Is that correct? 2 A. In reading the materials in 3 preparation for this, yes, that is why I 4 believe that a mechanical inspection was 5 conducted -- 6 Q. Okay. 7 A. -- on those railcars. 8 Q. Now, if you go on in this same 9 document, it says that the bearings could 10 eventually fail and result -- I'm sorry. 11 It says, \"A loose bearing seal 12 could allow water and foreign particles into 13 the bearing while allowing lubricants to 14 escape. The bearing could eventually fail 15 and result in the car and train derailing.\" 16 Do you agree with that? 17 A. I think I would agree with 18 what's written here. 19 Q. Okay. And therefore, because a 20 loose bearing seal could allow water and 21 foreign particles into the bearing while 22 allowing lubricants to escape, which could 23 result in the car and train derailing, it's 24 important to conduct a proper mechanical 25 in s p e c t io n .|\nC o r r e c t ?\nA.   I agree that it is important to\ncomply with all rules, particularly 2.15.\nQ.   Okay. And if one wanted to\nknow whether, in fact, there was any leaky\nbearing or damaged component, they should at\nleast comply with the requirements of 215.13.\nC o r r e c t ?\nA.   Yeah. I think, again, 215.13\nshould be complied with, yes.\nQ.   Okay. Now, it goes on here in\nthis NTSB report to say, \"Time provided to\ninspect the train car. During their\ninterviews with the NTSB, the TCU\ndiscussed\" -- being the Transportation\nCommunications Union -- \"discussed the\nreduction in amount of time carmen have\navailable to inspect cars.\"\nDo you know who the\nTransportation Communications Union is?\nA.   It's a -- yes, I know the\nTransportation Communications Union.\nQ.   Who are they? Tell the jury\nwho that group is that the NTSB is referring\nto here.\nDo you see that?",
  "MS. PUJARI: Objection. Beyond\nthe scope of the 30(b)(6) topics.\nQUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS:\nQ.   Do you see that?\nA.   I see that's written.\nQ.   Okay. And then further on it\nsays, \"The TCU indicated in the last few\nyears, following the implementation of new\ntrain scheduling strategies, that Norfolk\nSouthern reduced the average amount of time\nfor car inspections to about one minute per\nc a r . \"\nIs that an accurate statement?\nMS. PUJARI: Objection. Beyond",
  "the scope of the 30(b)(6) topics.\nTHE WITNESS:  That's what's\nwritten here. I don't know if that's\nan accurate statement.\nQUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS:\nQ.   Okay. You agree with me,\nthough, that good business practice is to\nallow appropriate time, adequate time, to\nconduct a thorough inspection.\nC o r r e c t ?\nPage 255 1 A. The TCU is a union that 2 represents clerical employees. 3 Q. I'm sorry? 4 A. TCU is called the 5 Transportation Communications Union, who 6 represents clerical employees. 7 Q. Clerical employees only? 8 A. To my knowledge at Norfolk 9 Southern -- 10 Q. Okay. 11 A. -- they represent clerical 12 e m p lo y e e s . 13 Q. This goes on to say that 14 \"During their interview with the NTSB, the 15 TCU discussed the reduction in the amount of 16 time carmen have available to inspect cars. 17 They stated that about 20 years ago, carmen 18 were provided sufficient time, several 19 minutes, to inspect the cars, but that years 20 later, and before new car train scheduling 21 strategies were implemented in Norfolk 22 Southern and some other Class I railroads, 23 that time was reduced, on average, to 24 3 minutes to 3 minutes and 45 minutes {sic} 25 per car.\"|Page 257 1 MS. PUJARI: Objection to the 2 term of art, \"good business practice,\" 3 to the extent it calls for a legal 4 conclusion, and beyond the scope of 5 the 30(b)(6). 6 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS: 7 Q. You can answer. 8 A. I believe it is good business 9 practice to comply with federal regulations. 10 So whatever time is needed to -- for 11 compliance for, again -- 12 Q. Mr. -- 13 A. -- car inspections is -- I 14 s u p p o r t . 15 Q. Okay. Mr. Dixon, on behalf of 16 Norfolk Southern, can you tell me whether 17 it's a good business practice to allow 18 appropriate and adequate time to conduct a 19 thorough inspection? 20 MS. PUJARI: Same objection to 21 the term of art, legal conclusion, and 22 beyond the scope. 23 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS: 24 Q. If you can't answer the 25 question, just tell me you can't answer it.|\nA.   Again, we comply and work to -2    Q.   That's not what I asked.\nA.   We work to comply with all\nfederal regulations. And in -- to comply\nwith that, you have to afford appropriate\nt i m e .\nQ.   Okay. So to comply with legal\nregulations, you have to afford the folks\nconducting the inspection adequate time to do\na thorough inspection.\nC o r r e c t ?\nA.   That's why you have federal\nregulations in place, so these inspections\nand repairs can be conducted.\nQ.   All right. Now, part of\nfederal regulations, of course, deal with the\nresponsibility to ensure that you are putting\na safe car on your railway.\nC o r r e c t ?\nA.   Repeat that statement, please.\nQ.   Sure.\nIs there an obligation on\nbehalf of the railroad to comply with safety\ns t a n d a r d s ?\nA.   It's an obligation for the\nfiled against my clients.\nC o r r e c t ?",
  "A.   Yes, that Car 23 was improperly\nm a i n t a i n e d .\nQ.   All right. Now, let's talk\nabout what the basis for that was.\nIt says under paragraph 111\nthat \"Upon information and belief, Car 23 was\ntwice stationary for longer than six months 10 first for 565 days ending in August of 2018,\nand then again for 206 days ending in May\nof 2019.\"\nC o r r e c t ?\nA.   That's what it states, yes.\nQ.   Could you tell me everything\nthat you have -- you, Norfolk Southern, have\nreviewed in order to make that allegation?\nA.   I think I'd reference the -19 well, I know I'd reference the Norfolk -- or\nthe National Transportation Safety Board\ndocket Group B, Exhibit 5, the Mechanical\nGroup Factual Report.\nQ.   So let's look at that.\nAnd you agree with me at the\nbeginning that it's important to not\nPage 259 1 railroads to comply with federal regulations 2 regarding railroad responsibilities. 3 Q. Okay. Let's move on in the 4 interest of time. 5 Part of what was alleged was 6 that GATX did not maintain GPLX75365. 7 C o r r e c t ? 8 A. Can you -- 9 Q. Yeah. 10 A. Can you point that out here? 11 Q. Sure. 12 If you look at the complaint 13 and you go specifically to paragraphs -- let 14 me look real quick -- 106 to 114, the Car 23 15 was improperly maintained. That's what 16 Norfolk Southern alleges. 17 C o r r e c t ? 18 A. 106? 19 Q. Right there on top in bold 20 letters, \"Car 23 was improperly maintained.\" 21 C o r r e c t ? 22 A. Yes. 23 Q. All right. And that's the 24 basis, at least in part, for the complaint, 25 third-party complaint, that Norfolk Southern|Page 261 1 selectively pick statements out of reports 2 and cherry-pick statements. 3 C o r r e c t ? 4 A. Yes, I believe I already 5 responded to that question -- 6 Q. Okay. 7 A. -- and that was that I agree 8 with you. 9 (Dixon 30(b)(6) Exhibit 23 10 marked for identification.) 11 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS: 12 Q. So let's mark the Mechanical 13 Group Factual Report as the next exhibit. 14 It's Group B, Exhibit 5. 15 Mr. Dixon, this is the 16 document -- 17 MS. KARIS: I'm sorry, what 18 number are we? My apologies. 19 COURT REPORTER: 23. 20 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS: 21 Q. Okay. And we've marked it as 22 Exhibit 23 now. 23 This is the report that you're 24 relying on in connection with making the 25 allegations in paragraph 111 that we just|\nlooked at.\nC o r r e c t ?\nA.   That's correct.\nQ.   Now, if we look at this report,\nif you go to page 17 of 18 -- and you have\nthe complaint in front of you as well?\nA.   Yes.",
  "Q.   You have it? Great. Thank\ny o u .\nIf we look at the complaint\nfirst at paragraph 111, what it says there is\nthat \"Upon information and belief that this\nCar 23 was twice stationary for longer than\nsix months.\"\nR i g h t ?\nA.

And it goes on to say, \"Ending\nin August of 2018, it shows no movement for\ndays, and ending in May of 2019, it shows\nno movement for 206 days.\"\nDo you see that?\nA.   I see that.\nQ.   Okay. The \"upon information\nand belief\" that is in Norfolk Southern's\ncomplaint, is it based on a review of any\nevidence, any record, anything beyond those\nstatement -- two lines that we just read from\nthe mechanical factual report?\nMS. PUJARI: Objection to the",
  "extent it calls for a legal\nconclusion.\nTHE WITNESS: Yeah. I would\nsay the claim itself obviously is\ntaking a lot of the information from\nthe mechanical report with respect to\nthe car not moving, again, for the\ndesignated periods of time.\nPage 263 1 I don't know if this will work. 2 RRD23MR two zeros -- I'm sorry, 005. 3 Let's keep moving, in the 4 interest of time. 5 See at the top of page 17 of -- 6 and for the record, just to make everybody 7 clear, this Mechanical Group Factual Report 8 comes from the NTSB's docket, and it's 9 Exhibit 5 to that docket. 10 And that's what you've 11 identified as the single and sole basis for 12 paragraph 111 in Exhibit 1 where you list 13 what you relied on. 14 C o r r e c t ? 15 A. It is listed here as being 16 reviewed in support of the claim. 17 Q. And you specifically identify 18 page 17. 19 C o r r e c t ? 20 A. Yes. 21 Q. All right. And so if we look 22 at page 17, what it says there is that \"there 23 was a review of the last ten years of 24 movement history of car\" -- excellent. Thank 25 you so much -- \"of car GPLX75465, indicates|Page 265 1 To say that that's, again, what 2 I reviewed and what I'm looking at 3 here would be from the mechanical 4 factual report, I can't speak to if 5 there's any other movement record data 6 of that car during that ten-year 7 period that was reviewed or that we 8 have access to outside of these point 9 in times where, again, the ST -- or 10 the NTSB's factual report is stating 11 no movement for 565 days ending August 12 of 2018, and 206 days ending May 13 of 2019. 14 QUESTIONS BY MS.

On the night of February 3rd of 9 2 0 2 3 . 10 A. The -- again, the help desk 11 gets these alerts, so I would say -- I don't 12 know how many alerts they received that day, 13 but ones that would require them to queue up 14 and start looking at things, maybe two or 15 three a shift. 16 Q. Do you recall the video that we 17 watched earlier with the compilation of the 18 train moving from Sebring to Salem to East 19 Palestine -- actually, I think we started 20 just before it got to Salem over to East 21 Palestine -- where the -- there was fire that 22 could visibly be seen in the video? 23 Do you recall that? 24 A. Yes. 25 Q. Do you recall that by the time|\nthe train got to Salem, there was visible\nfire under the train?\nA.   Yes. I can't remember exactly\nwhere we saw the location on the video, but,\nyes, I recall watching the video.\nQ.   So Norfolk Southern's hot box\nsystem doesn't trigger an alert to the folks\non the train, even though there's a fire that\nis visible under the train.\nIs that correct?\nA.   In this case, again, the hot\nbox detector systems that are set up, the hot\nbox detectors themselves, are looking at\nthese temperature -- ambient temperatures,\nmaking comparisons. Again, if they don't -16 there's a certain threshold met, they would\nsend an alarm to the crew. It would be an\nauto -- audio -- you know, audible, talking\nalarm to provide direction to the train\nc r e w s .\nQ.   On the night of February 3rd,\neven though when the train got to Salem, Mile\nPost 69.01, there was fire under the train,\nthere was no alert or alarm sent to the crew\non the train.\nYou keep asking me did the crew\nreceive an alarm. The answer is no.\nQUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS:\nQ.   Did the wayside desk notify\nanybody on the train when the train passed\nSalem that they got an alert of some sort\nshowing a 70-plus-degree temperature increase\nfrom the last mile post that there was a\nregistered reading?\nA.   Again, the alert was generated\nbecause of the fact that it was -- the\nbearing was not -- over 90 degrees, and what\nwe call the K value, the comparison on the\ntrain, that bearing to others, had a value of\nover 4. That's what set the alert and the\nqueue to be monitored.\nQ.   Mr. Dixon, my question again\nis, did the wayside desk notify anybody on\nthe train when they got an alert that the\nreading from Sebring had gone from 38 degrees\nabove ambient temperature, to Salem,\ndegrees above ambient temperature, for\nthe L1 axle bearing; yes or no?\nA.

KARIS:\nQ.   Something was burning, and it\nwas emitting flames.\nC o r r e c t ?\nA.   Correct.\nQ.   Was there any notification from\nanybody at the desk to anybody on the train,\nthe conductor, the engineer, the conductor\ntrainee or anyone else, of any problems\nassociated with the train that had flames\ngoing under it?\nMS. PUJARI: Objection.\nAssumes facts not in evidence.\nTHE WITNESS: As I stated\nbefore, there was no communication\nwith the wayside help desk to the\ntrain crew following their movement\nover the hot box detailer -- or hot\nbox detector at Salem.\nQUESTIONS BY MS.

Does Norfolk Southern stand by\nits position that -- strike that.\nDoes Norfolk Southern stand by\nreadings, to make sure that, you know,\nwhat we're seeing, is there something\nt r e n d i n g .\nQUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS:\nQ.   Did anybody make that\ncomparison, to look to see what's trending,\nshould we contact the train, the crew on the\ntrain, to notify them of what we're seeing?\nDid anybody make that comparison and look for\nany trending?\nMS.

Not a\ntopic on which this witness is\ndesignated.\nQUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS:\nQ.   You can answer, sir.\nA.   My understanding is that that\nalert was sent to the wayside help desk, and\nit was queued for review.\nQ.   It was queued for the review.\nPage 307 1 the position that even though there is a 2 almost 70-degree increase in temperature over 3 a ten-mile distance, that no alert should be 4 sent to the crew on the train? 5 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Beyond 6 the scope of the 30(b)(6). 7 To the extent Mr. Dixon is 8 answering, he's answering on his own 9 behalf. 10 MS. KARIS: We can disagree 11 about that, but go ahead. 12 THE WITNESS: I would say that 13 again, our system is set up, the hot 14 box detector system is set up, first 15 of all. If it was set to a level to 16 where you would have an audible alarm 17 to the crew, that was the only -- 18 would be the only way you would 19 communicate directly to the crew. 20 The question was, should an 21 alert be set. 22 The alert that would be 23 generated, again, would be an alert 24 that something that needs to be 25 reviewed, compared with other|Page 309 1 Did anybody actually review the 2 data on the night of February 3rd to see how 3 that train's readings were trending between 4 Salem and East Palestine while the train was 5 on fire? 6 A. I'm not -- I'm not aware of 7 anybody reviewing all the data, but you said 8 on that night. Obviously the train, as it 9 passed Salem, when it gets to East Palestine, 10 then obviously the data at some point in time 11 has been reviewed. If that was your 12 q u e s t io n . 13 Q. At that point, the reading is 14 at 253 for the L1 axle bearing above ambient. 15 C o r r e c t ? 16 MS. PUJARI: At what point -- 17 objection. Vague. 18 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS: 19 Q. When the train gets to East 20 Palestine, following up on Mr. Dixon's 21 comment, that obviously the data at some 22 point was reviewed. 23 So my question is, by the time 24 it gets to East Palestine, now it triggers a 25 locomotive alert.|\nC o r r e c t ?\nIt doesn't just go to the desk.\nThere's an alert that actually goes off, an\nalarm that goes off on the train.\nC o r r e c t ?\nA.   There's an audible alarm that\ngoes off informing the crew.\nQ.   Right.\nSo my question is, anybody at\nall from the wayside help desk, at any time\nbefore that audible alert goes off on the\ntrain, anybody from the wayside desk reach\nout to anyone on the train and say, hey, I'm\nlooking at the data?\nNo, correct?\nA.   No.\nQ.   Are you aware of anybody even\nlooking at the data before the folks on the\ntrain get the audible alert?\nA.   I'm not aware of anybody\nreviewing the hot box detector data at Salem\nprior to the train arriving in East\nP a l e s t i n e .\nQ.   Would you agree with me it\nwould be a good practice if you're going to\nexpert testimony.\nTHE WITNESS:  I don't believe\nthat that would be a case where you\nwould be wanting to notify the crew\nevery time you had a jump in a bearing\ntemperature off one hot box detector.\nThe crews have a lot that\nthey're responsible to do while",
  "they're operating that train, and so\nthat's why you have a trending alert\nand different types of alerts.\nWhat the temperature -- I'm not",
  "an expert as to what you set those to,\nas far as what the variance should be,\nbut to take any type of variance and\ncommunicate that directly to the train\ncrew, you would have to -- if you were\ngoing to direct them or provide them\nwith information, you're going to be\nasking them to take some sort of\na c t i o n .\nSo until you -- until you get\nthe data that requires you to alert\nthem -- and again, I'm not the expert\nas to set -- when you say 80 degrees,\nPage 311 1 see a temperature differential of 80 degrees 2 between your left and your right bearing? 3 MS.

PUJARI: Not designated -- 11 not -- this witness is not designated 12 for this topic. 13 MS. KARIS: Okay. Let me 14 finish the question. Let me reread 15 the question. 16 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS: 17 Q. Would you agree with me it 18 would be a good practice, if you're going to 19 see a temperature differential of 20 approximately 70 degrees over a ten-mile 21 distance and an 83-degree temperature 22 differential between your left and your right 23 axle, to notify the crew on the train? 24 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Beyond 25 the scope of the 30(b)(6). Calls for|Page 313 1 I don't know if that's something that 2 should be communicated or not. 3 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS: 4 Q. You have three people on the 5 train that you would be communicating to, 6 c o r r e c t ? 7 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Beyond 8 the scope. Calls for expert testimony 9 and goes way beyond the scope of the 10 30(b)(6). 11 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS: 12 Q.

Mr. Dixon, good afternoon. My\nname is Brian Swanson. I represent Trinity,\nand I have a few questions for you this\nafternoon.\nOkay?\nA.   Okay.\nQ.   All right. So to start with, I\nhave put before you what's been marked as\nExhibit 28. This is Trinity's cross-notice\nof Rule 30(b)(6) videotaped deposition of\nNorfolk Southern.\nTake a quick look. I'm not\nQ.   Terrific.\nAnd those additional",
  "paragraphs, just for the record, are\nparagraphs 153, 154 and 190 of the\nthird-party complaint.\nCorrect?\nThat's on page 2. Oh, you just\npassed it. Here you go.\nA.   Okay.\nQ.   See those?\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   Are you ready to talk about\nthose?\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   Terrific.\nOkay. Before we dive into the\ncomplaint and the allegations, just to sort\nof set things up from Trinity's perspective,\nNorfolk Southern's claims against Trinity\nrelate to a single VCM car that Trinity\nleased to Oxy Vinyls.\nCorrect?\nA.   What car are you referring to?\nQ.   I'm referring to -- it's -- you\ncall it Car 26, or TILX402025.\nPage 315 1 going to spend a lot of time, but have you 2 seen this before? 3 A. I've seen the topic here, 4 but -- 5 Q. Well, maybe I can speed it up. 6 If you look at page 2. So this 7 morning you were provided by the -- by 8 plaintiff's counsel a 30(b)(6) deposition 9 notice, and we've been through that, and 10 you've talked about some of the allegations 11 in that notice. 12 Correct? 13 A. Correct. 14 Q. What Trinity did is we sent out 15 a notice that incorporated that -- the 16 previous notice that you've seen and then 17 added three paragraphs from the amended 18 complaint that we'd like to discuss with you. 19 Do you understand that? 20 A. I understand. 21 Q. And you're prepared to talk 22 about those additional paragraphs as the 23 corporate representative of Norfolk Southern. 24 True? 25 A. That's true.|Page 317 1 Do you see that? 2 A. Yes. 3 Q. And Trinity's claim -- or 4 excuse me. Norfolk Southern's claims against 5 Trinity relate solely to that car. 6 Correct? 7 A. My understanding is that is 8 correct. 9 Q. And that was one of the five 10 VCM cars that derailed on February 3rd in 11 East Palestine. 12 Right? 13 A. That's one of the five vinyl 14 chloride cars, correct. 15 Q. Norfolk Southern does not claim 16 that Car 26, or TILX402025, was in any way 17 responsible for causing the derailment of 18 Train 32N. 19 Right? 20 A. Again, I wouldn't -- the 21 cause -- the derailment cause, I think, is 22 still under investigation, but I don't 23 believe, again, there's any -- there's any 24 root cause for the actual derailment assigned 25 at this point in time to TILX402025.|\nQ.   Right.\nI mean, Norfolk Southern has\nsued Trinity, right? Right, sir?\nA.   That's correct.\nQ.   And in that lawsuit, you do not\nclaim that Car 26, or 402025, was in any way\nresponsible for causing the derailment of\nN.\nRight?\nA.   I don't have any indication\nthat we are making that claim.\nQ.   And you testified to that as\nthe representative of Norfolk Southern.\nRight?",
  "A.   What I would -- what I would\nclaim is, again, what we've stated in the\nclaims on certain paragraphs, such as, you\nknow, providing ordinary care, failing to\nproperly certify the design, build and\nconversion testing, modifications to tank\ncars and their components with both Trinity\nand Oxy Vinyls and GATX.\nQ.   Sir, we're going to get into\nthe allegations you have made against\nTrinity. I thought my question was pretty\nof Norfolk Southern's complaint labeled the\nDerailment Response.\nRight?\nA.   Correct.\nQ.   Paragraph 74 begins, \"By\nmidnight, a unified command team was formed,\ncomprised of,\" and then it lists a number of\nentities comprising that unified command\nteam.\nRight?\nA.   Correct.\nQ.   One of the entities that's\nlisted is the Norfolk Southern HAZMAT team.\nDo you see that?\nA.   I do see that.\nQ.   Who were the members of the\nNorfolk Southern HAZMAT team?\nA.   I would have to look at every\none represented there. I don't -- I couldn't\ntell you.\nQ.   Can you tell me anyone?\nA.   I would say -- I could probably\nname one.\nQ.   Who is that?\nA.   Robert Wood.\nPage 319 1 simple. 2 You do not allege in your 3 complaint that Trinity's Car 402025 had 4 anything to do with causing the derailment. 5 Correct? 6 A. Again, as I stated before, I 7 don't believe that we have any information 8 right now that definitively states what 9 caused the derailment. There is -- there is 10 right now nothing I can point to that says, 11 again, Car 26, TILX402025, caused the 32N 12 derailment. 13 Q. Let's, if you could, please, 14 open or take out Exhibit 4. That's the 15 third-party complaint that you've been 16 testifying about so far today. 17 And I'm going to try to go 18 through it in some order, and I'll start, if 19 you can please turn to paragraph 74, which is 20 on page 16. 21 Are you there? 22 A. Page 70 -- I mean, 74? 23 Q. Yeah, page 16. 24 A. Yes, I'm there. 25 Q. Okay. And this is in a section|Page 321 1 Q. And you testified about him 2 earlier today. 3 Right? 4 A. Correct. 5 Q. Can't name anyone else as you 6 sit here today? 7 A. No, not off memory. 8 Q. All right. Let me see if I can 9 jog your memory. 10 Do you know Drew McCarty from 11 SPSI, or Specialized Professional Services, 12 Inc.? 13 A. No, I don't know Drew McCarty. 14 Q. Do you know that entity, SPSI? 15 A. Yes. 16 Q. Is SPSI a contractor for 17 Norfolk Southern? 18 A. Yes, they are. 19 Q. Do you work with them 20 occasionally on train derailments like this 21 one? 22 A. Yes. 23 Q. Did SPSI have folks on the 24 ground at East Palestine after the derailment 25 advising on derailment response?|\nA.   SPSI had representatives at\nEast Palestine.\nQ.   And as part of preparing for\nthis deposition, did you read any interviews\nor testimony from folks at SPSI?\nA.   There was some information, or\nSPSI was mentioned in several locations\nthroughout the documents.\nQ.   Do you recall reading anything\nfrom SPSI that you thought was untrue or\nincorrect?\nA.   Nothing struck me as being\nuntrue.\nQ.   Do you know a Charles Day or\nChip Day from Specialized Response Solutions,\nor SRS?\nA.   I don't know that individual\npersonally.\nQ.   I apologize if I didn't ask\nyou.\nWere individuals from SPSI part\nof the Norfolk Southern HAZMAT team?\nA.   They were working as\ncontractors for Norfolk Southern. I\nwouldn't -- I mean, as they -- were they part\nA.   No, I was just going to say,\nnot only just Norfolk Southern, but pretty\nmuch everybody on this united command team if\nthey had the need for other instances.\nIn other words, there's not a\nlarge number of these specialized groups out\nthere to deal with the types of situations.\nQ.   What was the specific role of\nthe Norfolk Southern HAZMAT team in the\nunified command structure?\nA.   I'm not privy to the role the\nNS team played as opposed to the other team\nmembers.\nQ.   Well, did the NS team -- you've\ntestified about this a bit this morning, this\nafternoon.\nBut did the NS HAZMAT team\nadvise on how to handle the derailed VCM\ncars?\nA.   They -- I think everybody in\nthe command team had some input, and\nobviously Norfolk Southern's HAZMAT team\nwould have input and provide guidance.",
  "Q.   So the Norfolk Southern HAZMAT\nteam, they had input at the unified command\nPage 323 1 of the unified command team? They probably 2 were, again, assisting. 3 Q. They were at least assisting 4 Norfolk Southern in its role as a member of 5 the unified command team? 6 A. I would say that they were 7 assisting the unified command team. 8 Q. Okay. And is that the same for 9 Specialized Response Solutions, or SRS? 10 A. Yes. 11 Q. Are they another Norfolk 12 Southern contractor? 13 A. They were another group that 14 Norfolk Southern brought in to assist. 15 Q. Another -- 16 A. Contractor. 17 Q. Another contractor that Norfolk 18 Southern works with from time to time on 19 train derailments? 20 A. Occasionally, again, depending 21 on the situation, as well as pretty much 22 everybody else on that united command team, 23 if needed. 24 Q. I didn't mean to interrupt you, 25 I'm sorry.|Page 325 1 on whether to conduct a vent and burn, for 2 example. 3 True? 4 A. I believe, again, I believe 5 everybody on the command team had the 6 opportunity to provide input. 7 Q. Okay. I'm asking about Norfolk 8 Southern HAZMAT team. 9 A. Which I would agree. 10 Q. Okay. 11 A. Norfolk Southern as well. 12 Q. And that Norfolk Southern 13 HAZMAT team, they had input at the unified 14 command on whether polymerization was 15 occurring in any of the derailed VCM cars. 16 True? 17 A. I think, as we've heard from a 18 number of people today, a lot of people were 19 providing input as to whether or not 20 polymerization or -- 21 Q. Again, I'm focused on Norfolk 22 Southern at the unified command. 23 The Norfolk Southern HAZMAT 24 team had input at the unified command on 25 whether polymerization was occurring within|\nany of the derailed VCM cars.\nRight?\nA.   They had input with their\nthoughts with respect to polymerization.\nQ.   Now, no one from Trinity\nprovided any input or advised on whether a\nvent and burn operation should be performed\non the derailed VCM cars.\nRight?\nA.   I don't have any information\nthat says that Trinity provided any input.\nQ.   So based on your knowledge as a\ncorporate representative of Norfolk Southern,\nTrinity had no input on whether to perform\nthe vent and burn operation.\nTrue?\nA.   Again, I don't have any\ninformation that claims Trinity had any input\non any of the rail cleanup.\nQ.   Okay. So the answer to my\nquestion is, correct, true.\nRight?\nMS. PUJARI: Objection. Asked\nand answered.\nTHE WITNESS: Could you repeat\nthat anyone from Trinity advised on whether\npolymerization was or was not occurring in\nany of the derailed VCM cars.\nTrue?\nA.   I haven't seen any, again,\ninformation that Trinity provided.\nQ.   Flip a page, please, to\npage 17. I want to look at paragraph 81.\nAre you there?\nA.   I'm there.\nQ.   Paragraph 81 reads, \"Following\na tank car derailment and fire, responders\ntypically have four options.\"\nDo you see that?\nA.   I see that.\nQ.   So focusing to begin on the\nfirst option, it says, \"First, responders can",
  "re-rail the tank car and move it to the next\ndestination if they determine there is no\ntank damage.\"\nDo you see that?\nA.   I do see that.\nQ.   And at some point in time,\nre-railing one or more of the vinyl chloride\ncars was something that unified command\nPage 327 1 your question -- 2 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON: 3 Q. Sure can. 4 A. -- because I'm just trying -- 5 Q. Yeah, yeah, you bet. 6 A. -- to provide with you an 7 appropriate response. 8 But go ahead and ask your 9 question again. 10 Q. No one from Trinity advised the 11 unified command whether or not it should 12 perform a vent and burn operation on the 13 derailed VCM cars. 14 Correct? 15 A. And again, it's not correct or 16 not correct, because I don't know, other 17 than -- I don't have any information that 18 leads me to believe Trinity provided any 19 information to that command team, to that 20 incident command group. Again, I don't know. 21 Did somebody at Trinity call 22 somebody? I don't know. I have seen no 23 information at all that any information was 24 provided to that -- to that team. 25 Q. You've also seen no information|Page 329 1 considered. 2 Right? 3 A. Yes. I would say that they did 4 consider that. 5 Q. Yeah. 6 And the folks at Norfolk 7 Southern and at SPSI and at SRS, they helped 8 advise on that, didn't they? 9 A. I would assume, again, 10 everybody on that team was looking through 11 each one of these options. 12 Q. Okay. Now, focused on Norfolk 13 Southern and its contractors that it hired, 14 would Norfolk Southern consider re-railing a 15 tank car that it determined was not stable? 16 A. No. 17 MS. PUJARI: Objection. 18 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON: 19 Q. Why not? 20 A. For safety reasons. 21 Q. Would Norfolk Southern or its 22 contractors consider re-railing a car if that 23 tank car's pressure release device was not 24 functioning properly? 25 A. Again, if you're having a|\nrelease, then you're not going to put -2 you're not going to re-rail a car that is\nhaving a pressure release -4    Q.   Okay.\nA.   -- the valve release product.\nQ.   So if you don't think the\npressure release device is working properly,\nyou're not going to put that car back on the\nrails.\nRight?\nA.   Again, it's one of those, is\nthere a -- is there -- there has to be an\nassessment of the risk associated with the\ndamage that could potentially occur.\nIf you're asking me if you have\na tank car where the PRDs are not working,\nwould you put that back on the rail, well, if\nyou've had -- if you have no product in a car\nand there's -- it's just literally an empty\ntank, and the PRDs are no longer functional\nand there's no risk, then the answer would\nbe, yes, I don't believe there would be any\nissue with re-railing the tank and moving it.\nQ.   Okay. But if a car still has\nVCM in it, would you re-rail that car if the\nQ.   Okay. Now, if I look at\nparagraph 81, it says that the second option\nin responding to a derailment is, \"If the\ntank car is damaged and cannot be safely\nre-railed and moved, responders can transfer\nthe product from the tank car using the\ntransfer valves.\"\nRight?",
  "A.   Yes, I see that.\nQ.   And then number 3 talks about\nhot tapping.\nRight?\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   And then the fourth option, it\ntalks about -- you say the last resort is the\nvent and burn.\nRight?\nA.   Within paragraph 81, it does\nmention vent and burn is the fourth option.\nQ.   Right.\nAnd they say vent and burn is\nthe last resort, right?\nA.   Yeah, that's what it says here.\nQ.   And it's a last resort because\nwhen you vent and burn, you send all sorts of\nPage 331 1 PRD, or pressure release device, was not 2 functioning properly? 3 A. I'm not, again, the technical 4 expert on that, so, again, I would leave that 5 up to our HAZMAT specialists and safety 6 group. 7 Q. Would Norfolk Southern consider 8 re-railing a tank car if they believed that 9 vinyl chloride in that tank car was actively 10 polymerizing? 11 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Calls 12 for expert testimony. 13 THE WITNESS: Again, I'm not an 14 expert in that field, but I would not 15 believe that anybody would re-rail a 16 car that was actively -- 17 polymerization was occurring. 18 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON: 19 Q. Or at risk for -- 20 A. Or at risk. They felt there 21 was a risk for that. 22 Q. Okay. Same thing. That 23 wouldn't be safe to do that. 24 Right? 25 A. Correct.|Page 333 1 chemicals up into the environment and onto 2 the ground. 3 Right? 4 A. Well, there's -- yes, I mean, 5 that's one of those things where you're 6 thinking, okay, here's my options. This is 7 what we want to do first, second, third, and 8 you work through. 9 I'm not -- again, I'm not an 10 expert in HAZMAT, so I can't tell you exactly 11 why that fourth option, they refer to it as 12 the last resort, other than they've come to a 13 conclusion that there's no other steps to 14 take in order to control whatever hazard is 15 still being presented, right? 16 So if there is believed, 17 perceived risk, they're trying to work 18 through, how do we elevate the perceived risk 19 and the hazard that's being presented. 20 So if they're saying, look, 21 this is our last resort because we've got a 22 risk here that we can't ignore, and I'm 23 looking down through my choices, then, yes, 24 they're going to try to mitigate the risk, 25 the safety risk, that's being presented to|\nthem. And if that's their last resort, then,\nyes, that's why I guess they're saying that's\ntheir last resort.\nQ.   What about -- what about just\nmoving a tank car? I mean, you can move it\nback onto the rails, but you can also move it\naway from a fire.\nRight? Is that an option?\nA.   The same concerns with\nre-railing that you spoke to earlier would\napply to moving it. Whether it's re-railing\nit, moving it by train or putting it on a\ntruck or whatever the case, I think the same\ntype of decisions are being assessed, or\nrisks are being assessed.\nQ.   Got it.\nBut if a car, if a derailed\ncar, was deemed to be stable, one option you\nwould have, rather than re-railing it, is\njust to move it out of the way of fires and\nother perceived dangers.\nRight?\nMS. PUJARI: Objection. Vague\nas to \"stable.\"\nTHE WITNESS: Yeah. What -\nknow better than anybody here about the\nstructure of the tank car. Anytime one of\nthose cars hits the ground off the rail,\nthere's potential for structural integrity\nissues.\nYou know, if you're only\nlooking at the jacket and then the thermal\nprotection system, there's -- again, an\nassessment is going to be made about moving\nthat car because, again, you have to make an\nassessment as to what the risk is. And quite\nhonestly, with all of the safety data sheets\nthat I've seen with respect to vinyl",
  "chloride, I don't think anybody that looked\nat that safety data sheet could tell you that\na single one of those vinyl chloride cars\nthat had sat in those pool fires for the\namount of time that it did, that that would\nbe considered stored -- stored appropriately.\nQ.   Let me ask you a different\nquestion. Let me ask you a different\nquestion.\nIf a car -- if a tank car, a\nVCM tank car, was in -- in a position where\nit was deemed it could be re-railed, okay?\nPage 335 1 when you say \"stable,\" what are you 2 referring to? 3 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON: 4 Q. Well -- 5 A. When a car is stable, so 6 what -- 7 Q. Okay. 8 A. I want to answer your question. 9 Q. Yeah, I know you do. I know 10 you do. 11 So if a car is exhibiting the 12 characteristics that it was exhibiting when 13 it was on the rail before it had derailed, 14 okay, in terms of pressure and temperature, 15 it's stable. 16 Okay? Right? Are you with me? 17 That's what I'm talking about as stable? 18 A. According to -- you stated 19 pressure and temperature. 20 Q. Temperature. Use those two. 21 A. In a derailment -- and you're 22 referring to tank cars? 23 Q. I am, sir. 24 A. Okay. Anytime a tank car is 25 derailed, there is potentially -- and you|Page 337 1 You with me? 2 A. I'm with you. 3 Q. So the folks at Norfolk 4 Southern say, we can re-rail this car. It's 5 possible to re-rail. It's safe enough to 6 re-rail it. 7 Okay? 8 Another option, if you couldn't 9 re-rail it, would just be to move it out of 10 the way of danger. 11 Right? 12 A. If you made the risk of 13 allowing that tank just to sit there, yes, 14 could you potentially move it? 15 Again, you take -- you would 16 literally make an assessment -- 17 Q. Yeah. 18 A. -- as to what is in the best 19 interests at that point in time for the 20 safety of everybody, to include the personnel 21 and all of the individuals in the community. 22 Q. Yep. Got it. Okay. Thanks. 23 Let's move along, if we can, to 24 paragraph 94. This is again a paragraph 25 that's dealing with the response to the|\nderailment.\nOkay?\nParagraph 94 begins,\nResponders attempted to collect further tank\ncar measurements while they continued\ncollecting potential readings through the\nsmall holes in the jackets.\"\nAnd you know that refers to\ntemperature readings.\nRight?\nA.   Right.\nQ.   Yeah.\nResponders were unable to\ncollect internal tank pressure measurements\ndue to the comprised valve assemblies and\nrisk of placing personnel alongside\ndangerously unstable cars.\"\nDid I read that correctly?\nA.   You did.\nAnd could you repeat your last\nquestion for me? You wanted me to confirm\nwhat these tank pressure measurements were or\nare?\nQ.   Yeah. It refers to readings\nthrough the small holes in the jackets, and\nQ.   Yeah, you bet I can, but I'm\nfirst asking you if you know that's true or\nnot.\nA.   Again, I'm going to have to\nlook at the documentation.\nQ.   Okay. So you don't know that\nNorfolk Southern's own contractors were able\nto hook up a gauge to TILX402025 and get its\npressure readings? You didn't know that?\nA.   I believe there was one tank\ncar whose valves were not damaged to the\nextent that, yes, they could get a reading.\nQ.   Okay. So let's look at the\nexhibit previously marked as Exhibit 13.\nDo you have that in front of\nyou?\nA.   I'm trying to find it here. I\ndon't have it in front of me. It's a\nhazardous -- okay.\nQ.   Do you have that in front of\nyou, sir?\nA.   I do.\nQ.   And I'm going to ask you to\nturn, if you can, please, to page 82 of 158.\nAre you there?\nPage 339 1 that refers to temperature readings. 2 Correct? 3 A. I would say that if you're 4 trying to access the tank, that would 5 probably be a temperature reading. 6 Q. Okay. And now I want to focus 7 on this allegation that Norfolk Southern made 8 that responders were unable to collect 9 internal tank pressure measurements. 10 Okay? 11 All right, sir? 12 A. Okay. 13 Q. And you know now that that 14 allegation is untrue. 15 Right? 16 A. What allegation are you saying 17 is not untrue? I'm sorry, is untrue? 18 Q. That responders were unable to 19 collect internal tank pressure measurements 20 from any tank cars. 21 That's not true, is it, sir? 22 A. Can you show me any of the 23 documentation that says that they were able 24 to collect internal tank pressure 25 measurements?|Page 341 1 A. I'm on page 82, yes. 2 Q. Okay. And if you look at the 3 very last paragraph on page 82, you see 4 there, \"The SRS damage assessment of the VCM 5 tank cars on the morning of February 5th.\" 6 Do you see that? 7 A. Yes. 8 Q. Okay. So that's just to 9 situate us on the date there, February 5. 10 The very last word on that 11 page, and then we're going to continue to 12 page 83. 13 Okay? 14 So it says, it reads, \"Crews 15 attached a pressure gauge to 28 TILX402025 16 and found a tank pressure of 60 PSIG.\" 17 Do you see that? 18 A. I do. 19 Q. You understand, sir, that 20 60 PSIG is a normal pressure reading from a 21 tank containing stabilized vinyl chloride 22 monomer? 23 A. Again, I believe I've seen that 24 as a -- as a tank pressure for vinyl 25 chloride, but, again, I'm not an expert, so|\nI'm not -- I don't know if I would just come\nout and say I agree with that, but I believe\nI've seen that as the normal temperature -4    Q.   Sure. And -5    A.   Tank pressure.\nQ.   -- you certainly don't claim\nthat 60 PSIG is an abnormally high pressure\nreading for a VCM tank, right?\nA.   I would agree with that.\nQ.   And you know now that the\nNorfolk Southern contractors continued to\nmonitor the pressure of TILX402025 from that\npoint forward.\nTrue?\nA.   It's true.\nQ.   You know also that the pressure\nreadings on TILX402025 never exceeded\nPSIG.\nRight?",
  "A.   I'm not familiar with that, so\ncan you point me to a document that shows the\npressure readings were -- of 65 -23    Q.   If you don't know, I'm not\ngoing to -- I'm not going to ask you more.\nYou don't know?\ntemperature is a potential concern.\nAnd I believe it was less than\ndegrees or so at East Palestine\nduring the point in time of\nderailment.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:\nQ.   Okay.\nA.   So I don't -- I wouldn't -- I\nwouldn't agree with your statement, sir.\nQ.   You don't consider yourself an\nexpert on that, do you?\nA.   I don't.\nQ.   And the folks at SPSI who are\non the ground at the time, they would have\nmore expertise in that area?\nIs that fair?\nA.   I believe all the HAZMAT\nrepresentatives that were on the ground from\nNorfolk Southern and their contractors would\nhave more expertise than myself, yes.\nQ.   That's why they're there,\nright?\nA.   That's right.\nQ.   Okay. Let's look -- let's look\nat paragraph 96, if we can flip back and\nPage 343 1 A. Again, I'm not following where 2 you got the 65 -- never exceeded 65. 3 Q. Do you know one way or the 4 other? That's my question. 5 A. At this point, I'm not sure. 6 Q. Okay. And we've seen the 7 temperature readings that were obtained from 8 TILX402025. 9 Right? 10 A. Yes, I believe we've seen some 11 temperature readings. 12 Q. And those temperature readings 13 were normal. 14 True? 15 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Vague. 16 THE WITNESS: No, I don't -- I 17 wouldn't say that those temperature 18 readings were normal. 19 Again, I believe if you look at 20 some of the material that was 21 provided, such as the Vinyl Chloride 22 Institute's data and other material 23 concerning vinyl chloride, that any 24 type of temperature on a vinyl 25 chloride tank car that's above ambient|Page 345 1 forth. 2 But I'm going to come back to 3 Exhibit 13, so don't put it too far from you. 4 A. All right. 5 Q. Okay. So I'm going to look at, 6 again, paragraph 96. 7 And we've talked a lot about 8 the vent and burn decision. I'm not going to 9 go over everything again. 10 But I just want to look at 11 that -- on 96, at paragraph 96, midway 12 through, it says, \"By approximately noon, 13 unified command agreed that a vent and burn 14 of all five vinyl chloride tank cars, cars 15 26, 27, 28, 29 and 53, should occur.\" 16 Right? 17 A. That's what -- yes. 18 Q. And that was a recommendation, 19 you've testified about, that was made to the 20 unified command by the -- by the folks at 21 Norfolk Southern who were on the ground. 22 Right? 23 MS. PUJARI: Objection. 24 Mischaracterizes prior testimony. 25 THE WITNESS: Yeah, I think|\nthe -- I think what was -- the\nrecommendation, again, was coming from\na number of sources over a period of\ntime from a number of people on the -5    within the incident command group.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:\nQ.   Didn't say Norfolk Southern was\nalone. I just want your testimony.\nNorfolk Southern was\nrecommending that all five vinyl chloride\ncars being vented and burned.\nCorrect?\nMS. PUJARI: Objection.\nMischaracterizes prior testimony.\nTHE WITNESS: I believe Norfolk\nSouthern, again, came to that\nconclusion with the team of -- looking\nat all the data, again, over a period\nof time.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:\nQ.   Now, when Norfolk Southern, you\nsaid, came to that conclusion to vent and\nburn Trinity's car 402025, that car was\nstable, wasn't it?\nMS. PUJARI: Objection. Vague\nto...\nQ.   To sit there, do nothing?\nA.   To sit there and do nothing -4    Q.   Right.\nA.   -- with the concern that you\nwere looking at a potential explosion.\nQ.   Let me ask you. Let's see what\nthe folks on the ground thought about 402025.\nIf you can turn again, please,\nto Exhibit 13.\nAnd when I say \"folks on the\nground,\" I mean Norfolk Southern and its\ncontractors.\nOkay?\nDo you have Exhibit 13 up? Or,\nexcuse me, in front of you?\nA.   I have 13 in front of me.\nQ.   Okay. And if you could please\nturn to page 85.\nYou see the middle paragraph\nthere begins \"Following that\"?\nSee that?\nIt says, \"Following that, SRS\ncrews.\"\nAnd those are the contractors\nPage 347 1 as to \"stable.\" 2 THE WITNESS: Yeah. Again, I 3 don't think anybody, having read the 4 safety data sheets that accompanied 5 these tank cars with vinyl chloride, 6 could have come to the conclusion that 7 the vinyl chloride was still stable 8 after going through what it went 9 through for those days. 10 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON: 11 Q. You think that's right? 12 A. I believe anybody, again, 13 looking at the safety data sheet, looking at 14 these emergency response guide, looking at 15 the information from the vinyl chloride, 16 would come to the conclusion that, okay, we 17 can move -- we can move that car. We can -- 18 we want to do something else with this car. 19 I think they looked at the 20 risks associated with what they were being 21 addressed to at that point in time and came 22 to the conclusion, this is the safest action 23 that we can take instead of just letting 24 those cars -- again, if they didn't vent and 25 burn, the op -- the alternative is, what,|Page 349 1 that Norfolk Southern hired to come and help 2 out, right? 3 A. They were a contractor, yes. 4 Q. Right. 5 They're the professionals in 6 dealing with derailments, right? 7 A. They are some of the 8 professionals that were brought in. 9 Q. Okay. \"The SRS crews assisted 10 with moving burning hopper cars away from the 11 east end so that the crews could attempt to 12 re-rail VCM Car TILX402025 because the car 13 was determined to be stable with a pressure 14 of 60 PSIG.\" 15 Did I read that correctly? 16 A. That's what's written here. 17 Q. Okay. So the pros at SRS 18 looked at 402025 and said, that car is 19 stable, we can put it back on the rail and 20 send it on its way. 21 Right? 22 MS. PUJARI: Objection. 23 Mischaracterizes the document. 24 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON: 25 Q. Correct, sir?|\nA.   No, I don't think they were\nsaying we could put this car back on the\nrail. Again, there was damage to the bolster\nassemblies on both sides of the car, as it\nsays here.\nQ.   Okay. How about this. But for\nthe damage to the bolster, the professionals\nat SRS were recommending that you take\nput it back on the rails and send it\non its way.\nRight?\nA.   I don't take that from reading\nthis paragraph.\nQ.   Oh, you -- how do you take it\nthen? How do you take that paragraph?\nA.   I take it -- I take it that the\npressure appeared to be stable pressure of\nPSI.\nQ.   How do you take the attempt to\nre-rail the car? What does that mean to you?\nMS. PUJARI: Objection.\nMischaracterizes the document.\nTHE WITNESS: When you see\nattempt to re-rail the car,\" where do\nyou see that? I'm looking at the\nto re-rail the VCM car.\nIt was determined to have a\nstable pressure of 60 PSI.\nAgain, looking at the context,\nother than reading that sentence,\nthat's what I take away from that\nsentence.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:\nQ.   You take away that -- from that\nsentence that TILX402025 had the potential to\nbe re-railed?\nMS. PUJARI: Objection.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:\nQ.   Given its -- given its pressure\nreadings?\nMS. PUJARI: Objection.\nMisstates the document.\nTHE WITNESS: Yeah. From\nthat -- from that sentence, I would\nsay that there was a potential for\nthem to assess whether or not they can\nre-rail the TILX402025.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:\nQ.   Right.\nWhat happened is that\nPage 351 1 document you referenced and the 2 paragraph -- 3 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON: 4 Q. Can we highlight that or 5 underline it there? I thought it was clear. 6 A. Okay. \"Attempt to re-rail the 7 cars.\" 8 Q. Yeah. Now, I think you 9 testified earlier that the folks at Norfolk 10 Southern and its contractors wouldn't attempt 11 to re-rail a VCM car if it was unsafe. 12 Do you remember that testimony? 13 A. Yes, if it was deemed to be 14 unsafe. 15 Q. Okay. So the folks at SRS, the 16 contractors for Norfolk Southern, had 17 determined that VCM Car TILX402025 was not 18 unsafe and could be re-railed, if possible. 19 True? 20 MS. PUJARI: Objection. 21 Misstates the document. 22 THE WITNESS: I think the 23 statement, the way I read the 24 statement, is that they were sent in 25 from the east to look at the potential|Page 353 1 unfortunately they determined, when they went 2 out to try to re-rail this thing, that the 3 bolster was in such a condition that they 4 couldn't drag it back onto the rails. 5 Right? 6 A. Well, the bolster assemblies, 7 again, I don't think, is the only reason you 8 would not re-rail. Anytime a railway -- a 9 railcar derails, there would be nothing 10 preventing somebody from bringing in 11 additional wheel sets if that was considered 12 to be, again, the safest opportunity at that 13 time. 14 But again, re-railing at that 15 point in time, I guess the context here is 16 what period of time. 17 Q. Well, the context right here is 18 Norfolk Southern wants its rail to get open 19 again. 20 Right? 21 MS. PUJARI: Objection. 22 Misstates the evidence. 23 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON: 24 Q. And if you bring in an extra 25 set of wheels and put those on, that's going|\nto take time, right?\nMS. PUJARI: Objection. Form.\nTHE WITNESS: Norfolk Southern\nwas wanting to make sure that the\nissues that were presented and the\nsafety risks that were prevented were\naddressed, number one.\nObviously, if we re-railed all\nthe cars and had the possibility to\nre-rail everything and just haul it\nout, that would be the fastest thing\nfor the cleanup, but that's not the\nsafest course of action.\nIf we could have transferred\nthe product, that would have been the\nfastest thing. But, again, it wasn't\nthe safest action, and we couldn't\ntake that action.\nEvery time they went through\ntheir decision matrix as to figure\nout, what do we do, they're looking at\nit from the standpoint of safety.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:\nQ.   Okay. Well, let me challenge\nyou on that.\ndon't -- I don't take that away from\nthis, I guess, quote from the SRS\nsenior project manager.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:\nQ.   Okay. Let's look then back at\nthe Exhibit 4, the complaint.\nI want to focus on\nparagraph 120.\nMS. PUJARI: Counsel, 120?\nMR. SWANSON: Paragraph 120.\nMS. PUJARI: Thank you.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:\nQ.   It's on page 24.\nAre you there?\nA.   I'm there.\nQ.   Okay. Paragraph 20 reads,\nHere, there were multiple discrepancies\nidentified by the Federal Railroad\nAdministration between the approved documents\nand the actual physical characteristics of\nthe vinyl fluoride\" -- \"vinyl chloride tank\ncars on Train 32N.\"\nDo you see that?\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   And just as a housekeeping\nPage 355 1 If you look at the testimony of 2 the SRS senior project manager, do you see 3 that right below what we've been reading? 4 Do you see that? 5 He says, \"Based on the damage, 6 we're not going to be able to ship this stuff 7 down the road, so we might as well just -- we 8 might as well, based on the risk management 9 scenario, vent and burn all five cars.\" 10 \"Might as well vent and burn.\" 11 That was the decision, right? 12 A. I'm still reading the quote -- 13 Q. Go ahead. 14 A. -- if you don't mind. 15 So can you repeat the question? 16 I've read the paragraph. 17 Q. The decision to vent and burn 18 TILX402025 wasn't made because that car posed 19 any danger; it was made because they couldn't 20 decide what else to do with it. 21 Right? 22 MS. PUJARI: Objection. 23 Mischaracterizes prior testimony and 24 the document. 25 THE WITNESS: Yeah. Again, I|Page 357 1 matter, Norfolk Southern makes the same 2 allegation in -- or similar allegation in 3 paragraph 152. 4 Correct? 5 A. Similar. 6 Q. Okay. So looking at 7 paragraph 120, it says that these so-called 8 discrepancies were identified by the Federal 9 Railroad Administration. 10 Right? 11 A. Yes. 12 Q. When did the Federal Railroad 13 Administration identify these so-called 14 discrepancies? 15 A. I couldn't -- I couldn't 16 testify here today about when they first 17 identified these discrepancies. I can tell 18 you that I reviewed information during the 19 investigative hearing where the FRA 20 representative, Mr. Kertz {sic}, I guess, 21 testified on his findings comparing the 22 railcars at the derailment to the actual 23 AAR -- AAR Form 4-2, the certificate of 24 construction. 25 Q. Okay. And we'll get to -- it's|\nMr. Keltz, I believe, right?\nA.   I believe that was the FRA\nrepresentative.\nQ.   Okay. Other than that analysis\nby the FRA or Mr. Keltz and any documents\nthey might have created or testimony they\ngave, did Norfolk Southern do any independent\nanalysis into any discrepancies between the\nAAR form and the actual car?\nA.   I'm not aware of any Norfolk\nSouthern employees looking at -- looking at\nthe actual characteristics versus the\ncertificates of construction.\nQ.   At any time, right?\nA.   I'm not aware -- again, I'm not\naware if it occurred, so it would be anytime,\nbecause, again, I'm not aware that it\noccurred.\nQ.   Right.\nAnd but more focused, certainly\nbetween February 3rd, when the train\nderailed, and February 6th, when the vent and\nburn was executed, nobody at Norfolk Southern\nhad any information regarding any so-called\ndiscrepancies between the AAR Form 4-2 and\nQ.   Okay. And before Norfolk\nSouthern saw that document or saw that\ntestimony, was anyone at Norfolk Southern\naware of the so-called discrepancies between\nthe certificate of construction and Car 26's\nactual characteristics?\nA.   I'm not aware of anybody being\naware of it.\nQ.   What were the specific\ndiscrepancies that you refer to in\nsubparagraph A?\nA.   I don't have those down to\nmemory, so if we want to take a look at the\ninvestigative hearing transcript -15    Q.   Sure.\nA.   -- we can go through -- go\nthrough that and...\nQ.   What do you want to look at?\nYou tell me.\nA.   Okay. Let's go to the\ninvestigative hearing transcript, Day 2,\npages 630 through 636.\nDixon 30(b)(6) Exhibit 29\nmarked for identification.)\nPage 359 1 the tank car's actual characteristics. 2 Correct? 3 A. Again, I'm not aware of any -- 4 any information that was supplied to NS 5 showing the discrepancies between the actual 6 car characteristics and the certificate of 7 construction during that time. 8 Q. If you look at the 9 subparagraph A in paragraph 120, it says, 10 \"Trinity Industries Leasing Company's Car 26 11 has discrepancies between its AAR 4-2 12 certificate of construction and the tank 13 car's actual characteristics.\" 14 Do you see that? 15 A. I do see that. 16 Q. When did anyone from Norfolk 17 Southern -- well, let me ask it -- let me 18 withdraw that. 19 What evidence do you rely on in 20 making that allegation? 21 A. Looking at information from the 22 NTSB, both the Hazardous Materials Group 23 Chair Factual reports and again the FRA's 24 testimony concerning the investigative 25 hearing.|Page 361 1 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON: 2 Q. Okay. Which page do you want 3 to go to? 4 MS. PUJARI: If he could wait, 5 please. 6 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON: 7 Q. Which page, sir? 8 A. I think it would start at 9 630 -- 10 Q. Sure. 11 A. -- with Mr. Keltz. 12 Q. Okay. Okay. And I just 13 want -- I just want testimony about the 14 Trinity car. 15 Okay? 16 A. Okay. 17 Q. So tell me, what are the 18 specific discrepancies that Norfolk Southern 19 refers to in paragraph 120, subpart A. 20 A. Okay. As you can see, where 21 Mr. Keltz starts there on 630 and he says, 22 down at line 19 there on page 630, starting 23 with \"the TILX car.\" 24 If he said -- if you look at 25 this -- if you look at this document for|\nTILX402025, you can look down through here\nand see some discrepancies where when the\ncars have approvals. These are documented on\nwhat's called a certificate of construction.\nIt's an AAR form, industry-recognized AAR\nHe goes on to note, \"We looked\nat the drawings that were provided along with\nthe certificate of construction. We noticed\nthere was issues with the different revision\nlevels that were not captured on the\ncertificates of construction.\"\nAnd then he goes on to state,\nSo what happened, what happened is, there\nyou have -- you know, it's on this\ncertificate of construction. If it's an\noriginal, it is listing an original drawing,\nand the car is altered subsequently to the\napproval. And now -- and now it's, as you\nknow -- or as you know, now the information\nis being provided with a different revision\nlevel of drawings. There can be potential\nchanges to the cars that may make them unsafe\ndue to design criteria.\"\nSo he says, \"That's what we\npart of the car?\nA.   From here, I'm not sure. From\nMr. Keltz's testimony, he doesn't state the\nexact changes.\nQ.   Did they relate to valves,\nwheels, lining, pins, screws? Do you have\nany idea?\nA.   Again, just from Mr. Keltz's\ntestimony, I couldn't tell you. But let me\ntake a look and see if we've got anything\nfrom the Hazardous Materials Group Chair.\nMS. PUJARI: I believe it's\nExhibit 13.\nMR. SWANSON: It's Exhibit 13.\nMS. PUJARI: Do you have the\nwhole -- do you have the entire\nExhibit 13, Mr. Dixon?\nTHE WITNESS: Yes.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:\nQ.   Can you even tell me what part\nof the tank car these drawings or revisions\nrelated to, sir?\nMS. PUJARI: Objection.\nArgumentative.\nTHE WITNESS: Again, looking at\nPage 363 1 observed for this particular car. It was the 2 different revisions not captured on the 3 original 4-2 at the time of construction.\" 4 Q. Got it. 5 As the representative on behalf 6 of Norfolk Southern, is that the sum total of 7 Norfolk Southern's knowledge regarding the 8 so-called discrepancies between Car 26's 4-2 9 certificate and the tank car's actual 10 characteristics? 11 A. I would have to look again at 12 another one of the exhibits, Exhibit 10, the 13 Hazardous Materials Group, pages 33 14 through 38. 15 Q. Okay. You have that one in 16 front of you. 17 So what are the discrepancies 18 that you can tell me about based on this 19 exhibit? 20 A. As the FRA stated, there were 21 different revisions not captured on the 22 original 4-2. That was his summary, from 23 what I read of his testimony. 24 Q. Okay. What did the -- what did 25 the revisions or drawings relate to? What|Page 365 1 the Hazardous Material Group's report, 2 the -- the only other exhibit that I 3 would need to be able to see is to 4 check, again, the revisions that were 5 made. Because I'm assuming here in 6 its application to the AAR for renewal 7 of approval for valves and fittings 8 that were approved on 2019, they 9 referenced pressure relief valves A 10 37,000. And in -- it goes on to 11 describe the parts within the pressure 12 release valve. 13 So I'd have to look at the 14 original 4-2 to see what Mr. Keltz was 15 referring to, but I would assume that 16 some of the revisions that weren't 17 captured, adequately captured. 18 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON: 19 Q. Sir, I don't want your 20 assumption. Okay? Assumption doesn't do 21 anyone any good. I want to know Norfolk 22 Southern's knowledge. 23 You've made an allegation that 24 there were discrepancies between the 4-2 form 25 and the cars that existed. I want you to|\ntell me, if you can, what those discrepancies\nwere. If you can't tell me, you can say, I\ndon't know.\nOkay?\nA.   I'll leave those -- that to the\nexperts to review the 4-2.\nAgain, the FRA noted the\ndifferences, or the discrepancies, between\nthe revisions and the original certificate of\nconstruction.\nQ.   Okay. That's one you have to\nleave to the experts?\nA.   To look through the\nconstruction and the parts on the -- on the\ntank car, the pressure relief valves, the\nangle cock valves. I'm not an expert to\nquickly look at a AAR 4-2 and look at what\nthey stated was in the construction materials\nand tell you if there is any differences in\ndrawings or anything -21    Q.   We told you two weeks ago we\nwere going to ask you about that. We sent\nout a notice that said, make sure you can\ntestify about the discrepancies. And now\nyou're saying you got to leave that to the\nthird-party defendants' failure to follow\nfederal regulations and industry rules on the\ndesign, build, testing, modification and\nqualification of hazardous materials tank\ncars and their components.\"\nDid I read that correctly?\nA.   That's what's written there at\nQ.   Okay. And that's an allegation\nthat you've made, right?\nA.   That's an allegation that\nNorfolk Southern has made, but that is a\nlegal allegation with respect to that\nparagraph.\nQ.   Well, let's see.\nWhen you say \"failure to follow\nfederal regulations and industry rules,\"\nyou're referring back to the so-called\ndiscrepancies you can't identify.\nRight?\nMS. PUJARI: Objection.\nMisstates prior testimony and calls\nfor a legal conclusion.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:\nQ.   Correct, sir?\nPage 367 1 experts. You haven't seen the analysis. 2 Is that fair? 3 A. No. What I'm saying is, is I 4 can testify to the fact that I know from what 5 I've read, the FRA has taken exception to the 6 AAR Form 4-2 and what the actual 7 characteristics were on that railcar. 8 Q. Okay. I'm running out of time, 9 so let's turn to paragraph 153, please. 10 \"Norfolk Southern alleges the 11 damage and release of hazardous materials 12 from Car 26 was in part the result of 13 Trinity's failure to follow federal 14 regulations and industry rules on the design, 15 build, testing, modification and 16 qualification of hazardous material tank cars 17 and their components.\" 18 Did I read that right? 19 A. Can you tell me again what 20 paragraph you're on? 21 Q. I'm sorry, I thought you were 22 there. It's paragraph 153. 23 Try it again. \"The damage and 24 release of hazardous materials from Cars 26, 25 27, 28, 29 and 53 were in part the result of|Page 369 1 A. I'm saying that's a -- again, 2 part of the federal regulations that are set 3 for the design, building, testing, 4 modification. Those regulations are there, 5 and I would say, again, based off what we saw 6 from the FRA testimony, that there were 7 discrepancies between the actual physical 8 characteristics of the railcars at the time 9 of derailment and the original 4-2 10 certificate of construction. 11 Q. How do you claim that any of 12 those so-called discrepancies caused damage 13 and release of hazardous materials from 14 Car 26? 15 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Calls 16 for a legal conclusion. 17 THE WITNESS: Again, all I'm 18 looking at here from 153 is that it's 19 a -- as it reads -- 20 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON: 21 Q. I can read it. 22 A. Okay. 23 Q. I want to know, how did any 24 discrepancy that you claim existed cause the 25 damage and release of hazardous materials|\nfrom Car 26?\nMS. PUJARI: Objection. Calls",
  "for a legal conclusion.\nTHE WITNESS: Every -- again,\neverybody that is part of the supply\nchain, whether it's builders,\nshippers, transportation companies,\nthey all have a responsibility to\nfollow the federal guidelines that are\nput in place to ensure the safe\ntransportation of goods.\nIf that is not followed,\nthen -- again, the whole purpose of\nhaving that in place is to make sure\nthat safety is paramount.\nThe materials, or the damage\nand releases of hazardous materials",
  "from those cars, if responders at this\nsituation at that time, if they're\nlooking at information pertaining to\nthose railcars and making decisions\nbased off those railcars, then, again,\nthey're looking for everybody within\nthe supply chain to have made sure\nthat they're following all federal\nCorrect?\nMS. PUJARI: Objection.\nMisstates prior testimony.",
  "QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:\nQ.   Correct, sir?\nWhat else was it? It was the\nvent and burn, right?\nA.   The -9        MS. PUJARI: Objection. Asked",
  "and answered. Misstates prior\ntestimony.\nTHE WITNESS: So the release -13    the damage that occurred during the\ntime of the derailment to these cars.\nObviously they were all damaged to\nsome extent during the derailment.\nAs far as the release of\nhazardous materials, all of the\nchlorine cars, as they were venting,\nthe PRDs were releasing pression -21    releasing pressure, were releasing\nhazardous materials.\nSo I wouldn't agree with your\nstatement that the only reason you\nhave release of hazardous materials\nPage 371 1 regulations and industry rules. 2 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON: 3 Q. Let me ask it a different way. 4 The release of hazardous 5 materials from Car 26, that was due solely to 6 the vent and burn decision. 7 Right? 8 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Calls 9 for a legal conclusion and misstates 10 prior testimony. 11 You can answer, and then I 12 would ask that we take a break. We've 13 been going for about an hour. 14 MR. SWANSON: All right. I'll 15 finish this line, and then we can take 16 a break. 17 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON: 18 Q. Correct, sir? 19 A. The vent and burn, again, was a 20 decision for all five of these railcars to 21 mitigate the known risks at that time. 22 Q. Right. 23 But when you refer to the 24 release of hazardous materials from Car 26, 25 that was the result of the vent and burn.|Page 373 1 from all these cars is simply the vent 2 and burn. 3 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON: 4 Q. But when the vent and burn 5 decision was made, February 5, 2023, no one 6 at Norfolk Southern was even aware that there 7 were any discrepancies between the AAR 8 Form 4-2 and the Car 26 as it existed at the 9 time. 10 Correct? 11 A. Again, as I testified before, 12 I'm not aware of anybody at Norfolk Southern 13 knowing there was discrepancies between the 14 actual characteristics and the certificate of 15 construction. 16 MR. SWANSON: Okay. We can 17 take a break now. 18 MS. PUJARI: Mr. Swanson, 19 you've been going for an hour. 20 Are you receiving time from 21 someone else? Otherwise, I think your 22 time is up. 23 MR. SWANSON: You can think 24 what you want. We'll take a break, if 25 you want a break, and then we can|\ndiscuss how we're going to allocate\nour time.\nMS. PUJARI: I believe there's\nonly, what, how many minutes left?\nMR. SWANSON: There's at least\nMS. PUJARI: Can we get -8        MR. DENTON: 21 or more.\nVIDEOGRAPHER: 5:03 {sic}, we\nare off the video record.\nOff the record at 6:03 p.m.)\nVIDEOGRAPHER: 6:19, we are on\nthe video record.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:\nQ.   Okay. Mr. Dixon, just a few\nremaining questions on this issue of these\nso-called discrepancies in the AAR 4-2 forms\nand how, if at all, they could have caused an\ninjury to Norfolk Southern.\nYou mentioned that these\ndiscrepancies were identified by the FRA.\nRight?\nA.   Yes, I did.\nQ.   Okay. And that's the Federal\nRailroad Administration?\nQ.   And if you turn in that\nexhibit, it's -- they're little tiny pages\ncalled minu-script pages. I want to turn to\npage 636, which is in the Bates number that\nends 344.\nAre you there on 636?\nA.   I am there.\nQ.   Okay. And as you said,\nMr. Keltz had testified about these equipment\napproval deficiencies that we've been talking\nabout.\nRight?\nA.   Yes.\nQ.   And that's a testimony of his\nthat you read.\nTrue?\nA.   That's true.\nQ.   Now, Mr. Lynum, one of the\nfolks with NTSB who was asking questions,\npicked up on this testimony from Mr. Keltz,\nand he asked him about it. And I want to\nread from that testimony at 636.\nOkay?\nDo you see on line 9 where\nMr. Lynum asks Mr. Keltz:\nPage 375 1 A. That's correct. 2 Q. And you referenced some 3 testimony from a Mr. Keltz, who's a 4 representative of the FRA. 5 Right? 6 A. Yes, I did. 7 Q. And you've read his testimony? 8 A. I read a piece of his 9 testimony. 10 Q. Okay. 11 A. Yes, sir. 12 Q. But he's somebody who looked 13 into these discrepancies, and you relied on 14 his testimony in giving your answers. 15 Right? In part? 16 A. In part. And again, reading 17 his testimony was -- yes, that's what 18 occurred. 19 Q. Okay. I want to look at 20 another piece of Mr. Keltz's testimony. This 21 is from Exhibit 29, which is the transcript 22 of investigative hearing, day 2, June 23rd of 23 2023. 24 Okay? 25 A. Okay.|Page 377 1 \"Would any of the equipment 2 approval deficiencies you noted lead to 3 tank car safety or performance 4 problems?\" 5 Do you see that? 6 A. I see that. 7 Q. And Mr. Keltz testifies: 8 \"That, we don't know because, 9 you know, we're not the group that does 10 the approvals. That's -- you know, the 11 approvals are done through the AAR and 12 the tank car committee approval 13 process, and where they use a third 14 party, you know, subject matter expert 15 to do an engineering analysis on those. 16 \"So we at FRA, we don't have no 17 way of knowing if there was anything 18 there that would potentially negatively 19 impact these cars as they were in 20 transportation.\" 21 Did I read that correctly, sir? 22 A. That is what's in the 23 transcript. You read it correctly. 24 Q. So is it your understanding 25 that when the representative of FRA was asked|\nwhether these so-called deficiencies or\ndiscrepancies could have affected the safety\nor performance of the trains, train cars, his\nresponse was, we at FRA, we don't know.\nRight?\nA.   That was Mr. Keltz's testimony.\nQ.   What is it that Norfolk\nSouthern knows that the FRA doesn't know when\nit makes the allegation that these\ndeficiencies or discrepancies somehow caused\ninjury to Norfolk Southern?\nMS. PUJARI: Objection.\nMischaracterizes Mr. Keltz's entire\ntestimony and the complaint.\nTHE WITNESS: Yeah, the -- what\nI had read was, again, Mr. Kultz -17    Mr. Keltz, FR -- from the FRA, his\ntestimony on the discrepancies noted\nbetween the actual characteristics of\nthe tank car and that of on the form\nAAR 4-2.\nWhat you just pointed out here\nis someone questioning Mr. Keltz on\nhow does that impact the -- what did\nyou say here -\nMy question was pretty simple.\nMr. Keltz at the FRA, the guy whose testimony\nyou relied on for your allegation -- for\nNorfolk Southern's allegation that there were\ndiscrepancies between the AAR form and the\nCar 26, right, Mr. Keltz -7    A.   Yes.\nQ.   -- he was asked whether any of\nthose discrepancies affected car safety or\nperformance.\nAnd his response was, \"That, we\ndon't know.\"\nCorrect?\nMS. PUJARI: Objection.",
  "Mischaracterizes Mr. Keltz's entire\ntestimony.\nTHE WITNESS: Mr. Keltz\nresponds that he doesn't know because,\nagain, he's not the one who is the\nexpert on the actual approvals.\nWhat I quoted, again, from the\ntest -- the hearing testimony was\nMr. Keltz's review of the actual\ncharacteristics of the tank car,\ncomparing it to the certificate of\nPage 379 1 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON: 2 Q. Safety or performance. 3 A. Safety or performance. Tank 4 car safety or performance problems. Lead to. 5 And Mr. Keltz's testimony is, I 6 don't know. 7 Again, the FRA is not 8 responsible for approving the AAR Form 4-2. 9 What they are responsible for is ensuring 10 people are following federal guidelines with 11 respect to -- with respect to all the 12 regulations that go into car construction, 13 maintenance, inspection, the whole nine 14 yards. 15 The FRA, as you probably are 16 well aware, has different -- different areas. 17 They're broken down into operational issues. 18 And obviously Mr. Keltz, on his 19 FRA team, is one of those individuals looking 20 into compliance with respect to, again, 21 making sure that all appropriate changes or 22 revisions in the initial constructions are 23 documented and therefore match the actual 24 characteristics of the railcars. 25 Q. Right.|Page 381 1 construction, or, if there's a 2 revision that's been done, comparing 3 it to the revision to make sure, 4 again, everybody's in compliance with 5 federal regulations. 6 That's -- that was my statement 7 concerning why we noted the NTSB 8 investigative hearing transcripts, not 9 for whether or not the FRA is the 10 individual to make a determination on 11 the impact on safety. 12 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON: 13 Q. If you can turn, please -- 14 thank you, I'm done with -- I'm done with 15 that topic. Just a couple of further topics 16 I want to hit on briefly. 17 Look at Exhibit 4, please. 18 Looking at paragraph 99 -- 19 A. Give me a second. I'm trying 20 to -- 21 Q. I know. You've got a lot of 22 materials. 23 Are you at paragraph 99? 24 A. No, I'm not. 25 Q. No. Page 21.|\nMS. PUJARI: Counsel -- hold on",
  "a sec.\nMR. SWANSON: What?",
  "MS. PUJARI: Withdrawn.\nQUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:\nQ.   Are you there?\nA.   I'm on page 21, and then can\nyou remind me again of the paragraph?",
  "Q.   Yeah, it's the last paragraph\nthere, paragraph 99.\nA.   Yes, I'm there.\nQ.   It says, \"During the vent and\nburn, video footage reportedly identified\npure polymer, indicating a polymerization\nreaction releasing from two of the vinyl\nchloride tank cars.\"\nWhat video is that?",
  "A.   I don't know. I'd have to\nrefresh myself on the NTSB investigative\nhearing, day 1.\nQ.   Well, have you ever seen the\nvideo?\nA.   Actually, I'm not sure.\nQ.   Do you know if a video even\nexists?\nQUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:\nQ.   Are you saying if we look at",
  "those exhibits we'll see the video, or we'll\nsee somebody saying, I saw a video?\nA.   You'll see the video of it.\nAnd again, if you go back to the\ninvestigative transcripts {sic} hearing,\nthat's where I think we'll get the statements\nthat it was viewed.\nQ.   I don't want the statements. I\nwant the video. My only question is whether\nyou know if there's a video or not. If you",
  "don't, you don't know. That's okay.\nMS. PUJARI: Objection. Asked",
  "and answered.\nTHE WITNESS: As I've stated\nbefore, I believe there's a video.\nIt's referenced.",
  "QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:\nQ.   Okay. All right.\nParagraph 135. I think this is the last\nquestion I'll have. The last topic. It's on\npage 27.\nYou see there it begins, \"Upon\ninformation and belief\"?\nPage 383 1 A. I would say the video exists, 2 because it's noted. 3 Q. Well, but that -- see, I was a 4 little confused by the way that Norfolk 5 Southern phrased this. 6 It says, \"Video footage 7 reportedly identified pure polymer.\" And I 8 would think if someone had watched that 9 video, you would say, video footage 10 identified pure polymer. 11 That's the reason for my 12 question. 13 Do you know if a video even 14 exists? 15 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Asked 16 and answered. 17 THE WITNESS: Like I said 18 before, if it's noted here, it exists. 19 And if we could take a look at 20 Group B, Exhibit 10, in the NTSB 21 investigative hearing transcripts, I'm 22 sure it'll state just that, that a 23 video was reviewed and reportedly 24 identified pure polymer, indicating a 25 polymerization reaction.|Page 385 1 A. Yes, I see that. 2 Q. Okay. \"Upon information and 3 belief, in the aftermath of the derailment 4 and vent and burn, aluminum and copper were 5 found in the vinyl chloride tank cars.\" 6 Subparagraph A says, 7 \"Car 26\" -- and that's the Trinity car, 8 right? -- \"had aluminum found in samples of 9 the interior surface of the manway nozzle and 10 aluminum coating on the PRD springs.\" 11 Did I read that right? 12 A. You read that right. 13 Q. Okay. What is -- what 14 documents or evidence do you rely on in 15 making that statement? 16 A. For that I relied on -- or we 17 relied on the Hazardous Materials Group Chair 18 Factual Report. 19 Q. Okay. And is that at pages 28 20 and 62? 21 A. I'd have to look at those pages 22 to see if this is in reference to the Car 26, 23 but... 24 Q. So I'm looking at page 28 of 25 Exhibit 13, the bottom paragraph that you're|\nreferring to?\nA.   Yes. That's one of the\naluminum, 1 to 2.8 percent, was found in four\nsamples collected from TILX402025 interior\nsurface and manway nozzle.\nQ.   Before this post-derailment\ntank car sampling analysis was done, did\nNorfolk Southern know that the PRD spring in\nCar 402025 had an aluminum -- used an\naluminum spring?\nA.   I would have no way of knowing.\nMR. SWANSON: Okay. Those are\nthe questions that I have. Thank you,\nsir. I don't know if anyone else is\ngoing to pick up or not.\nMS. BROZ: How much time is\nthere? Can we go off the record?\nVIDEOGRAPHER: 6:33, we are off\nthe video record.\nOff the record at 6:33 p.m.)\nVIDEOGRAPHER: 6:38, we are on\nthe video record.\nRECROSS-EXAMINATION\nQUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:\nQ.   Mr. Dixon, just one more\nQ.   Okay. So between February 3rd\nand February 6th, the day that you vent and\nburn the cars, was a total three days.\nCorrect?\nA.   That equates to three days.\nQ.   So generously, the vent and\nburn process took a total of three days.\nIsn't that right?\nA.   The vent and burn product -10 the vent and burn did not take three days\nfrom -- to actually vent and burn.\nI guess I'm questioning what -13 could you repeat that question with respect\nto the time you're referring to?\nWhen you say \"the time it took\nto vent and burn\" -17    Q.   Okay. Let's just cut this\nshort.\nIs it your testimony that it\nwould have been quicker to transfer the\nproduct than to vent and burn the cars?",
  "MS. PUJARI: Objection. Asked\nand answered.\nQUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:\nQ.   Yes or no?\nPage 387 1 question. 2 I believe you testified earlier 3 that transferring the vinyl chloride product 4 would have been faster than the vent and 5 burn? 6 A. The question -- 7 Q. Is that correct? Did you 8 testify to that earlier? 9 A. I testified that if we were 10 looking for just speed to fix the situation, 11 yes, a transfer of product would have been 12 more efficient and sped up everything, rather 13 than a vent and burn. 14 Q. Would it have taken less time? 15 A. It should have, yes. If 16 everything was in good condition, I think 17 that it would have taken less time overall. 18 The actual vent and burn 19 process itself is -- obviously doesn't take a 20 whole a lot of time with respect to comparing 21 that to transferring product. 22 But everything associated with 23 the vent and burn, yeah, the most -- the most 24 efficient piece would have been to transfer 25 the product.|Page 389 1 A. Yes, if you could -- if we 2 could have transferred the product, that 3 means we could have moved and gotten close to 4 those railcars. All of those components 5 would have been in good shape. We would have 6 moved those cars out to an area where we 7 could have just transferred the product to 8 another -- whether it's a truck, a vehicle, 9 whatever it was. But that would have been 10 the fastest thing if we wanted to just get 11 that material that was there out. 12 But that's not -- 13 Q. Can we pull up -- 14 A. -- the case. 15 Q. -- the transcript from day 1? 16 This is from day 1 of the NTSB 17 hearing? If we can go to the bottom of that 18 page. 19 Let's go off. That's not the 20 right page, I think. It's the wrong page 21 number. 22 Can you go to the bottom of 23 that page? 24 A. I don't have a copy of day 1 25 transcript of investigative hearing.|\nQ.   All right. Since we're short\non time, Mr. McCarty testified at day 1 of\nthe -4        MS. PUJARI: I'm sorry, what\nexhibit is this?\nMS. BROZ: We haven't marked an\nexhibit. I'm reading it from the\ntranscript.\nMS. PUJARI: Okay. We're going\nto need more context than this. We\nhave this tiny little snippet.\nMS. BROZ: I'm reading you the\ncontext, if you let me continue with\nmy question.\nMS. PUJARI: Well, we'd like\nthe entire document, please.\nMS. BROZ: It's day 1 from the\nNTSB transcript -19        MS. PUJARI: Which we do not\nhave. We do not have that in front of\nus.\nSo I'm going to object to this\nbecause we cannot see what comes\nbefore -25        MS. BROZ: That's fine.\ninitiation, it should be done anywhere\nfrom approximately four to six hours.\"\nMr. Cassity: Okay. Thank\nyou.\"\nDid Norfolk Southern vent and\nburn these railcars because it was a quicker\nway and an easier way to get their rails back\nup in operation instead of actually removing\nthe liquid from the cars, which would have\ntaken an additional five days?"
