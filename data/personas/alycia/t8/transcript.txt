4
5        DIRECT EXAMINATION
6 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:
7    Q.   All right. Good morning,
8 Mr. Dixon.
9    A.   Good morning.
10    Q.   My name is Roger Denton. I
11 think we shook hands briefly before the
12 deposition. I represent the group of
13 residents in East Palestine involving the
14 Norfolk Southern train derailment that
15 happened on February 3, 2023.
16        Do you understand that?
17    A.   I do.
18    Q.   Okay. We served a notice of
19 deposition on Norfolk Southern and requested
20 that they provide a witness to testify on
21 behalf of the corporation, that would be the
22 Norfolk Southern Railway and the Norfolk
23 Southern corporation, concerning certain
24 topics that were in our notice of deposition.
25 And you're the person that they have


1    Pamphlet 171; Vinyl Chloride Monomer
2    Tank Car & Car {sic} Tank Handling
3    Manual; the NTB docket Group B,
4    Exhibit 26, vinyl chloride monomer
5    safety data sheet.
6        I reviewed the disaster story
7    at Kingman, Arizona, historic
8    district; The Southern Boulevard Fire:
9    Kansas City Remembers a Tragedy in the
10    F i r e h o u s e .
11        The NTB docket Group B,
12    Exhibit 10, hazardous group chair
13    factual report.
14        The NTB docket for the
15    operations factual report.
16        And the NTB docket for the
17    mechanical factual report.
18        And then the NTB docket group F
19    for -- the exhibits for the
20    application, approval of certificates
21    of construction, Exhibits 29, 30, 31,
23        Also a document in the matter
24    of East Palestine Train Derailment
25    site, East Palestine, Columbiana
|Page 11 1 d e s ig n a t e d . 2 Do you understand that, sir? 3 A. I do. 4 Q. Okay. Before you came in here 5 to give a deposition, did you review any 6 documents, videos, photographs? 7 A. Yes. 8 Q. Could you tell me what you 9 reviewed, please? 10 A. I reviewed the NTSB, the 11 dockets Group B exhibits. I reviewed the 12 NTSB investigative hearing transcripts, day 1 13 and day 2. The air brake inspection and test 14 certificates on TRRA. 15 MS. PUJARI: While you're 16 taking a minute, Mr. Dixon, just be 17 sure to keep your voice up so that the 18 court reporter can hear you and the 19 video is clear and counsel can hear 20 you. 21 THE WITNESS: Okay. 22 All right. So as I said, the 23 NTSB investigative hearing transcripts 24 day 1 and day 2; the Chlorine 25 Institute and Vinyl Institute|Page 13 1 County, Ohio, EPA unilateral 2 administrative order. 3 And Norfolk Southern's third 4 quarter 2023 results. 5 Also, 49 CFR 179.3, CFR -- 6 well, 49 CFR 179.6; 49 CFR 180.507(a), 7 49 CFR 180.417(a). 8 And then I didn't repeat -- if 9 I didn't state this, the NTSB docket 10 group F, Exhibit 49; NTSB docket 11 group, Exhibit 30; NTSB docket 12 Group B, Exhibit 10, and then NTBS 13 {sic} docket F, Exhibit 31; NTBS -- 14 NTSB docket group F, Exhibit 32; NTSB 15 docket Group B, Exhibit 10. 16 And I believe that concludes 17 the material. 18 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 19 Q. Okay. Thank you, sir. 20 You're referring to a document 21 that you were just, I don't want to say 22 reading from, but referring to to answer that 23 last question. 24 True? 25 A. Yes, that's true.|

1        MR. DENTON: Could we mark
2    that, Carrie, please, as Exhibit 1?
3        Do we have another copy of that
4    for counsel? Thank you.
5        (Dixon 30(b)(6) Exhibit 1
6    marked for identification.)
7 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:
8    Q.   So Exhibit 1, Mr. Dixon, I've
9 been handed a copy, which you have right
10 there. I assume that was prepared for you in
11 anticipation of this litigation -- or this
12 d e p o s i t i o n ?
13    A.   Yes.
14    Q.   Okay. I guess a better
15 question, you did not prepare that document,
16 t r u e ?
17    A.   I did not prepare this
18 d o c u m e n t .
19    Q.   Okay. The other document you
20 have over there to your right, that one-page
21 document, it looks like, could you tell us
22 what that is, please?
23    A.   These -- this is a list of
24 vinyl chloride and polyethylene tank cars
25 that were part of the 30(b)(6) -- part of the


1    Q.   And then I'll just -- 28 is
2 another OCPX, 80179, vinyl chloride, true?
3    A.   Correct.
4    Q.   Car Number 29 was GATX95098,
5 loaded with vinyl chloride.
6        Correct?
7    A.   Correct.
8    Q.   And then Car 53, an OCPX80370,
9 was loaded with vinyl chloride.
10        Correct?
11    A.   Correct.
12    Q.   Okay. So in addition to
13 reviewing the documents that you told us
14 about earlier, what else, if anything, did
15 you do to prepare for this deposition here
16 today?
17    A.   I took a look at the Norfolk
18 Southern operating rules and, excuse me, and
19 the Norfolk Southern NS-1 rules.
20    Q.   NS what, sir?
21    A.   NS-1 rules.
22    Q.   Okay. Other than lawyers, did
23 you talk to anyone at N S in preparation for
24 this deposition to try to get some factual
25 information?
|Page 15 1 32N consist and part of this deposition. 2 (Dixon 30(b)(6) Exhibit 2 3 marked for identification.) 4 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 5 Q. Okay. Let's mark that as 6 Exhibit 2, please. 7 Looks like it's -- Exhibit 2 8 appears to be a listing of five or six 9 different railcars that were in Train 32N 10 that derailed in East Palestine, correct? 11 A. That's correct. 12 Q. Okay. It's the Car Number 23, 13 the GPLX75465, which was a hopper car that 14 had plastic pellets in it. 15 Correct? 16 A. Correct. 17 Q. And then there's Car 26, which 18 is TILX402025, which was loaded with vinyl 19 chloride at the time of the derailment. 20 True? 21 A. Correct. 22 Q. Car 27, OCPX80235, again, a car 23 loaded with vinyl chloride. 24 True? 25 A. Correct.|Page 17 1 A. I had a conversation with 2 Dianne Barnett, who is in our mechanical 3 department, because I had a question about 4 one of the hot box detector alerts. 5 And another hot box detector 6 alert that appeared when I read the documents 7 appeared to say the same thing. 8 Q. Uh-huh. 9 A. So I did ask what the 10 difference between those two alerts were. 11 Q. Okay. Did you talk to any 12 other Norfolk Southern employee to gather 13 information or facts or explanations for 14 preparation for this deposition? 15 A. In reviewing the 2020 emergency 16 response guide, I did not know if that was 17 the latest, the greatest, and I did not know 18 if that was -- again, if it wasn't the 19 latest, I wanted to make sure we were looking 20 at the right emergency response guide. 21 So I spoke with Robert Wood at 22 Norfolk Southern, who confirmed that it was 23 the latest issue from PHMSA, the Department 24 of Transportation. 25 Q. Okay. And what is Robert|
|---|---|


-----

1 Wood's position with Norfolk Southern?
2    A.   He works in our HAZMAT area.
3    Q.   Hazardous materials?
4    A.   Hazardous materials.
5    Q.   Okay. And, Mr. Dixon, your
6 background at Norfolk Southern, what job do
7 you have for them, sir?
8    A.   I am currently the director of
9 labor relations, and I work with our
10 operations group to analyze train and engine
11 p r o d u c t i v i t y .
12    Q.   Say that again? I'm sorry.
13 I'm having a little trouble hearing.
14    A.   I currently work as a director
15 of labor relations -16    Q.   Okay.
17    A.   -- in our labor relations
18 department, where I'm in charge of working
19 with others in operations to measure train
20 and engine productivity and ensure we have
21 proper staffing on the railway.
22    Q.   Okay. So you're involved with
23 trying to get the trains moving efficiently?
24    A.   I'm involved with resource
25 s t a f f i n g .


1        Like the one that derailed in
2 East Palestine on February 3, 2023, that's a
3 through-freight train. Have you ever
4 operated one of those as a conductor or
5 worked on one as a conductor?
6    A.   No, not as a conductor.
7    Q.   Okay. Did you talk to the
8 lawyers, meet with the lawyers, to prepare?
9        I don't want to know what you
10 talked about, but you can tell me how many
11 times did you meet with lawyers and how long
12 did you spend preparing for your deposition.
13 Don't tell me what you talked about. Just
14 tell me time.
15        MS. PUJARI: Objection to the
16    extent it calls for privileged
17    information.
18        You can answer, but not as to
19    any content.
20        THE WITNESS: I believe we met
21    on four occasions, and I believe the
22    longest of those four was up to four
23    hours. Most of them two.
24 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:
25    Q.   So four different meetings with
|Page 19 1 Q. Resource staffing from a labor 2 relations point of view? 3 A. From a labor relations point of 4 view -- 5 Q. All right. 6 A. -- yes, sir. 7 Q. Have you ever worked in 8 railroad operations, actually as a trainman 9 or a conductor or a carman, like that, a 10 union craft job? 11 A. I've never been in a union 12 craft job. I've been a certified conductor 13 when I worked in our transportation 14 operations department. 15 Q. Were you actually working on 16 trains, or were you in the office? 17 A. I was working in the field. 18 Q. Doing what? 19 A. I held a position of 20 superintendent of terminals at Chattanooga, 21 Tennessee, as well as the assistant division 22 superintendent on our central division. 23 Q. Okay. But did you actually 24 work as a conductor on a freight train going 25 across the country?|Page 21 1 lawyers. You estimate somewhere between two 2 and four hours for each meeting? 3 A. That's correct. 4 Q. Okay. Where were those 5 meetings held, sir? 6 A. I think two were online. Two 7 were in person. 8 Q. Okay. And where were the 9 in-person ones handled? 10 A. One in Atlanta, Georgia, at our 11 corporate office. 12 Q. Okay. And where was the other 13 one? 14 A. Here in this building. 15 Q. In DC at the WilmerHale law 16 firm? 17 A. Yes, sir. 18 Q. The lawyers that represent 19 Norfolk Southern in this litigation, correct? 20 A. Correct. 21 (Dixon 30(b)(6) Exhibit 3 22 marked for identification.) 23 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 24 Q. Okay. So I want to display -- 25 let's mark this as Exhibit 3, the deposition|
|---|---|


-----

1 n o t i c e .
2        Okay. Have you seen this
3 before, sir, Exhibit 3, the deposition
4 notice, that brought you here today?
5    A.   Yes, sir.
6    Q.   Okay. And if we go to page 2
7 of that document, it refers to various
8 allegations that were made in a lawsuit that
9 Norfolk Southern filed against third parties
10 and -- in this derailment case, the East
11 Palestine derailment case, and references
12 certain paragraphs in that pleading that the
13 railroad filed.
14        C o r r e c t ?
15    A.   Yes, it appears to do just
16 t h a t .
17    Q.   Okay. And it looks like your
18 Exhibit 1, this document where you talked
19 about all that, it looks like the lawyers or
20 somebody -- strike that.
21        It looks like somebody took
22 those paragraphs and provided those for you
23 from the notice.
24        C o r r e c t ?
25    A.   Yes, sir.


1 it for you.
2    A.   Yes.
3    Q.   Okay. And that's -- on this
4 Exhibit 1 that you brought with you is the
5 first paragraph that's on that document as
6 w e l l .
7        C o r r e c t ?
8    A.   Correct.
9    Q.   Okay. So let's read this
10 together so the jurors understand what we're
11 talking about.
12        It says, quote, "The train was
13 assembled in Madison, Illinois, and was
14 destined for Conway, Pennsylvania. On
15 February 1, 2023, in Madison, a qualified
16 mechanical inspector conducted a mechanical
17 inspection and an air brake test," period,
18 end quote.
19        Do you see that?
20    A.   I do.
21    Q.   Okay. And then I want to ask
22 you about that information.
23        But before -- and you've listed
24 a number of documents on your Exhibit 1 that
25 relate to answering that question.
|Page 23 1 Q. Okay. All right. So and 2 you're ready to talk about these today on 3 behalf of both corporations, both Norfolk 4 Southern corporations? 5 A. Correct. 6 (Dixon 30(b)(6) Exhibit 4 7 marked for identification.) 8 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 9 Q. Okay. Let's start with the 10 very first paragraph. Let's pull up the 11 third-party complaint, please. We'll mark 12 that as 4. 13 And let's go to paragraph 29 on 14 page 8 of the third-party complaint. It's 15 the very first paragraph that's in the 16 notice, and it's in the document that was 17 provided for you to be prepared for. 18 Do you see that? Very first 19 o n e . 20 A. Can you repeat what page? 21 Q. I've got page 8 of the 22 third-party complaint. 23 A. Okay. 24 Q. And I think paragraph 29 is 25 right at the top, and I think I highlighted|Page 25 1 Right? 2 A. That's correct. 3 Q. Okay. You still have that, 4 don't you, in front of you, Exhibit 1? 5 A. I do. 6 Q. You mentioned the NTSB docket 7 Group B, Exhibit 5; the ALS TRRA 31 consist; 8 NTSB docket Group B, Exhibit 6 and 10; 9 hearing transcript day 1 at page 27; and the 10 air brake inspection and test certificate 11 from TRRA. 12 And TRRA is the Terminal 13 Railroad Association St. Louis. 14 C o r r e c t ? 15 A. That's correct. 16 Q. And do you know anything about 17 that railroad? 18 A. Not a lot, no. 19 Q. What little do you know about 20 t h e m ? 21 A. I know it's a terminal 22 switching rail service. 23 Q. Okay. So they're in the 24 St. Louis area. They do local switching, 25 interchange with big carriers like NS, right?|
|---|---|


-----

1    A.   That's correct.
2    Q.   Okay. I think they're a
3 Class III railroad, aren't they?
4    A.   I'm not positive on that.
5    Q.   Okay. Certainly not a Class I
6 r a i l r o a d ?
7    A.   That's correct.
8    Q.   Okay. All right. So when we
9 talk about a, quote -- can we underline that,
10 Michael? -- quote, "qualified mechanical
11 inspector" paragraph?  Yeah.
12        That means something under the
13 FRA regulations, doesn't it, sir?
14    A.   Yes.
15    Q.   Okay. And that regulation is
16 governed by 49 CFR 215, right?
17    A.   Correct.
18        (Dixon 30(b)(6) Exhibit 5
19    marked for identification.)
20 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:
21    Q.   Can we pull that up, please?
22 Because I don't see that on your list here of
23 what you reviewed, and I just want to make
24 sure we get through this correctly.
25        Are we on Exhibit 4, Carrie?


1 with -- well, read the title. "Designated
2 i n s p e c t o r . "
3        That's what you're -- what is
4 being referred to in paragraph 29 of this
5 third-party complaint, is this is the
6 qualified mechanical inspector, correct?
7 This defines what they are?
8        MS. PUJARI: Objection as to
9    the document stating "designated
10    inspector." It's in the complaint
11    stating "qualified inspector."
12    Misstates the document.
13        MR. DENTON: Okay.
14 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:
15    Q.   Is there any other section in
16 the Federal Code of Regulations that define a
17 qualified mechanical inspector for railcars
18 other than 215.11?
19    A.   I don't know.
20    Q.   Well, you're here on behalf of
21 the Norfolk Southern Railway speaking for the
22 c o r p o r a t i o n .
23        Are you telling me the
24 corporation doesn't know the answer to that
25 q u e s t i o n ?
|Page 27 1 5 . 2 Have you -- you've looked at 3 this in the past, haven't you, sir, Part 215 4 of the Railroad Freight Car Safety Standards? 5 A. I'm not familiar with the whole 6 Part 215. 7 Q. Okay. But you do understand 8 it's the regulations that govern freight car 9 safety standards? 10 A. It's part of the regulations. 11 Q. Right. Okay. 12 But when we talk about a 13 certified mechanical -- or qualified 14 mechanical inspector, that's defined in these 15 regulations, isn't it, sir? 16 A. Yes, sir. 17 Q. Let's go to -- I think it's 18 actually right there, 215.11, Designated 19 in s p e c t o r s . 20 Are you following me, sir? 21 A. I'm not there yet. 22 Q. Okay. Are you with me now? 23 A. I am. 24 Q. Okay. And this is the 25 section -- and if we read it, starting|Page 29 1 A. I know that the FRA, who is 2 responsible for governance of railcar 3 operations, mechanical activities, as stated, 4 if we look at the NTB investigative hearing 5 transcript, day 1 -- 6 Q. Yeah. 7 A. -- page 7 -- 8 Q. Right. 9 A. -- that the cars were inspected 10 by -- at the TRA -- TRRA by a mechanical 11 qualified inspector. 12 Q. Well, I'm going to test you on 13 that, sir, because I don't believe that to be 14 the case. That's what we're here for today. 15 Okay? Are you ready to go? 16 A. Sure. 17 Q. Okay. Because you're not here 18 to testify on behalf of the NTSB. You're 19 here to testify on behalf of Norfolk Southern 20 Railway Company, the knowledge of the 21 railroad, correct? 22 A. Correct. 23 Q. Okay. So let's look at what 24 the regulations defined as a qualified -- or 25 a designated, quote -- sorry, designated|

1 i n s p e c t o r .
2        "A, each railroad that operates
3 a railroad freight car to which this part
4 applies shall designate persons qualified to
5 inspect railroad freight cars for compliance
6 with this part to make the determinations
7 required by 215.9 of this part."
8        Right?  Follow me?
9    A.   That's what it states.
10    Q.   Okay. It goes down -- it goes
11 on in B. "Each person designated under this
12 section shall have demonstrated to the
13 railroad a knowledge and ability to inspect
14 the railroad freight cars for compliance with
15 the requirements of this part and to make the
16 determinations required by 215.9."
17        C o r r e c t ?
18    A.   Correct.
19    Q.   Okay. Let's look at all the
20 things that a qualified inspector under 215
21 is supposed to look at.
22        Let's go to the next set.
23 Let's go to Section 215.103.
24        Are you with me?
25    A.   215.103.


1        But you have to -- that's part
2 of what the inspection is required by the
3 qualified mechanical inspection, right?
4    A.   According to 215.105, yes.
5    Q.   Okay. Let's go to 215.107,
6 "Defective plain bearing box: General."
7        What is a plain bearing box?
8    A.   Give me a second to read what
9 they stated here.
10        I believe they're referring to
11 the housing of the bearing.
12    Q.   Right.
13        And one of the things is to
14 make sure it's visible, free of oil, right?
15 Under A?
16    A.   Yes, free of oil.
17    Q.   And we'll skip 215.09 just to
18 move on to 215.111, "Defective plain
19 b e a r i n g . "
20        Do you know what a plain
21 bearing is?
22    A.   I assume it's just a bearing.
23    Q.   Just a bearing.
24        Okay. Let's go down to
25 215.115, "Defective roller bearing."
|Page 31 1 Q. Right. 2 "Defective wheels." 3 C o r r e c t ? 4 A. Correct. 5 Q. It lists a lot of information 6 as to what the inspector is supposed to look 7 for on each railcar. Talks about wheel 8 flanges in paragraph A. Talks about wheel 9 flanges in paragraph B, thickness of the rim, 10 et cetera, a lot of information. Whether the 11 wheel is loose, down in paragraph G, whether 12 there's oil leaking from the wheels. 13 Do you see that? 14 A. I do. 15 Q. All right. In addition to that 16 in 215.105, a qualified inspection requires 17 that you look for defective axles. 18 R ig h t ? 19 A. Correct. 20 Q. What is an axle, sir; do you 21 k n o w ? 22 A. The axle attaches the two rail 23 wheels. It comes as a wheel set. 24 Q. Okay. We've got pictures of 25 that. We'll look at that later.|Page 33 1 Okay. That's what caused the 2 derailment here in East Palestine, was a 3 defective roller bearing, correct? 4 A. I don't believe that the actual 5 investigation has been finalized at this 6 point, so -- 7 Q. What is the position of the 8 Norfolk Southern Railway Company, sir? Did 9 or did not a defective roller bearing cause 10 this derailment? 11 A. I believe that we're in support 12 of the investigation to determine the cause. 13 Q. We're nine months out. 14 Are you telling me that Norfolk 15 Southern Railway Company doesn't know that a 16 defective roller bearing caused this 17 d e r a i lm e n t ? 18 A. I would assume that the -- that 19 the company would assume that the roller 20 bearing, the defective roller bearing, 21 resulted in the derailment of Car 23. 22 Q. Okay. Thank you. 23 And then back to 215.115. 24 That's one of the many things that a 25 qualified inspection is supposed to review,|

1 and let's go through it.
2        Part A, "A railroad may not
3 place or continue in service a car that has a
4 roller bearing that shows signs of being
5 overheated as evidenced by: discoloration."
6        Right?
7    A.   Right.
8    Q.   "Or telltale signs of
9 overheating, such as damage to the seal or
10 distortion of any bearing component."
11        Right?
12        MS. PUJARI: Counsel, I'm going
13    to object to the characterization of
14    the document as requiring an
15    inspection under this section as
16    opposed to a prohibition on placing
17    this component into service.
18        MR. DENTON: Well, let's go
19    back to...
20 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:
21    Q.   Let's go back to 215.11.
22        "A railroad" -- I'm sorry, sir,
23 you're not there yet.
24    A.   I'm not.
25    Q.   "A railroad may not place or


1    A.   I do.
2    Q.   All right. And if we go back
3 to 215.15, one of the sections under that
4 part is that a railroad may not place or
5 continue in service if the car has a roller
6 bearing that shows signs of being overheated,
7 et cetera.
8        C o r r e c t ?
9        MS. PUJARI: Counsel, which -10        MR. DENTON:  215.115.
11        THE WITNESS:  Correct.
12 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:
13    Q.   Okay. So let's go back to
14 paragraph 29, and let's talk about whether
15 Norfolk Southern performed this inspection of
16 the railcars and train in Madison, Illinois.
17        Okay? You with me?
18    A.   I'm with you.
19    Q.   Okay. Norfolk Southern
20 Railway, or none of its employees, inspected
21 this train, did they?
22    A.   At Madison?
23    Q.   Yes.
24    A.   The TRRA inspected the train.
25    Q.   So answer my question.
|Page 35 1 continue in service if the car has a plain 2 bearing that is cracked, missing," et cetera. 3 Oh, we went to the wrong 4 section. Strike all that. Sorry. It's 5 215.11, not 111. That's my fault. 6 MS. PUJARI: Thank you. 7 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 8 Q. Just to be clear, I'm at 9 215.11, sir. 10 Have you got it in front of 11 y o u ? 12 A. I do. 13 Q. All right. It says, "Each 14 railroad that operates a freight car" -- 15 Certainly that applies to NS, 16 r ig h t ? 17 And this is a railroad that is 18 putting a freight car in trains, right? 19 R ig h t ? 20 A. We're operating -- yes. 21 Q. -- "shall designate persons 22 qualified to inspect the freight cars for 23 compliance with this part and to make the 24 determinations required by this part." 25 See that?|Page 37 1 No one employed by Norfolk 2 Southern did a mechanical inspection of this 3 t r a in . 4 C o r r e c t ? 5 A. Correct. 6 MS. PUJARI: Object. 7 Objection. Vague as to which train. 8 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 9 Q. N32 that derailed in East 10 Palestine, Ohio, on February 3, 2023, left 11 Madison, Illinois, February 1, 2023. 12 Correct? 13 MS. PUJARI: Could you restate 14 the question? 15 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 16 Q. Did any Norfolk Southern 17 employee do a mechanical inspection of 18 Train 32N on February 1, 2023, in Madison, 19 I l l in o is ? 20 A. No. 21 Q. Did any Norfolk Southern 22 employee do a mechanical inspection of 23 Train 32N from Madison, Illinois, to the time 24 it derailed in East Palestine at 8:56 on 25 February 3, 2023?|
|---|---|


-----

1    A.   The train was inspected -- or
2 the cars that were added to the train at
3 Decatur, Illinois, were -- those cars were
4 inspected by a Norfolk Southern qualified
5 mechanical employee.
6    Q.   That was an air brake test,
7 wasn't it?
8    A.   It was a mechanical inspection
9 on an air brake.
10    Q.   But Car Number 23, the
11 defective wheel bearing car, GATX car, was in
12 the first part of that train, right?
13        MS. PUJARI: Objection. Vague.
14 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:
15    Q.   You've seen the consist?
16        MS. PUJARI: Objection.
17        Could you restate the question,
18    please?
19 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:
20    Q.   Let me just -- this is not
21 hard, sir.
22        The GPLX75465 that caused this
23 derailment left Madison, Illinois, on
24 February 1, 2023, in a Norfolk Southern
25 train, right?


1        THE WITNESS:  That's true.
2 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:
3    Q.   Now, I want to understand what
4 you claim the Terminal Railroad Association
5 did in Madison, Illinois, with respect to
6 this railcar.
7        Was there an inspection by that
8 r a i l r o a d ?
9    A.   The TRRA did perform a
10 mechanical inspection and brake test.
11    Q.   Have you seen a single document
12 that would verify that the Terminal Railroad
13 of St. Louis did a mechanical inspection on
14 this car?
15    A.   The only thing that I have seen
16 was both the mechanical factual report and
17 the NTSB hearing information supplied by the
18 FRA and the Norfolk -- or the National
19 Transportation Safety Board that states
20 during their hearing that the NTSB
21 investigated the car inspections for those
22 cars and that a mechanical -- a qualified
23 mechanical employee inspected those cars and
24 performed a Class I brake test at the TRRA.
25    Q.   I understand that. There's two
|Page 39 1 A. That's correct. 2 Q. That's the train that derailed, 3 and that's the car that caused the derailment 4 in East Palestine on February 3, 2023. 5 Correct? 6 A. Again, that's a -- that's what 7 we believe to have caused the derailment, 8 but, again, I do not believe the 9 investigation has been completed. 10 Q. I don't care about the 11 investigation. I care about the knowledge of 12 Norfolk Southern. 13 A. And our knowledge is, again, we 14 believe that car to be the cause; however, 15 the investigation is not complete. 16 Q. Okay. And my question is this, 17 from the time that car left Madison, 18 Illinois, on February 1st, the defective car, 19 GPLX75465, the hopper car, Number 23, from 20 the time it left Madison, Illinois, until the 21 time of the derailment, not a single Norfolk 22 Southern inspector inspected that particular 23 c a r . 24 T r u e ? 25 MS. KARIS: Object to form.|Page 41 1 different tests; there's a mechanical test 2 and an air brake test. 3 Two completely different tests, 4 right, sir? 5 A. Yes, I would consider those -- 6 the mechanical inspection and the Class I 7 test as two separate tests, yes. 8 Q. Okay. Have you seen a single 9 piece of paper generated by the Terminal 10 Railroad Association that they performed a 11 qualified mechanical inspection on this 12 defective railcar? 13 MS. KARIS: Object to form. 14 THE WITNESS: No, I've not seen 15 any documentation on each one of the 16 cars that were inspected from the 17 T R R A . 18 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 19 Q. Let me ask a different 20 q u e s t io n . 21 Do you have any documentation 22 the Terminal Railroad inspected any part of 23 Train 32N from a mechanical -- qualified 24 mechanical inspection? 25 A. I think my response is the same|
|---|---|


-----

1 as the last question. I do not have any
2 documentation from the TRRA outside of the
3 Class I brake slip.
4    Q.   Okay.
5    A.   That I've seen.
6        (Dixon 30(b)(6) Exhibit 6
7    marked for identification.)
8 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:
9    Q.   All right. Let's -- yeah. No.
10 No. Let's call up -- let's call up
11 1397047049, this e-mail. It's
12 N S - C A - 0 0 1 3 9 7 0 4 9 .
13        Have you seen this document
14 before, sir?
15    A.   What exhibit is this? Is this
16 Exhibit 6?
17    Q.   No. Down at the bottom you'll
18 see a number. It's NS-CA, and the last three
19 digits are 049.
20        Do you see that?
21    A.   I do.
22    Q.   Okay. That's the correct
23 document. It's actually a two-page -- it's
24 an e-mail string. If you go to the second
25 page, which ends in 50, that's the beginning


1 r i g h t ?
2    A.   Correct.
3    Q.   All right. And so who is
4 Randall Hunt at NS?
5    A.   He's the senior director of
6 rail line services at Norfolk Southern.
7    Q.   Okay. He's at corporate
8 headquarters in Atlanta?
9    A.   Yes, sir.
10    Q.   So we've got, it looks like,
11 that Norfolk Southern corporate headquarters
12 reached out to the general manager of the
13 Terminal Railroad after the derailment to get
14 information about this railcar.
15        Correct?
16        MS. PUJARI: Objection.
17    Misstates the document.
18        THE WITNESS: Yeah, I don't -19    I don't believe this indicates that
20    Norfolk Southern reached out -21 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:
22    Q.   Okay. Well, we at least know
23 that the general manager of the Terminal
24 Railroad Association sent an e-mail to
25 Randall Hunt, subject GPLX75465, on
|Page 43 1 of the string. 2 When you prepared for your 3 deposition here today, sir, did you see this 4 document? 5 A. No, I did not. 6 Q. Okay. Well, let's go through 7 it. I'll go through it with you. 8 We start on page 2, which is 9 the Bates number 50. 10 You can see at the bottom, Adam 11 Mahlandt, general manager, Terminal Railroad 12 Association of St. Louis. The date of the 13 e-mail is February 22, 2023. That's about 14 19 days post-derailment. And he is 15 responding to and sending an e-mail to 16 Randall Hunt at NS corporation. 17 Do you see that, sir? 18 A. Yes, sir. 19 Q. And it's reference to the 20 G P L X 7 5 4 6 5 . 21 C o r r e c t ? 22 A. That's the subject heading, 23 y e s . 24 Q. And that's the hopper car. 25 That's the number 23 car that derailed,|Page 45 1 February 22, 2023. 2 Correct? 3 A. Correct. 4 Q. Okay. Let's go to page 1. 5 MS. PUJARI: For the record, 6 I'm going to note that the information 7 below the e-mail header on this 8 document at Bates 50 is faint, very 9 difficult to read, and at least 10 illegible as to my ability to read 11 this. 12 So if we could get a better 13 copy so that we can see the entirety 14 of this document, that would be 15 appreciated. 16 MR. DENTON: Well, first of 17 all, no speaking objections. 18 Second of all, this is exactly 19 the way the NS produced it to me. I 20 can't do any better than what they 21 produced to me. Sorry about that, but 22 y'all better produce better documents. 23 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 24 Q. Let's go to page 1, 49. 25 You see Mr. Hunt, after|

Correct. 25 Q. And then he cites the two|Page 49 1 MS. PUJARI: Objection. 2 Misstates the document. 3 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 4 Q. That's what's going on here, 5 isn't it? 6 MS.

1 they're doing both inbound or an outbound
2 inspection, but the reason they're saying
3 this car was classified -- and I believe they
4 said earlier that the car was humped -5    Q.   Right.
6    A.   -- and classified, so they're
7 either doing an inbound mechanical inspection
8 when the car comes into the yard at the TRRA
9 or they're doing an outbound mechanical
10 inspection.
11    Q.   Maybe that's what they're
12 supposed to do. Do you have any evidence
13 that happened?
14    A.   I can tell you from reviewing
15 the documents -16    Q.   What document?
17    A.   -- that the hearing at the

8 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:
9    Q.   Show me a document. Show me
10 the inspection certificate.
11        MS. PUJARI: Objection.

13 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:
14    Q.   Do you have a -- do you have an

16    A.   I have not seen an inspection
17 c e r t i f i c a t e .
18    Q.   Have you seen a single
19 statement from Terminal Railroad that they
20 did the inspection?
21    A.   I have not had any
22 communications with TRRA.
23    Q.   Well, we have. Let's get the
24 subpoena out.

DENTON: 4 Q. So you indicated that Norfolk 5 Southern hasn't talked to the Terminal 6 Railroad, but I did. 7 Do you see on page 1 of 8 Exhibit 7, this is a subpoena that we sent to 9 the Terminal Railroad Association of 10 St. Louis? 11 Do you see that? 12 A. I do. 13 Can you repeat what you just 14 said, though, because I don't believe I'd 15 agree with what you just stated? 16 Q. Have you talked to anybody -- 17 A. I personally have not, but I -- 18 Q. Has anyone from the Terminal 19 Railroad -- or from Norfolk Southern talked 20 to the Terminal Railroad about this 21 mechanical inspection? 22 A. And my response was, I am not 23 aware of any discussions -- 24 Q. Okay. 25 A. -- but I don't know.|

1    Q.   Okay. But you're testifying on
2 behalf of the railroad, right? So the
3 railroad doesn't know, right?
4        MS. PUJARI: Objection.
5    Misstates the testimony.
6 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:
7    Q.   Norfolk Southern railroad does
8 not know whether or not they've communicated
9 with the Terminal Railroad about a mechanical

11        Is that your testimony?
12    A.   My test -13        MS. PUJARI: Objection. Beyond

17    objections before we get the judge on
18    the phone?
19        MS. PUJARI: They're not
20    speaking objections.
21        MR. DENTON: Yes, they are.
22        Why don't we -- Carrie, would

6    Q.   Follow me now?
7    A.   I do.
8    Q.   Paragraph 4. We asked them to
9 provide any information on a mechanical or
10 air brake test on this railcar, GPLX75465.
11        And what's their answer? "None
12 located other than the air brake inspection
13 and test certificate dated 2/1/23."
14        R i g h t ?
15    A.   That's what it states here,
16 y e s .
17    Q.   Okay. So the Terminal Railroad
18 Association has no evidence, paper evidence
19 or otherwise, that a mechanical inspection
20 took place on this railcar on February 1st in
21 Madison, Illinois, correct?
22        MS. PUJARI: Objection.
23    Misstates the document.
24 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:
25    Q.   That's what it says, right?
|Page 55 1 question.) 2 THE WITNESS: My testimony is 3 I'm not aware of any communications 4 outside of what I was just provided in 5 Exhibit B, any communications with 6 TRRA, other than the brake slip that 7 was provided to us. 8 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 9 Q. Okay. And so let's look at the 10 subpoena. Let's go to page 4 of 5. 11 Let's go right up to the top, 12 paragraph 4. "We subpoenaed the Terminal and 13 asked for them to provide copies of all 14 documents that showed any other mechanical 15 and/or air brake inspection of GPLX74565 on 16 or about February 1, 2023." 17 Do you see that? Do you see 18 where I'm reading from? 19 A. I do. 20 And this document is a request. 21 Can you explain what it is? 22 Q. It's a subpoena. 23 A. Okay. 24 Q. I subpoenaed, on behalf of the 25 residents of East Palestine, information from|Page 57 1 MS.

Yeah. 7 A. -- "other than the air brake 8 test and test certificate." 9 Q. Right. 10 So there's no evidence from 11 Terminal Railroad Association that they did a 12 mechanical inspection on this GPLX75465 13 railcar, correct? 14 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Form. 15 THE WITNESS: Yeah, I would 16 state that they did not supply any 17 documents, or they're stating they 18 don't have any other documents. 19 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 20 Q. Okay. 21 A. But I don't believe they're 22 saying that they did not perform a mechanical 23 inspection. 24 Q. Well, you have to have a 25 document if you did it, wouldn't you, sir?|

1    A.   I'm not quite sure how the TRRA
2 captures their mechanical inspections on
3 railcars. They -4    Q.   They didn't do it, did they?
5 They didn't do it.
6        MS. PUJARI: Objection.
7    Leading. Argumentative.
8 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:
9    Q.   Let me ask you this.
10        Does Norfolk Southern Railway
11 Company have any evidence that Terminal
12 Railroad did a mechanical inspection on this
13 car?
14    A.   Again, I'll go back to what I
15 told you that was -- that I read from the
16 transcript from the NTSB hearings.
17    Q.   I don't care what the NTSB
18 said. I want to know what Norfolk Southern
19 knows.
20        MS. PUJARI: Objection. Asked
21    and answered.
22 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:
23    Q.   Norfolk Southern has done no
24 investigation, filed a lawsuit against GATX
25 saying there was a mechanical inspection done


1 that a mechanical inspection was not
2 performed by a qualified mechanical employee
3 at the TRRA.
4    Q.   Well, wouldn't you, as Norfolk
5 Southern's representative, want to know the
6 answer to that before you sued GATX and made
7 that allegation?
8        MS. PUJARI: Objection. Calls
9    for a legal conclusion.
10        THE WITNESS: Yeah, I can't
11    speak on behalf of -12 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:
13    Q.   Of whom? You're speaking on
14 behalf of Norfolk Southern. That's your role
15 h e r e .
16    A.   I can't speak on behalf of
17 counsel, legal counsel, with respect to any
18 l a w s u i t .
19    Q.   Well, you were asked to testify
20 about the lawsuit. That's what these notices
21 are, the paragraphs in the lawsuit.

23    A.   And I'm prepared to talk to
24 those -25    Q.   Okay. Well, the very first
|Page 59 1 on this car, and you have no evidence that 2 took place; is that the Norfolk Southern way? 3 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Asked 4 and answered. Argumentative. 5 You can answer. 6 THE WITNESS: As I stated 7 before, I have not seen a mechanical 8 inspection or a document that states, 9 here's the mechanical inspection on a 10 particular railcar from the TRRA. 11 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 12 Q. Or that train at all. There 13 was no mechanical inspection done on that 14 train. There's no document to suggest that 15 that happened, right? 16 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Vague. 17 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 18 Q. From the TRRA. 19 A. On the first part of your 20 question, I would say there -- that I -- we 21 don't -- we don't have a document that 22 states, that shows, that that mechanical 23 inspection occurred -- 24 Q. Okay. 25 A. -- but I'm not going to claim|Page 61 1 topic is the allegation of a mechanical 2 inspection on this railcar that you have no 3 evidence for, "you" being Norfolk Southern, 4 r ig h t ? 5 MS.

PUJARI: I'm entitled to 18 state the grounds. 19 MR. DENTON: You're not 20 entitled to coach the witness. 21 MS. PUJARI: I'm not coaching. 22 MR. DENTON: Carrie, please, 23 one more time. 24 (Court Reporter read back 25 question.)|

1        THE WITNESS: I would respond
2    that I don't -- as I stated earlier, I
3    don't have any documents that I've
4    seen that indicate -- from the TRRA, a
5    document from them showing a
6    mechanical inspection.
7        Do I believe a mechanical
8    inspection was performed at the -- by
9    the TRRA? The answer is, yes, either
10    on the inbound or outbound.
11 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:
12    Q.   Well, what's an inbound
13 inspection? Is that a roll-by inspection?
14    A.   No.
15    Q.   What's an inbound -16    A.   Since the cars -- the cars that
17 you had indicated earlier through other
18 exhibits, I guess Exhibit 6, where you say,
19 note the screenshot below confirming the car
20 was humped -21    Q.   Right.
22    A.   -- classified.
23        So at the TRRA, when the car
24 came into the yard or before the car departed
25 the yard, the car would have had a mechanical

2    Q.   Let's get -- I don't have a

6 Exhibit 8.
7        This is one of the documents
8 you reviewed, correct?
9    A.   This is not the document that I
10 was referencing.
11    Q.   Well, it's one of the documents
12 that was in the documents that you reviewed.
13        Did you look at this one at
14 all?
15        MS. PUJARI: Could you point us
16    to where this is listed?
17        MR. DENTON: Yeah, it's in the
18    Bates range in the letter from Al.
19        MS. PUJARI: Exhibit -- on
20    Exhibit 1, Counsel?
21        MR. DENTON: It's in the

24    start with 162 were in this range.
25        Here, we'll just mark this as
|Page 63 1 inspection. 2 Q. I know it's required. I know 3 it's supposed to. 4 You have no evidence it took 5 place, do you? 6 A. Again, I can't put my hands on 7 a document, but I have read numerous -- well, 8 I read, again, from the NTSB hearings that 9 the NTSB and the chief investigator confirmed 10 that the cars were mechanically inspected and 11 a Class I brake test -- 12 Q. Show me that document. I don't 13 believe it. 14 MS. PUJARI: Objection. 15 Argumentative. 16 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 17 Q. Show me the document. 18 A. Okay. We can -- 19 Q. Let's get -- let's get -- 20 A.

You're saying it wasn't in 8 the documents you reviewed. We're 9 going to that question first. 10 MS. PUJARI: And which exhibit 11 is this, Counsel? 12 MR. DENTON: This is -- this is 13 a -- do they have a copy? 14 MS. PUJARI: I don't. 15 MR. DENTON: Okay. 16 MS. PUJARI: Okay. Thank you. 17 (Dixon 30(b)(6) Exhibit 9 18 marked for identification.) 19 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 20 Q. All right. So I'm sure you 21 haven't seen this letter. It's a letter 22 between lawyers. It's when Norfolk Southern 23 lawyers sends documents to plaintiffs. 24 And down there at the bottom of 25 the paragraph it says, "This production|

6        Do you see that?
7        And it goes from
8 NS-CA-001617983 to 001625358.
9        Do you see that?
10    A.   I see where it states that,
11 yes.
12    Q.   Okay. And 1623465, which is
13 Exhibit 8, the document I -- Exhibit 9 that I
14 handed you, is in that range.
15        Correct?

14        Do you see that?
15    A.   I'm on page 5.
16    Q.   It says, "Timeline of NS
17 railcar GPLX on NS Train 32N, February 1" -18 February 1, 1 -- "February 1, 2023, Madison

20        Do you see that?
21    A.   Yes.
22    Q.   Follow me?
23    A.   Yes.
24    Q.   It says, "Class I air brake
25 test certified by the Terminal Railroad."
|Page 67 1 MR. MURRY: Right. 2 But we've switched them because 3 he's talking about the letter first. 4 So we went and Roger laid foundation 5 with this and -- 6 MR. DENTON: That's all right. 7 Just leave it as 9. That's fine. 8 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 9 Q. Exhibit 9, the letter. 10 All I'm trying to point out, 11 it's real simple. 12 The document I'm showing you 13 from NTSB is in the range of documents that 14 they told -- the lawyers told me you 15 reviewed. 16 MS. PUJARI: Objection. 17 Misstates the letter. 18 THE WITNESS: I don't -- I 19 don't take any issue with what you 20 stated -- 21 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 22 Q. Okay. All right. 23 A. -- but I've not reviewed this 24 document. 25 Q. Okay. Well, they told me it|Page 69 1 Right? Right? 2 A. Right. 3 Q. And we've got a brake slip test 4 from Terminal that said they did that, right? 5 A. Correct. 6 Q. Okay.

Then it says, 17 "Train crew conducted the predeparture 18 mechanical inspection of Train 32N." 19 That's not what you testified 20 to, is it? 21 A. No. I testified to what I had 22 read on the -- from the NTSB hearing. 23 Q. Well, this is an NTSB report, 24 right? It was part of the hearing? 25 A. I assume it is part of the SCD|

2    Q.   Okay. So who told NTSB that
3 the NS train crew did the mechanical
4 inspection in Madison, Illinois?
5        MS. PUJARI: Objection. Lack
6    of foundation.
7        THE WITNESS: I'm not aware of
8    who would have informed NTSB.
9 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:
10    Q.   Because it didn't happen, did
11 it? The train crew didn't inspect this
12 train, correct?
13        MS. PUJARI: Objection. Lack
14    of foundation.
15        THE WITNESS: I don't know.
16 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:
17    Q.   You don't know? Norfolk
18 Southern Railway Company doesn't know if its
19 own train crew inspected this train in
20 Madison, Illinois?
21        MS. PUJARI: Objection.
22    Misstates the document. Lack of
23    foundation. Asked and answered.
24        THE WITNESS: Again, as I
25    stated, what I'd -- what I had read in


1 right there in front of you.
2        R i g h t ?
3    A.   That's correct.
4    Q.   So do you think the conductor
5 walked two miles down one set of track
6 looking at 600 wheel bearings and came back
7 the other two miles? Do you think that
8 h a p p e n e d ?
9        MS. PUJARI: Objection. Calls
10    for speculation. Lack of foundation.
11        THE WITNESS: I don't know if
12    the train crew inspected it, but,
13    again, I'm going from what I
14    understood from the NTSB hearing, that
15    these cars were mechanically
16    i n s p e c t e d .
17 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:
18    Q.   This is the NTSB document.
19 Train crew conducted the inspection.
20    A.   This is one NTSB document.
21    Q.   Right. Okay.
22        The truth of the matter is,
23 Norfolk Southern Railway has no
24 understanding, no paperwork of its own, that
25 any inspection was done on this train before
|Page 71 1 the NTSB hearings, that a qualified 2 mechanical inspection was -- was 3 completed at the TRRA on those 4 r a i lc a r s . 5 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 6 Q. The NTSB said the train crew 7 did. I'm looking at the document. 8 MS. PUJARI: Objection. 9 Misstates prior testimony. 10 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 11 Q. The train crew isn't a 12 qualified mechanical inspection, is it? 13 A. Train crews are capable of 14 mechanically inspecting a -- 15 Q. So did you talk to that 16 conductor? Did he walk that entire 200 -- or 17 two-mile-long train and inspect every wheel 18 b e a r in g ? 19 A. I'm not aware of -- myself, I'm 20 not aware of those conversations with the 21 c o n d u c t o r . 22 Q. So the train was two miles long 23 when it left Madison.

Lack 4 of -- argumentative and misstates 5 prior testimony. 6 THE WITNESS: Again, as I 7 stated prior, I don't have, or have 8 not seen, a particular document on 9 each car's inspection. 10 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 11 Q. All right. Let's move on then. 12 After the train leaves Madison, 13 Illinois, it's being operated by a Norfolk 14 Southern crew, an engineer and a conductor. 15 C o r r e c t ? 16 A. Correct. 17 Q. And it heads up north in 18 Illinois to Decatur, Illinois. 19 C o r r e c t ? 20 A. Correct. 21 Q. And I don't know if you know 22 the geography. I was from Illinois 23 originally. Decatur is about 120 miles from 24 M a d is o n . 25 Is that about right?|

1    A.   I've been on our Illinois
2 division, but I'm not familiar with the
3 distance between the two.
4    Q.   All right. But in Madison -5 or in Decatur, Illinois, when the train gets
6 there, it goes into the yard.
7        C o r r e c t ?
8    A.   Correct.
9    Q.   A number of cars are taken off
10 that were on the train from Madison,
11 Illinois, and some other cars are put on.
12        C o r r e c t ?
13    A.   Correct.
14    Q.   And I think one of the engines
15 that was on the front -- there were three on
16 the front -- it was moved -- one of the
17 engines was moved towards the middle, or
18 line 110 or 112 of the train.
19        R i g h t ?
20    A.   Correct.
21    Q.   We call that a distributed
22 power, DP, unit in the railroad lingo?
23    A.   Correct.
24    Q.   Okay. So let's go back to -25 all right. Let's go from there.


1 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:
2    Q.   Mr. Dixon, I want to go back to

4 Safety and Human Performance Group Chair's
5 Factual Report, and I want you to look at
6 page 10 of 20, please, sir.
7        And on that page, I'm going to
8 look at 2.2, Post-Derailment Inspection of
9 the NS Train 32N's Cars.
10        Do you see that?
11    A.   Yes.
12    Q.   It says, "Post-derailment
13 inspection was conducted by the mechanical

Do we have a 6 Bates number for that? 7 It's NS-CA-1622398. We've got 8 an image of it. 9 And I don't know. What number 10 is this, Carrie? 10. 11 No, that's not the right one, 12 guys. It's the one that was on the 13 screen, is the right one, but that's 14 not the right one. 15 Can we take a short break 16 anyway? 17 MS. PUJARI: Sure. Take a 18 break. 19 THE WITNESS: Okay. 20 VIDEOGRAPHER: 10:32, we are 21 off the video record. 22 (Off the record at 10:32 a.m.) 23 VIDEOGRAPHER: 10:48, we are on 24 the video record. 25|Page 77 1 C o r r e c t ? 2 A. They did not derail, correct. 3 Q. But when we talk about 4 inspections, mechanical inspections, FRA went 5 out and looked at those 22 cars, and six of 6 22 had FRA defects. 7 R ig h t ? 8 A. According to this document, 9 c o r r e c t . 10 Q. Okay. Cars 23 through 60 11 derailed, so they couldn't look at those. 12 R ig h t ? 13 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Lack 14 of foundation. 15 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 16 Q. Well, let me just ask this. 17 Cars 23 through 60 derailed. 18 R ig h t ? 19 A. Correct. 20 Q. Okay. Car 61 to 72 did not 21 derail but were damaged. 22 R ig h t ? 23 A. Correct. 24 Q. And then let's go look at 25 Cars 73 to 149. That's towards the end of|

16    A.   Vaguely familiar with the cross
17 k e y .
18    Q.   What is it?
19        MS. PUJARI: Objection. Beyond
20    the scope of the 30(b)(6) topics.
21        THE WITNESS: Yeah, I'd have to
22    reference some material. I can't
23    remember -24        MR. DENTON: Okay.

Beyond the scope of 16 the 30(b)(6) notice. 17 THE WITNESS: I'm not sure what 18 all of these FRA defects were, so I 19 can't -- 20 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 21 Q. Well, let's look at the ones 22 that they outline. 23 Brake pipe leaking. That's 24 supposed to be found in the air brake test. 25 R ig h t ?|Page 81 1 my head. 2 MR. DENTON: So if that's not a 3 speaking objection -- you got the 4 answer you wanted -- I've not seen 5 one. No more speaking objections. 6 MS. PUJARI: Sir, stating the 7 grounds of an objection is not a 8 speaking objection. 9 MR. DENTON: You're stating it 10 by giving him the answer. He had an 11 answer until you told him it was 12 beyond the scope. That's what's going 13 on here, and it's not allowed under 14 the local rules. 15 MS. PUJARI: I am familiar with 16 the local rules, and all I'm doing is 17 stating my grounds. 18 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 19 Q. All right. Back to you, sir. 20 All of those things we just 21 underlined in red are things that are 22 supposed to be evaluated and examined in a 23 mechanical inspection. 24 T r u e ? 25 A. All the things --|

1        MS. PUJARI: Mr. Dixon, the red
2    underlining is on the screen.
3 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:
4    Q.   Yes.
5    A.   I believe that's correct.
6        (Dixon 30(b)(6) Exhibit 10
7    marked for identification.)
8 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:
9    Q.   All right. So let's move on,
10 and I want to show the jurors and you,
11 Mr. Dixon, a map that was prepared by the
12 NTSB. What exhibit number are we on, please
13 and thank you? 10?
14        So this is marked Exhibit 10.
15 It's also got an NS Bates number of
17        And this was one of -- it was
18 just a demonstrative map of where -- of where
19 this train traveled before the derailment.
20        Right, sir?
21    A.   Correct.
22    Q.   Started in Madison, Illinois,
23 went to Decatur, a couple small towns in
24 Illinois and Indiana, but went to Peru,
25 Indiana, which is just north of Indianapolis.


1 at. It's that native video.
2        And so the native production is
3 NS-CA-001618174, which is the cover sheet,
4 and this is a screenshot of the beginning of
5 that video. We'll mark that, and I think -6 right. All right.
7        But the actual exhibit is going
8 to be the video that we play, Carrie. But
9 this is the production sheet that came with
10 it from NS, and this is the first screenshot
11 of that video.
12        (Dixon 30(b)(6) Exhibit 11
13    marked for identification.)
14 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:
15    Q.   So are you ready, sir? You're
16 going to have to watch the monitor. We're
17 going to play a video for you.
18    A.   Okay.
19    Q.   Are you ready to go?
20    A.   I'm ready.
21        MR. DENTON: Michael, please.
22        (Video played.)
23 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:
24    Q.   Do you see that circle there,
25 sir, on the video?
|Page 83 1 R ig h t ? 2 A. Correct. 3 Q. Over to Toledo. 4 R ig h t ? 5 A. Correct. 6 Q. Then into Cleveland. There's a 7 big NS yard there in Cleveland. 8 R ig h t ? 9 A. I wouldn't necessarily call it 10 big, but there's an NS yard in Cleveland. 11 Q. Well, how would you describe 12 the size of that yard? 13 A. It's a regular-sized rail 14 yard -- 15 Q. Okay. 16 A. -- in the Norfolk Southern 17 s y s t e m . 18 Q. Okay. And then the train 19 travels kind of southeast from Cleveland down 20 through east -- to East Palestine where it 21 d e r a i ls . 22 R ig h t ? 23 A. Correct. 24 Q. Okay. So there's another 25 document that was in that group you looked|Page 85 1 A. I do. 2 Q. Fire underneath the front axle 3 of that car. 4 Do you see that? 5 A. I see the fire. I'm not quite 6 sure exactly where it is -- 7 Q. Okay. 8 A. -- axle-wise. 9 Q. Okay. But it's certainly down 10 towards the bottom of the car? 11 A. Correct. 12 Q. Okay. Please continue, 13 M ic h a e l. 14 (Video played.) 15 Q. See that, sir, that -- all that 16 fire under that car? 17 A. Yes. 18 Q. It's a hopper car, isn't it, 19 s ir ? 20 A. It is. 21 Q. All right. Okay. Michael, 22 p le a s e . 23 (Video played.) 24 Q. Stop right there, Michael. 25 See that red fire underneath|

1 the bottom of that car?
2    A.   I do.
3    Q.   All right.
4        (Video played.)
5    Q.   Stop that, please.
6        You see the fire under the lead
7 axle of that hopper car?
8    A.   I do see what appears to be a
9 f l a m e .
10    Q.   Okay. Keep going, Michael,
11 p l e a s e .
12        (Video played.)
13    Q.   See the fire and the sparks
14 flying out of that car? Or flying off the
15 bottom of that car?
16    A.   I do.
17    Q.   Okay. There's some more.
18        (Video played.)
19    Q.   Look at that.
20        Do you see that, sir? All that
21 fire under that car? And sparks?
22        Do you see it?
23    A.   I do.
24        (Video played.)
25    Q.   See the car going by on fire?


1 Michael? Thank you.
2        After seeing that, sir -- have
3 you ever seen video before?
4    A.   I have not seen that video.
5    Q.   It was part of the NTSB
6 investigation.
7        You saw that on the tape,
8 right?
9    A.   Yes.
10    Q.   Is there any doubt in your mind
11 that the wheel bearing on that hopper car was
12 overheating and that's what caused the
13 d e r a i l m e n t ?
14        MS. PUJARI: Objection. Calls
15    for expert testimony.
16        THE WITNESS:  I'm not quite
17    sure if, again, from the video that I
18    saw the exact -- it was a hopper car
19    that I observed. You know, it appears
20    the fire is under the car. That's
21    what I can glean from the video.
22        (Dixon 30(b)(6) Exhibit 12
23    marked for identification.)
24 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:
25    Q.   Okay. Let's go to the next
|Page 87 1 MS. PUJARI: Objection to the 2 characterization. 3 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 4 Q. Go back, Michael, just a little 5 b it . 6 S t o p . 7 Do you see all the fire under 8 that hopper car, sir? 9 A. I do see fire under the hopper 10 c a r . 11 Q. Okay. This is just seconds 12 before the derailment. 13 Please play the video longer, 14 please, Michael. 15 (Video played.) 16 Q. In the far left, you'll see the 17 fire start. 18 See that bright flash of fire 19 right before the -- that's the derailment, 20 s ir . 21 Do you see that? 22 A. I do see the light -- 23 Q. All right. 24 A. -- increase. 25 Q. Is that the end of the tape,|Page 89 1 document, please, which is the bearing 2 p h o t o s . 3 Michael, it's NS-CA-1622039. 4 This will be Exhibit Number 12. Thank you, 5 Carrie. 6 This is another NTSB document. 7 It's -- it has some images of the bearing, 8 the wheel bearing. 9 Do you see that, sir? 10 A. I do. 11 Q. Let's go to page 2, and I want 12 to talk to you about certain sections. 13 Let's -- maybe Michael can help 14 me here. 15 The photo in the upper left, 16 can we grab that and make it a little larger 17 on the screen so we can see it better, 18 p le a s e ? 19 MS. PUJARI: Counsel, for the 20 record, can you identify the report to 21 which this Exhibit 1, NTSB Exhibit 1, 22 is connected? It says Group B, 23 Exhibit 1. 24 Do you have the report, sir? 25 MR. DENTON: I'm sure we do,|

1    and so do you. I just want to ask him
2    about this document.
3        Is there some problem with this
4    not being a document?
5        MS. PUJARI: I'm just trying to
6    keep the record clean and identify
7    which -8        MR. DENTON: We'll have to
9    get -- we'll get it to you. We'll get
10    it to you, but I want to ask questions
11    about the document. We'll clean that
12    up at the end.
13 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:
14    Q.   Let's go back to this document,
15 sir, Exhibit -- what did we say it was? -16 12.
17        Page 2, it's the wheel set.
18 You talked earlier that a wheel set, there's
19 an axle and there's two wheels. That
20 basically is the two wheels and the axle.
21        R i g h t ?
22    A.   Correct.
23    Q.   And this is actually the wheel
24 set. As you can see, that L1 bearing and
25 journal is separated on the right.


1    A.   Correct.
2    Q.   Okay. And let's go to the
3 image in the middle, which is L1 bearing.
4        L1 means left 1 bearing, right?
5    A.   Correct.
6    Q.   Okay. That's the wheel bearing
7 that the investigators found after the
8 derailment.
9        Right?
10    A.   And is this a particular wheel
11 bearing -12    Q.   Yeah, the one that derailed the
13 train.
14    A.   So is the question, is this the
15 L1 bearing on the GPLX74 -- 75465?
16    Q.   I know it is.
17        But my question is, do you see
18 the defective wheel bearing in that
19 photograph?
20        MS. PUJARI: Objection.
21    Misstates the document.
22        I think where Mr. Dixon is
23    having trouble is this doesn't have a
24    connection to the railcar, sir.
25 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:
|Page 91 1 Do you see that label there 2 that's showing that it's missing? 3 A. Yes. 4 Q. That's where the wheel bearing 5 is supposed to be, right, sir? 6 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Vague. 7 THE WITNESS: From the picture 8 I'm looking at with the L1 bearing and 9 journal separated, correct, that would 10 be the location of the -- 11 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 12 Q. Okay. And maybe this will help 13 orientate us and help the jurors. 14 Let's go down to the image 15 right below it, which is the opposite view of 16 wheel set 1. 17 That's the opposite side where 18 the right, or R1, bearing and journal was 19 still intact. 20 Do you see that? 21 A. I do. 22 Q. And where it says, "R1 bearing 23 and journal intact," that's what burned off 24 and was missing on the left side. 25 Right, sir?|Page 93 1 Q. There wasn't any other wheel 2 bearing the FRA looked at, was there, other 3 than the one that was on this hopper car? 4 A. I couldn't answer that. 5 Q. All right. Let's just talk 6 about this. The L1 wheel bearing that you 7 see on the screen, that's a mangled mess, 8 isn't it? 9 MS. PUJARI: Objection. The 10 photo speaks for itself. 11 MR. DENTON: It sure does. A 12 mangled mess. 13 MS. PUJARI: Same objection. 14 THE WITNESS: I would describe 15 it as a mangled bearing, that's for 16 s u r e . 17 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 18 Q. A mangled bearing. Okay. 19 And you see that other image to 20 the right of it, L -- the L1 journal? 21 A. I do. 22 Q. Okay. And what's a journal, 23 wheel journal, sir? 24 A. It's what houses the bearings. 25 Q. Okay. And you see the far left|
|---|---|

1 tip of that? Looks like it's certainly
2 broken off, but it looks like it melted off.
3        Do you see that?
4    A.   I do see the broken piece.
5    Q.   All right. Let's go to the
6 next page.
7        And the graphic on the right is
8 an exemplar. This is what a wheel bearing is
9 supposed to look like on the right when it's
10 manufactured, correct?
11        The different -- describes the
12 different pieces of it, right?
13    A.   Correct.
14    Q.   And then you see in the middle,
15 the left one, bearing off the hopper car,
16 again, is shown there.
17        And you would call that a
18 mangled wheel bearing?
19    A.   Correct.
20    Q.   All right. And then let's go
21 to the last page of this exhibit.
22        And these are some exemplar
23 photographs that the NTSB provided, and it
24 talks about what the inspectors are supposed
25 to look at.


1 truck, right? Or an axle truck?
2    A.   Yeah, connecting the two axles.
3    Q.   Right. Okay.
4        And then it -- and then the
5 close-up down there in external inspector
6 view, that one down there, that's a close-up
7 of the cap on top -- on what holds the
8 bearing on.
9        R i g h t ?
10    A.   Bottom right -11        MS. PUJARI: Objection.
12        What's -- bottom right or top?
13        MR. DENTON: I'm sorry, the one
14    that's on the screen. The
15    inspector -16        THE WITNESS: External view?
17 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:
18    Q.   Yeah.
19    A.   Correct.
20    Q.   Those three bolts, that's
21 what's holding -22    A.   Those are the three cap
23 screws -24    Q.   Right.
25    A.   -- and the cap.
|Page 95 1 Let's do the left side of that 2 document, Michael, if we could. There we go. 3 P e r f e c t . 4 Do you see that it says in the 5 bottom right picture, "inspector external 6 view," with the blue arrow pointing? 7 A. I do see that. 8 Q. All right. And that's pointing 9 to the outside of the cap of the wheel 10 bearing, right? 11 A. Correct. 12 Q. And there's actually -- and 13 that's -- that -- and when we talk about a 14 railroad car, there's actually two wheel 15 bearings and two axles on the -- on either -- 16 on the front of the car -- there's one axle 17 on the front of the car that has two wheels 18 and four-wheel bearings, and there's a set on 19 the back. 20 R ig h t ? 21 A. Typically two axles on a truck. 22 Q. Right. 23 And that picture in the top 24 there, that would be what in the railroad 25 industry we call a truck. It's a wheel|Page 97 1 Q. That hold the bearing on, 2 r ig h t . 3 And then you see under that it 4 says, "Inspector under-car view." 5 That's what the inspector is 6 supposed to look at when they inspect, these 7 qualified mechanical inspections. 8 R ig h t ? 9 A. Correct. 10 Q. And then let's look at the 11 right side of that exhibit. 12 And again, these are exemplar 13 pictures the NTSB provided at the hearing, 14 but it shows examples of what the inspector 15 is supposed to look for. 16 Do you see that top picture of 17 a wheel bearing that says they look for 18 "clearly formed droplets"? 19 Do you see that? 20 A. I do. 21 Q. The red arrow pointing to it? 22 And then the two other arrows 23 on the wheel bearing on the right side of 24 that picture, do you see that? 25 A. I do.|
|---|---|

1    Q.   And then the inspector is
2 supposed to look for the "inboard seal," if
3 it's out of position. That's the middle
4 picture with the red arrow.
5        Do you see that?
6    A.   I do see the picture of the
7 inbound {sic} seal.
8    Q.   Okay.
9    A.   Inboard seal.
10    Q.   And then down at the bottom,
11 there's some exemplar pictures of a bearing
12 leak, indicating slung grease on the truck
13 from the wheel bearing.
14        Do you see those various
15 a r r o w s ?
16    A.   I do see those arrows.
17    Q.   And that's what a mechanical
18 inspector is supposed to look at during this
19 required inspection on each and every wheel
20 set on the train, right?
21        MS. PUJARI: Objection. Lack
22    of foundation.
23        THE WITNESS: Those are some of
24    the things rail inspectors are trying
25    to identify when inspecting a train.


1    A.   I'm sorry.
2    Q.   Okay. And so I just want to
3 kind of -4        MS. PUJARI: Sorry, Counsel.
5    In terms of the notice, I don't
6    believe it is -- oh, 54 to 141.
7        Okay. Thank you. Sorry about
8    that.
9 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:
10    Q.   Okay. So I want to ask you
11 about the derailment response. And I'm just
12 going to do kind of a high level right now to
13 just kind of put timelines in context.
14        We can agree the derailment
15 occurred on February 3, 2023, at about
16 8:56 p.m.
17        C o r r e c t ?
18    A.   Correct.
19    Q.   And there was an immediate
20 f i r e .
21        C o r r e c t ?
22    A.   I believe there was.
23    Q.   Okay. And then there's a lot
24 of emergency response from a lot of people
25 trying to battle the fire, but I want to kind
|Page 99 1 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 2 Q. Okay. All right. So I'm going 3 to switch gears. All those documents you can 4 probably set aside for now. I'm going to 5 change topics, if you don't mind, and I'll 6 set the stage here. 7 I want to talk about the 8 derailment response. That was, I think, 9 paragraphs 72 to 100 in the third-party 10 complaint. 11 Let's go to paragraph 72, 12 page 16, Michael. There it is. 13 You see where F, it says, 14 "Derailment response"? Do you see that? 15 A. I do. 16 Q. And that whole page is all 17 painted yellow, highlighted yellow, because 18 those are all things that you were asked to 19 be prepared to testify about. 20 Correct? 21 A. I have reviewed this, yes. 22 Q. You have reviewed this? Is 23 that what you said, sir? 24 A. Yes. 25 Q. Okay.|Page 101 1 of move forward to the next date in this 2 document, which is paragraph 76. 3 There's a mention in here by 4 Norfolk Southern that on February 4th, early, 5 sometime after midnight, so that must be just 6 a few hours after the derailment, the vinyl 7 chloride tank cars began activating and 8 releasing pressure in a cycle of 30 seconds 9 on, releasing, and two minutes off. 10 Is that your understanding? 11 A. That is my understanding. 12 Q. Okay. And the vinyl chloride, 13 you understand, was hazardous material, 14 right, that was in those tank cars? 15 A. Correct. 16 Q. And there were a total of five 17 of them that were involved in the derailment 18 and the surrounding pool of fires. 19 C o r r e c t ? 20 A. Correct. 21 Q. And frankly, those -- but those 22 weren't the only railcars that burned. There 23 were other tank cars that had material in 24 them that burned. 25 R ig h t ?|
|---|---|


-----

1        In addition to the vinyl
2 chloride cars.
3        R i g h t ?
4    A.   Correct.
5    Q.   There were hopper cars with
6 plastic pellets that were burning.
7        R i g h t ?
8    A.   Correct.
9    Q.   There were boxcars, I think.
10 One of them even had a bunch of beer in it.
11 Somebody didn't get their beer. It burned
12 u p .
13        R i g h t ?
14    A.   I believe there were some
15 boxcars that were -- that sustained fire
16 d a m a g e .
17    Q.   Okay. And one of the documents
18 you mentioned that you looked at with respect
19 to the derailment response was the hazardous
20 materials report from the NTSB.
21        Am I right about that?
22    A.   Correct.
23        (Dixon 30(b)(6) Exhibit 13
24    marked for identification.)
25


1        Okay. And I just want to go
2 down, about two-thirds down. It shows that
3 Robert Wood, Norfolk Southern Railway,
4 Atlanta, Georgia, was a group member.
5        Do you see that?
6    A.   I do.
7    Q.   And I think that was one person
8 you said you may have talked to in
9 preparation for the deposition.
10        You told me that earlier,
11 didn't you?
12    A.   That was. What I had stated
13 is, I had a question concerning -- that I
14 posed to Robert Wood concerning the emergency
15 response guide and confirming that 2020 -16 2020 was the last version.
17    Q.   Okay. So the point of it is,
18 Robert Wood is knowledgeable about HAZMAT at
19 the NS, right? He's one of the managers?
20    A.   I believe he does have
21 knowledge of HAZMAT.
22    Q.   Okay. And he was on -- and he
23 was part of the group that wrote this report.
24        R i g h t ?
25    A.   I don't know if he wrote
|Page 103 1 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 2 Q. Okay. I'm going to try to get 3 that document out. We'll mark it. It's a 4 big, thick one, unfortunately. 5 And, Michael, for the -- it's 6 NS-CA-001624324, but it's marked as Exhibit 7 Number 13. 8 Okay. And this is the 9 Hazardous Materials Group Chair's Factual 10 R e p o r t . 11 You said you reviewed that one, 12 r ig h t ? 13 A. I didn't read every single 14 word, but I have reviewed most of the -- most 15 of the document here. 16 Q. Okay. Well, let's -- I'm not 17 going to read it all, it's 150 pages, but I'm 18 going to ask you about parts of it, if you'll 19 work with me. 20 If we go to page 5 of 158. 21 Are you able to get that, sir? 22 A. I am. 23 Q. I think you'll do better if you 24 take the paperclip off. That's what I just 25 found out. But it's up to you.|Page 105 1 anything. I'm thinking he was part -- 2 Q. But he was a group member for 3 this report. 4 R ig h t ? 5 A. He was a group member, yes. 6 Q. All right. Let's just go right 7 over to page 6 of 158. I think it's just one 8 o v e r . 9 And I'm not going to go through 10 everything, but train information down at the 11 bottom of the page, it says, "11 of the 12 derailed tank cars contained hazardous 13 materials, including five tank cars with 14 stabilized vinyl chloride monomer, one tank 15 car each of isobutylene butyl acrylate, 16 2-ethylhexyl acrylate, ethylene glycol 17 monobutyl ether, and two tank cars of benzene 18 r e s id u e . " 19 Is that your understanding, 20 that all of those hazardous materials cars 21 d e r a i le d ? 22 A. Yes. 23 Q. All right. Let's go to page 8 24 of 158. 25 I don't know if you can blow|

1 that up a little bit, the map, Michael.
2        This is an aerial photograph
3 that shows some of the derailment.
4        Do you see that?
5    A.   I do.
6    Q.   And the -- I think the red
7 numbers, if I read this correctly, are at
8 least four of the Oxy Vinyl -- not Oxy
9 Vinyl -- vinyl chloride cars.
10        Do you see that? 28, 29, 30,
11 31, bottom paragraph?
12    A.   Yes.
13    Q.   And then at the top, I think
14 Car Number 50 -- what is that? I can't read
15 it. It's too small for my eyes. But it's
16 the other vinyl chloride car, the one down.
17 It's 55.
18        Right? Do you see that?
19    A.   I have Car 53.
20    Q.   Okay. Well, sometimes these
21 numbers get off. But the bottom line is,
22 this is an aerial photograph that shows the
23 d e r a i l m e n t .
24        Right? Part of the derailment?
25    A.   Correct.


1        But the bottom line is,
2 887,400 -- or 887,000 pounds of vinyl
3 chloride in those five cars.
4        R i g h t ?
5    A.   Correct.
6    Q.   115,000 gallons in the vinyl
7 chloride cars, just those five cars.
8        R i g h t ?
9    A.   I'm not going to do the math on
10 it. It's 887,000 pounds.
11    Q.   Well, they did the -- the NTSB
12 did the math for us.
13    A.   Okay. The 15. The 15, I see
14 it.
15    Q.   Okay. I wasn't trying to be -16    A.   Oh, I didn't see that.
17    Q.   Okay. All right. Then I want
18 to go to page -- I'm going to jump around
19 just a little bit and put into perspective
20 everything that's been dispersed into the
21 environment here.
22        Let's go to page 45 of 158.
23        And you see that chart. That's
24 a summary of the breaching damage and
25 hazardous materials released as a result of
|Page 107 1 Q. Okay. And there's some attempt 2 to try to point out where the vinyl chloride 3 cars are and where other cars are, right? 4 A. Correct. 5 Q. Okay. Let's go over to 9 of 6 158. And there's a chart down there at the 7 bottom that I'd like you to pull out, and it 8 says this is the bill of lading on the vinyl 9 chloride cars. And let's see if it checks 10 with the list you brought here to your 11 deposition, sir. 12 Car 28, TILX car; 29, 30, an 13 Oxy car; 31's GATX car; and 55 is an Oxy car. 14 Does that match your list? 15 A. It does. 16 Q. Okay. And if we look at this, 17 based upon the bill of lading -- and that's a 18 document that describes what's inside the 19 tank cars. 20 C o r r e c t ? 21 A. Correct. 22 Q. It says that the five vinyl 23 chloride cars, they had a -- between 178,300 24 net weight down to -- I think the smallest 25 one was 176.|Page 109 1 the derailment. It has the five vinyl 2 chloride cars, but it also has these other 3 hazardous materials that were released. 4 Do you see that? 5 A. I do. 6 Q. Car 36, 38 and 50? 7 A. Yes. 8 Q. All right. And then if we go 9 to page 56 of 158, there's a summary of the 10 nonhazardous commodity tank car breaches. 11 Do you see that? 12 A. I do. 13 Q. And it says the entire load of 14 propylene glycol was dumped onto the ground, 15 petroleum lube and these other chemicals, the 16 entire load, because these cars were actually 17 damaged to where they were punctured, to 18 where the contents spilled on their own out 19 onto the ground. 20 R ig h t ? 21 MS. PUJARI: Objection. 22 Compound. 23 THE WITNESS: Could you restate 24 the question? 25|

1 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:
2    Q.   Yeah, it wasn't a very good
3 question. I'll withdraw it.
4        This is just other materials
5 from other cars other than the vinyl chloride
6 cars that were breached and released their
7 l o a d .
8        R i g h t ?
9    A.   Correct.
10    Q.   And all of these cars, the
11 reason we have a fire out there is because of
12 the wheel bearing being on fire.
13        Right?
14        MS. PUJARI: Objection. Calls
15    for expert testimony. Lack of
16    foundation.
17        THE WITNESS: Yeah, I don't
18    know why -- if that's the only reason
19    we have a fire.
20 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:
21    Q.   Well, can you think of any
22 other reason?
23        MS. PUJARI: Objection. Calls
24    for -25


1    Q.   Right.
2    A.   I can't tell you if there -- I
3 mean, to answer your question is, I don't
4 know. I don't think the investigation is
5 complete to say this was the cause.
6    Q.   Nine months into it, Norfolk
7 Southern doesn't accept the fact that the
8 wheel bearing that was on fire that we all
9 just saw didn't cause this fire?
10        MS. PUJARI: Objection.
11 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:
12    Q.   Is that Norfolk Southern's
13 testimony?
14        MS. PUJARI: Objection. Asked
15    and answered. Argumentative.
16        THE WITNESS: My testimony is
17    that, as I stated before, we saw the
18    pictures of the fire underneath the
19    railcar.
20 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:
21    Q.   Right.
22    A.   And to the extent could that
23 have been the ignition source for fires?
24 It's a possibility that that's -25    Q.   Okay.
|Page 111 1 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 2 Q. Kids weren't out there with 3 matches, were they? 4 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Calls 5 for speculation. 6 THE WITNESS: Repeat the 7 question for me, please. 8 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 9 Q. The only reason these cars are 10 on fire is because the wheel bearing was on 11 fire. That was the ignition source. 12 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Calls 13 for expert testimony. Asked and 14 answered. 15 THE WITNESS: I don't know that 16 to be the case. 17 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 18 Q. Do you know of any other 19 ignition source other than the wheel bearing 20 we all saw on the video that was on fire? 21 A. Again, I think this is being 22 investigated. Anytime you have a derailment, 23 there are going to be cars hitting the 24 ground, hitting ballast, hitting all sorts of 25 things, tanks being punctured.|Page 113 1 A. -- that was the ignition 2 source. 3 Q. Okay. Thank you. 4 Let's go back -- now I'm going 5 backwards a little bit, I'm sorry, but I want 6 to go back to page 12 and 13 of 58 {sic}. 7 And this is some of the other 8 chemicals that were hazardous materials that 9 were breached and burned and that was 10 contained in this report, this hazardous 11 material report, that you reviewed. 12 Correct? 13 A. So what paragraph are you 14 referencing? 15 Q. Page 12. I want to go 3.2.1, 16 ethylene glycol monobutyl ether physical and 17 chemical properties. That was one of the 18 tank cars that breached and burned. 19 See that? 20 A. I see that. 21 Q. And then I just want to go over 22 to page 13 under General Hazards. 23 "The product is toxic." 24 Do you see that? 25 A. I do see that.|
|---|---|


-----

1    Q.   "Fumes and vapors are heavier
2 than air."
3        Do you see that?
4    A.   I do.
5    Q.   The very last sentence of that
6 paragraph, "It may" -- this can -- "It may
7 cause headache, dizziness, incoordination,
8 nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and general
9 weakness."
10        Do you see that, sir?
11    A.   I do.
12    Q.   Then if you go up a little bit
13 in that paragraph, it begins with "The SDS"
14 on the right side of that paragraph.
15        No, the next SDS. There you
16 go. Follow along.
17        "The SDS states that ethylene
18 glycol monobutyl ether is regarded as the
19 most toxic of all glycol ethers."
20        Do you see that?
21    A.   I do see that.
22    Q.   All right. That's just one of
23 the tank cars that burned, right?
24        MS. PUJARI: Objection.
25    Assumes facts not in evidence.


1    A.   I do.
2    Q.   All right. Let's go to 16 of
3 158, 3. -- 3.5.1, butyl acrylate.
4        Do you see that?
5    A.   Yes.
6    Q.   Right there in the middle.
7 "Contact with butyl acrylate may cause skin
8 irritation, allergic skin reaction, serious
9 eye irritation, respiratory irritation. May
10 be harmful if inhaled. It's harmful to
11 aquatic life, with long-lasting effects."
12        Do you see that?
13    A.   I do.
14    Q.   You read the news reports of
15 all the dead fish in the streams, didn't you,
16 after this derailment?
17    A.   I read some news reports that
18 had mentioned aquatic life.
19    Q.   All right. Then let's go over
20 to page 17 of 158 where they start talking
21 about the vinyl chloride.
22        Okay?
23        And the actual name of what was
24 in the -- what we refer to as the vinyl
25 chloride tank cars was a substance known as
|Page 115 1 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 2 Q. Okay? 3 A. I think that was a product 4 involved in the derailment. I don't see any 5 reference to the tank car on this. 6 Q. Well, there's no reason it 7 would be in the hazardous materials report 8 for this derailment if it wasn't part of the 9 derailment, would it, sir? 10 A. No. 11 Q. All right. Let's go to the 14 12 to 158, 3.31. 13 This is my favorite. 14 Ethylhexyl. My Aunt Ethel, it reminds me of 15 her every time. 16 Ethylhexyl acrylate and the 17 physical and chemical properties. 18 Do you see that? 19 A. I do. 20 Q. Down at the bottom of that 21 section it says, "The SDS states that 22 ethylhexyl acrylate may cause skin 23 irritation, allergic skin reaction and 24 respiratory irritation." 25 Do you see that?|Page 117 1 vinyl chloride monomer. 2 Correct? 3 A. Correct. 4 Q. And throughout this litigation, 5 I've seen some places in the reports they 6 refer to that as VCM. 7 Have you seen that? 8 A. I have. 9 Q. Okay. So we're talking about 10 the vinyl chloride. And let's go to the next 11 page, page 18 of 50 -- of 158. 12 And let's talk about the 13 paragraph that starts at Section 2, the vinyl 14 chloride monomer, SDS. Talks about the 15 problems that they put in their SDS. 16 Let's look at that. Bullet 17 point 1. "Vinyl chloride is a known human 18 cancer agent." 19 Do you see that? 20 A. I do. 21 Q. Next dot. "May produce, among 22 other things, central nervous system 23 depression, including headaches, dizziness, 24 nausea, loss of balance and drowsiness." 25 Do you see that, sir?|

-----

1    A.   Yes.
2    Q.   Pretty significant health
3 hazard associated with vinyl chloride monomer
4 exposure.
5        Correct?
6        MS. PUJARI: Objection. Calls
7    for expert testimony. Vague as to
8    "significant."
9        THE WITNESS: Can you repeat
10    the question?
11 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:
12    Q.   I'll make it easier. Would you
13 want to inhale that stuff?
14        MS. BROZ: Objection.
15        MS. PUJARI: I'm sorry.
16        Objection. Form.
17        THE WITNESS: No, there's no
18    question here, based on the safety
19    data sheet, that this is a hazardous
20    chemical, extremely flammable gas.
21    Polymerization can occur.
22 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:
23    Q.   Oh, we're going to get into
24 that.
25    A.   It's...


1        Do you see that?
2    A.   I do.
3    Q.   Have you ever heard of phosgene
4 gas?
5    A.   I have seen it in documents to
6 include the SDS.
7    Q.   All right. So let's go to
8 page 74 of this document. 74, 158.
9        Yep, that's it. I want to talk
10 about the incident response.
11        When we're talking about the
12 incident here, this is the response to the
13 derailment.
14        Right?
15    A.   Correct.
16    Q.   8.1 talks about the initial
17 railroad response actions. It looks like in
18 the first bullet point, Norfolk Southern
19 hired a contractor, SPSI.
20        Do you see that?
21    A.   I do.
22    Q.   Okay. Let's move over to
23 page 76 of 158.
24        At the top it says, "On
25 February 5, 2023, at 18:00, Norfolk Southern

Form. 5 THE WITNESS: Again, as the SDS 6 states, it's a -- it has all sorts -- 7 it presents physical hazards. 8 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 9 Q. Okay. Let's go to page 20, 10 158, up at the top. It talks about hazardous 11 decomposition products of vinyl chloride. 12 Do you see that? 13 A. Can you state that again? 14 Q. Yeah. Hazardous decomposition 15 products. 16 A. Okay. I do. 17 Q. And it tells you what they are. 18 Oxides of carbon. 19 Right? 20 A. Correct. 21 Q. Chlorine? 22 A. Correct. 23 Q. Hydrogen chlorine? 24 A. Correct. 25 Q. And phosphene.|Page 121 1 system manager for hazardous material was" -- 2 "reported the following." 3 Is that Robert Wood? That 4 would be his title, wouldn't it? 5 A. I can't remember his exact 6 title at Norfolk Southern, but he -- again, 7 he works within our hazardous materials 8 group. 9 Q. Okay. But February 5th -- 10 let's put this in perspective -- the 11 derailment is at, let's call it, nine o'clock 12 Friday night, correct? That's February 3rd? 13 A. Correct. 14 Q. So February 5th is a Sunday, 15 right? 16 A. I believe that is -- yes. 17 Q. And at 18:00, that's military 18 time, so that would be 6 p.m. on Sunday. 19 Right? 20 A. Correct. 21 Q. And what's going on here is 22 they're -- that the contractors at NS are 23 monitoring the VCM tank cars, the vinyl 24 chloride tank cars, to figure out what to do 25 with them.|

1        Correct?
2    A.   I believe there was a lot of
3 things still going on, but was there -- was
4 there a monitoring of the vinyl tank cars at
5 the same time? Yes.
6    Q.   Right.
7        And what was determined after
8 the derailment, that all five tank cars that
9 contained the vinyl chloride, every single
10 one of them withstood the derailment and
11 there was no breach. In other words, none of
12 the vinyl chloride spilled out onto the
13 g r o u n d .
14        T r u e ?
15        MS. PUJARI: Objection.
16    Compound. Calls for speculation.
17        THE WITNESS: I have not read
18    anything that would indicate there was
19    a breach.
20 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:
21    Q.   Okay. Well, we'll get into
22 that then.
23        Have you read anything that
24 suggests that the vinyl chloride cars were
25 breached and were leaking?


1 bottom of the car, and blew 2-inch holes into
2 the side of these cars, steel cars.
3        R i g h t ?
4    A.   I would say that's a better -5 a more accurate description, set off
6 discharges to open two holes, one at the top,
7 one at the bottom, for a vent and burn. I
8 would not describe that as blowing up
9 r a i l c a r s .
10    Q.   Well, you blew two holes into
11 the railcars, steel railcars, and set them on
12 fire, right? "You" being NS?
13        MS. PUJARI: Objection to the
14    characterization. Asked and answered.
15    Argumentative.
16        THE WITNESS: I would say we
17    conducted a successful vent and burn.
18 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:
19    Q.   Successful?
20    A.   Yes.
21    Q.   Successful.
22        How do you define -- how does
23 Norfolk Southern define "success"?
24    A.   When you're trying to conduct a
25 vent and burn, you obviously have -- you have
|Page 123 1 MS. PUJARI: Objection. 2 Compound. 3 THE WITNESS: Not prior to the 4 vent and burn. 5 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 6 Q. Not until you blew them up. 7 R ig h t ? 8 MS. PUJARI: Objection. 9 Objection to the characterization. 10 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 11 Q. Well, that's what NS did. They 12 put dynamite on these cars and blew two holes 13 in them. 14 R ig h t ? 15 A. I would say -- 16 MS. PUJARI: Objection to the 17 characterization. 18 You can answer. 19 THE WITNESS: Yeah, I would say 20 vent and burn is not blowing up a 21 r a i lc a r . 22 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 23 Q. Well, you put explosives in the 24 top of the car, "you" being NS and your 25 contractors, at the top of the car and at the|Page 125 1 personnel in harm's way with a purpose of, 2 again, creating through those set explosives 3 an opening on one end -- on top of the car 4 and on the bottom so any other product or 5 lading can drain. 6 Q. And burn? 7 A. Drain. 8 Q. And burn? 9 A. And burn. 10 Q. Into the environment. Into the 11 village of East Palestine, right? Right 12 d o w n t o w n . 13 MS. PUJARI: Objection. 14 Argumentative. 15 And please let the witness 16 complete his answer. 17 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 18 Q. This happened -- excuse me. Go 19 ahead. Finish your -- 20 A. So when I say it was 21 successful, what I'm referring to is the vent 22 and burn, as designed, was implemented. 23 There was no -- at the time, we didn't have 24 individuals setting those charges. They did 25 them, you know, as they were to supposed to|
|---|---|


-----

1 do. And when I say it's a success, is the
2 planned vent and burn went according to plan.
3    Q.   But I want to get into the
4 decision why the vent and burn ever became
5 the plan.
6        Can we talk about that?
7    A.   Sure.
8    Q.   All right. Because it says
9 right here on page 76 of 158 that to conduct
10 a vent and burn, that's the last resort.
11        Do you see that in there?
12        MS. PUJARI: Can you
13    reference -14        THE WITNESS: Could you
15    point -16 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:
17    Q.   Yeah. It's the one, two -18 third bullet point. Right there.
19    A.   I see that.
20    Q.   All right. So let's move on a
21 little bit.
22        MS. PUJARI: And, Counsel,
23    could you orient us to the paragraphs
24    of the complaint that you are focused
25    on at the moment under the notice?


1 to you just a little bit about that. It's
2 the Specialized Response Solutions, SRS,
3 actions.
4        Do you see that paragraph?
5    A.   I do see the paragraph.
6    Q.   And that was another contractor
7 that Norfolk Southern brought on to respond
8 to the derailment.
9        Is that right?
10    A.   That's correct.
11    Q.   So we have SPSI as one
12 contractor NS hired, and we have SRS as
13 another one.
14        Correct?
15    A.   That is my understanding, yes.
16    Q.   Okay. And in the first
17 paragraph it says the first thing that SRS
18 did was to do a damage assessment of the
19 vinyl chloride cars, formulate wrecking,
20 clearing plans and identify loads versus
21 empties within the derailment.
22        Correct?
23    A.   That's what's written, yes.
24    Q.   And then the next paragraph,
25 the senior project manager observed active
|Page 127 1 MR. DENTON: All of these. It 2 all talks about derailment response. 3 It starts at paragraph 72. This is 4 all part of the derailment response, 5 72 through 100 and something. 120, 6 137, 185. 7 MS. PUJARI: Thank you, 8 Counsel. 9 MR. DENTON: You're welcome. 10 Let's take a short break. 11 Could we? 12 MS. PUJARI: Sure. 13 VIDEOGRAPHER: 11:44, we are 14 off the video record. 15 (Off the record at 11:44 a.m.) 16 VIDEOGRAPHER: 11:57, we are on 17 the video record. 18 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 19 Q. All right, sir, I want to 20 continue with talking to you about the 21 Exhibit 13, which is this hazardous materials 22 group report that you told us you reviewed. 23 And I want to go to page 82 of 24 158, if you could join me there, please. 25 And it's 8.2.2. I want to talk|Page 129 1 fires involving materials constructed of 2 wood, plastic pellets -- 3 That was what was in the hopper 4 car, correct, plastic pellets? 5 A. Correct. 6 Q. Railroad ties, lubricating oil, 7 glycols, acrylates. 8 So they're still burning on 9 February 5th, the morning of February 5th, 10 which was Sunday morning. 11 Right? 12 A. Yes, that's what's written. 13 Q. Okay. Let's go to the next -- 14 let's skip a couple pages. Let's go to 86 of 15 158, and I want to talk to you about 8.3, Oxy 16 Vinyl communications. 17 Do you see that? 18 A. I do see that. 19 Q. And just to orientate the jury, 20 Oxy Vinyls is the shipper of the vinyl 21 chloride monomer that was in the five tank 22 cars. 23 Correct? 24 A. Correct. 25 Q. In fact, Oxy Vinyls is also the|
|---|---|


-----

1 manufacturer of that product. That's the
2 business they're in, is to make and ship VCM.
3        Right?
4    A.   I believe that's a product -5 I'm not quite sure if Oxy Vinyls only
6 produces -7    Q.   Well, I'm not sure it's the
8 only thing -9    A.   -- the vinyl chloride -10    Q.   -- but certainly that's one of
11 their products?
12    A.   Yes.
13    Q.   Okay. And certainly one would
14 expect that Oxy Vinyls would understand the
15 properties of a hazardous material that it
16 manufactures and ships across the country.
17        Wouldn't you agree with that
18 concept, sir?
19        MS. PUJARI: Objection to the
20    extent it calls for speculation.
21        THE WITNESS: I believe they're
22    required to communicate hazards
23    related to that product for shipping
24    purposes.
25


1    Q.   About the characteristics of
2 vinyl chloride monomer.
3        Right?
4    A.   Right.
5    Q.   It goes on to say that the Oxy
6 Vinyls team met with SPSI and SRS to discuss
7 the derailed tank cars.
8        Right?
9    A.   It does state that they met
10 with them to obtain a situation briefing,
11 yes.
12    Q.   All right. Then I want to go
13 to page 88 of 158, because Oxy was notified
14 that the Norfolk Southern contractors and
15 Norfolk Southern wanted to conduct a vent and
16 burn, in other words, put dynamite charges on
17 two places on these railcars and burn up the
18 product.
19        That was the communication that
20 was going on and the decision whether or not
21 to do that.
22        Right?
23    A.   What paragraph are you
24 referencing?
25    Q.   I'm not referring to any
|Page 131 1 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 2 Q. But wouldn't you expect, sir, 3 as a Norfolk Southern representative, that 4 Oxy Vinyls, the manufacturer of this product, 5 would be a subject expert on the properties 6 of that VCM? 7 A. Yes. 8 Q. Okay. And so let's discuss 9 that. 10 We know that at some point 11 there was communication from Norfolk Southern 12 to Oxy Vinyls about the derailment. 13 Correct? 14 A. Correct. 15 Q. And in fact, at 8.3.1, it shows 16 that Oxy Vinyls had three representatives at 17 the derailment site on February 5th between 18 14:00 and 14:30. 19 Do you see that? 20 That's 2 to 2:30 on Sunday, 21 there's actually Oxy Vinyls folks present in 22 East Palestine, Ohio, right, to provide 23 technical assistance? 24 Right? 25 A. I see that.|Page 133 1 paragraph. I'm just referring to what was 2 going on. 3 A. I don't know -- 4 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Vague 5 as to time. 6 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 7 Q. You don't know? 8 A. I don't know what the 9 discussions was with Oxy Vinyls throughout 10 the whole period. 11 Q. I understand that. 12 A. So that's why I'm asking -- 13 Q. Okay. Well, I'm just trying 14 to -- yeah, let me withdraw the question. 15 Let me help you. Okay? Fair enough. I'm 16 just trying to set the stage. 17 One of the -- the discussion 18 that was really going on between the NS and 19 its contractors and Oxy Vinyls was, what do 20 we do with the five derailed vinyl chloride 21 cars and the VCM that's within them. 22 That was the general topic, 23 right? 24 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Vague 25 as to time.|
|---|---|


-----

1        THE WITNESS: Again, I don't
2    know what the -- the discussions that
3    took place. All I can say is that I
4    know Oxy Vinyls sent representatives.
5        I would assume that the NS
6    contractors and NS personnel and the
7    response team there would have been
8    having discussions ongoing -9 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:
10    Q.   Right.
11    A.   -- from the start of the
12 derailment.
13        Again, once Oxy Vinyls'
14 representatives got there, they would
15 probably have been included in some
16 discussions.
17    Q.   Well, let's go back to page 86
18 of 158. Let's just look what the report
19 provided that you reviewed.
20        It says, quote, down at the
21 bottom, "The Oxy Vinyls team met with SPSI
22 president, SRS representatives, for a
23 briefing." Held it at the SPSI office in a
24 trailer.
25        What were the topics they


1 representative of SRS.
2    A.   And you stated who else from -3    Q.   That was it. That's all I
4 stated.
5    A.   So the Oxy Vinyls team -6    Q.   It says the Oxy Vinyls team,
7 which the paragraph above says three
8 individuals, and the president of SPSI and
9 SRS, they all got together to talk about
10 topics, which are those four bullet points
11 that we have highlighted on the screen.
12        Right?
13    A.   I don't dispute that.
14    Q.   Okay. Very good.
15        MR. DENTON: I need a short
16    break. My numbers are out of order.
17    Give me just a second off the record.
18        VIDEOGRAPHER: 12:07, we are
19    off the video record.
20     (Off the record at 12:07 p.m.)
21        VIDEOGRAPHER: 12:09, we are on
22    the video record.
23 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:
24    Q.   Let's go to page 90 of 158, the
25 bottom paragraph.
|Page 135 1 discussed? Location of the derailed tank 2 cars; the temperatures of the vinyl chloride 3 tank cars; concerns about polymerization of 4 the tank cars; and the possibility of 5 conducting a vent and burn of the VCM tank 6 cars. 7 So that's what they were 8 talking about, right? 9 A. That's what's written here. I 10 would assume that's correct. 11 Q. Well, you're the Norfolk 12 Southern representative. That's in fact what 13 happened, right? 14 MS. PUJARI: Objection to form. 15 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 16 Q. And this is the report you said 17 you studied, and Robert Wood was a member of 18 the team. 19 Do you have any reason to 20 dispute this report? 21 A. I don't dispute what's written 22 on this paper. I don't know who was involved 23 in that briefing with Oxy Vinyls. 24 Q. Well, it says right here on 25 this paper. The SPSI president. A|Page 137 1 It's talking about the next 2 contact between the Oxy Vinyls Dallas team 3 and SPSI occurred on the early morning of 4 February 5, 2023. 5 Do you see that? 6 A. I do see that. 7 Q. Same individuals, mostly, who 8 participated on the February 4th call. 9 Do you see that? 10 A. I do. 11 Q. And it says, "SPSI raised the 12 topic of the VCM polymerization within the 13 tank cars and the possibility of conducting a 14 vent and burn." 15 Do you see where I'm at? 16 A. I do see that. 17 Q. And Oxy Vinyls, who 18 manufactured the VCM and shipped the VCM, 19 said, quote, in re -- well, no quote. 20 In response, the Oxy Vinyls 21 senior vice president of manufacturing, who 22 wasn't on the February 4th, reportedly 23 interjected, quote -- follow me? -- "Let me 24 be clear. Polymerization is not occurring," 25 end quote.|

1        Can you underline that in red,
2 please, Michael, that quote?
3        Do you see that?
4    A.   I do see it written here, yes.
5    Q.   Okay. So the senior vice
6 president of manufacturing at Oxy Vinyls, the
7 company that makes this product, this VCM, is
8 making it perfectly clear that polymerization
9 is not occurring.
10        Correct? That's what he told
11 NS and its contractors.
12        MS. PUJARI: Objection to the
13    characterization. The document speaks
14    for itself.
15 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:
16    Q.   Right?
17    A.   That's what's written here.
18    Q.   And polymerization was the
19 reason that -- well, strike that. Let me
20 withdraw that.
21        Let's go on to this same
22 paragraph. And it says, last sentence,
23 "According to the Oxy Vinyls vice president
24 Hess, he further suggested that if a vent and
25 burn is being considered, it should be done


1        But go ahead.
2        THE WITNESS: The reason I
3    wanted the question asked again is, I
4    would not state -- I can't necessarily
5    agree with "the leading expert." I
6    would say that, as I stated before,
7    Oxy Vinyl obviously has expertise in
8    vinyl chloride.
9        I know we have a statement here
10    from -- according to the Oxy Vinyls
11    vice president Hess, he suggested.
12    And I read what's written here, and I
13    agree what's written here.
14        But I would just again state, I
15    don't necessarily agree with "the
16    leading expert of vinyl chloride."
17 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:
18    Q.   Okay. Certainly an expert of
19 vinyl chloride?
20    A.   I would agree that he has some
21 expertise in vinyl chloride.
22    Q.   All right. And let's be
23 perfectly clear. He said, quote, "Let me be
24 me clear. Polymerization is not occurring,"
25 end quote.
|Page 139 1 because of" -- "not be done" -- not, 2 underline "not" because I misspoke -- "not be 3 done because of polymerization, because 4 polymerization is not occurring." 5 Right? 6 A. That's what's written. 7 Q. So the subject matter expert on 8 VCM, vice president of manufacturing, made it 9 perfectly clear to NS and its contractors 10 there was no need to vent and burn these tank 11 cars. 12 MS. PUJARI: Objection. 13 Mischaracterizes the document. 14 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 15 Q. Correct, sir? 16 A. Can you restate the question? 17 MR. DENTON: Thank you, Carrie. 18 (Court Reporter read back 19 question.) 20 MS. PUJARI: Mischaracterizes 21 the document. 22 THE WITNESS: Yeah, I would -- 23 MR. DENTON: If that's not a 24 leading -- or a speaking objection, I 25 don't know what it is.|Page 141 1 Right? 2 A. That's what is stated here, 3 yes. 4 Q. All right. And there was no 5 reason to vent and burn these tank cars 6 because of a polymerization. It would have 7 to be for some other reason. 8 Right? 9 That's -- that was the position 10 of Oxy Vinyls, correct? 11 A. I believe that is the position 12 of Mr. -- Vice President Hess at Oxy Vinyls. 13 Q. Well, let's see what happened 14 after that. Let's go to the next page, 15 page 91. 16 The on-site team from Oxy 17 Vinyls -- it's the second full paragraph, 18 last two lines. The outcome of that meeting 19 on February 5th was "an agreement that Oxy 20 Vinyls' on-site team would continue to convey 21 the message to SPSI that there was no signs 22 of polymerization occurring within the tank 23 cars." 24 Do you see that? 25 A. I do see that.|
|---|---|


-----

1    Q.   So Oxy Vinyls is telling NS and
2 its two contractors, no polymerization,
3 right?
4        MS. PUJARI: Objection.
5 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:
6    Q.   That's what they're saying to
7 them. That's the advice they're giving them.
8        MS. PUJARI: Objection.
9    Mischaracterization as to Oxy Vinyls.
10        THE WITNESS: I guess the -- my
11    response would be the meeting that
12    you're referring to, the outcome of
13    that meeting was an agreement that the
14    Oxy Vinyls on-site team would convey
15    the message to SPSI that there was no
16    signs of polymerization occurring
17    within the tank cars.
18 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:
19    Q.   All right. And then it goes on
20 to say, last sentence of that paragraph, "At
21 this point, SPSI and Norfolk Southern did not
22 direct any further questions or provide any
23 situation updates to the Oxy Vinyls Dallas
24 team."
25        Do you see that?


1 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:
2    Q.   Right?
3    A.   I think the answer to that is
4 they were basically making a claim, Mr. Hess
5 and the vice president, that polymerization
6 was not occurring.
7    Q.   Right.
8        That was Oxy Vinyls' position,
9 right?
10    A.   That was not everybody from -11 that I'm -- I can speak to would say that was
12 everybody at Oxy Vinyl on that on-site team,
13 but those individuals made those statements,
14 as I read earlier.
15    Q.   The on-site team from Oxy and
16 the vice president of manufacturing in Dallas
17 on a conference call, all the Oxy people
18 said, no polymerization, no need to vent and
19 burn.
20        Right?
21        MS. PUJARI: Objection.
22    Misstates evidence.
23        THE WITNESS: You had an
24    on-site Oxy Vinyl representative prior
25    to that meeting making the claim that
|Page 143 1 A. I do see that. 2 Q. And so this was -- that was on 3 February 5th. So let's move forward to 4 page 93 of 158, the decision to vent and burn 5 the tank cars. 6 So here we are. Oxy Vinyls 7 says, don't vent and burn. They're not asked 8 back to any of the meetings. 9 And then SPSI and SRS and 10 Norfolk make plans to go forward to go ahead 11 and vent and burn the tank cars, right? 12 MS. PUJARI: Objection. 13 Compound and misstates prior evidence. 14 THE WITNESS: Could you repeat 15 the question, please? 16 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 17 Q. All right. So we know Oxy 18 Vinyls has said -- their vice president of 19 manufacturing said, no polymerization, no 20 need to vent and burn. 21 That's where we're at from 22 their point of view, right? 23 MS. PUJARI: Objection. 24 Misstates evidence. 25|Page 145 1 he was not sure or he was -- he 2 couldn't say with a definite response 3 that polymerization was not occurring 4 or could not occur. 5 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 6 Q. And that's why you got Mr. Hess 7 down in Dallas on the phone, the main man 8 down at Oxy, for this chemical said, don't 9 blow them up, they're not going to 10 polymerize. 11 Right? 12 MS. PUJARI: Objection. 13 Misstates evidence. Prior testimony 14 and lack of foundation. 15 THE WITNESS: I don't believe 16 that -- that having the main man 17 somewhere else at a location that's 18 not on site takes away from the fact 19 that you had an on-site rep that 20 wasn't sure. 21 I believe what you stated is 22 what's written here, that he made the 23 statement -- 24 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 25 Q. Right.|
|---|---|


-----

1    A.   -- at some point that
2 polymerization was not occurring.
3    Q.   Right.
4        And as soon as that statement
5 was made, the Oxy Vinyl people on scene were
6 excluded from all further discussions with
7 Norfolk Southern and its contractors.
8        Correct?
9        MS. PUJARI: Objection.
10    Misstates evidence.
11        MR. DENTON: It does not. It's
12    right in the report. Quit making
13    those stupid objections.
14        MS. PUJARI: Excuse me? I will
15    make the objections that I am
16    permitted and allowed to make.
17        MR. DENTON: Let's go -- I'll
18    withdraw the question so your
19    objection -20        MS. PUJARI: You'll withdraw
21    the bullying, sir.
22        MR. DENTON: Oh, fine. I'll
23    withdraw the question.
24 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:
25    Q.   Let's go back to page 91 of


1    A.   Again, I don't take any issue
2 with what's written here as far as that
3 meeting and what was dis -4    Q.   Okay. Thank you.
5    A.   -- what was written.
6    Q.   All right. So at some point
7 there was a meeting between NS and its
8 contractors, SPSI and SRS, with the local
9 fire chief, Chief Drabick, concerning the
10 vent and burn. And I'm referring you to
11 page 94 of 158.
12        Are you with me?
13    A.   I'm on page 94. If you could
14 point me to -15    Q.   Yeah, we'll go to the middle
16 paragraph.
17    A.   Okay.
18    Q.   It says, "According to the
19 IC" -- that's the incident command, which was
20 Chief Drabick, the fire chief of East
21 Palestine -- "the SPSI president and the SRS
22 project manager insisted that he only had
23 13 minutes to decide whether to allow the
24 vent and burn to proceed because they wanted
25 to begin at 15:00 and before sunset to avoid
|Page 147 1 158. 2 "Following that meeting, the 3 Oxy Vinyl Dallas team was not informed of 4 further temperature monitoring of data 5 collected, and at that point the NS and SPSI 6 did not direct any further questions or 7 provide any situation updates to the Oxy 8 Vinyls Dallas team." 9 That's exactly what I just 10 said, didn't I? 11 A. So following -- following that 12 meeting -- and I don't disagree with anything 13 that's written here. 14 Q. Okay. 15 A. If you could repeat the 16 question, though, because, again, we have two 17 different people, and you said "following 18 that meeting." 19 What exact meeting, other than 20 this -- the meeting that we were referenced 21 on page 91? 22 Q. Right. 23 The one where he said, let's be 24 perfectly clear, they're not polymerizing. 25 That meeting.|Page 149 1 atmospheric temperature inversions and vapor 2 cloud to disperse." 3 Is that right? Is that what 4 happened, sir? 13 minutes? 5 A. I don't dispute what's written 6 here. 7 Q. Go down to the next paragraph. 8 "The incident commander said that at no 9 point," at no point, "did any official from 10 Oxy Vinyls have discussions with him or the 11 unified command. He said there was no 12 dissenting opinion provided to him about 13 polymerization." 14 Right? 15 A. Could you point out that on 16 page 94 where -- 17 Q. Yeah, I sure can. Let's go to 18 down to one, two, three -- fourth paragraph. 19 "The IC told the investigators that at no 20 point did an official from Oxy Vinyls have 21 discussions with him." That's Chief Drabick. 22 "He stated there were no dissenting opinion 23 provided to him about whether polymerization 24 was occurring within the tank cars." 25 Do you see that?|
|---|---|


-----

1    A.   I do see that.
2    Q.   Well, there sure as heck was a
3 dissenting opinion from Oxy Vinyls; it just
4 wasn't shared with the chief, was it?
5    A.   What's written here is the IC
6 told investigators that at no point did any
7 official from Oxy Vinyl have discussions with
8 the IC or unified staff command.
9    Q.   Right.
10        So what happened here, if we
11 summarize this, you go to Chief Drabick, you
12 give him 13 minutes. You don't give him the
13 dissenting opinion from Oxy Vinyl, and you,
14 "you" being NS, say, is it okay if we blow up
15 these tank cars?
16        MS. PUJARI: Objection.
17    Misstates evidence, the document and
18    prior testimony, and compound.
19        THE WITNESS: I don't agree
20    with that statement.
21 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:
22    Q.   What do you disagree with? He
23 had 13 minutes -24    A.   It's not the -- the fact that
25 you're saying everything was -- the decision


1    because I'm not quite sure what you're
2    referencing.
3        Can you explain to me -4 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:
5    Q.   They set up Chief Drabick to
6 get his permission to blow up the railcar so
7 you could get the track back open. That's
8 the setup.
9        MS. PUJARI: Objection.
10    Numerous objections to form.
11        THE WITNESS: Okay. I disagree
12    with that statement.
13 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:
14    Q.   You disagree with that?
15    A.   I do disagree with that.
16    Q.   He was given 13 minutes, right?
17 That's what this document says.
18        MS. PUJARI: Objection.
19    Misstates -20 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:
21    Q.   Right?
22        MS. PUJARI: Objection.
23    Misstates the document.
24        MR. DENTON: Well, let's read
25    the document, this one that I'm
|Page 151 1 was made in 13 minutes was -- 2 Q. That's what it says -- 3 A. Chief Drabick was the incident 4 commander. He was there from the start up 5 until this time. And I do believe there were 6 discussions that took place with the IC 7 commander, Chief Drabick, throughout the 8 derailment response. 9 Q. That may be true, but according 10 to Chief Drabick -- read it right here in 11 this document -- they gave him 13 minutes to 12 decide. 13 minutes with no dissenting view 13 from Oxy Vinyls. 14 MS. PUJARI: Objection. 15 Misstates. 16 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 17 Q. That's the setup, right? 18 MS. PUJARI: Objection. 19 Misstates the entire document. 20 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 21 Q. That's what happened, right? 22 MS. PUJARI: And prior 23 testimony. 24 THE WITNESS: I don't agree 25 with the term "that's the setup,"|Page 153 1 misstating. 2 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 3 Q. Quote, "He had only 13 minutes 4 to decide." 5 That's the third paragraph. 6 MS. PUJARI: Let's read the 7 whole document and the pages -- 8 MR. DENTON: All 158? Is 9 that -- go ahead, you can redirect him 10 on 158 pages. 11 MS. PUJARI: The pages -- pages 12 and pages -- 13 MR. DENTON: I'll withdraw it. 14 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 15 Q. It says right there the IC had 16 13 minutes to decide whether to allow a vent 17 and burn. That's exactly what it says. 18 Right? 19 A. You're leaving out the 20 vent/burn to proceed, so it's not as if he 21 was offered this vent and burn for the very 22 first time he had ever heard of vent and burn 23 and then has 13 minutes. So I disagree with 24 that. 25 Q. Even though it's written on|
|---|---|

1 that document right there? It says it. They
2 gave him 13 minutes.
3    A.   13 minutes to respond. I don't
4 dispute what's written on this document.
5    Q.   Okay. And then if we go down
6 to the other part that's highlighted. "At no
7 point did any official from Oxy Vinyls have
8 discussions with the chief. He stated there
9 were no dissenting opinions as to whether
10 polymerization was occurring within the tank
11 cars."
12        Correct?
13        That's what it says. That's
14 what happened.
15        Right?
16        MS. PUJARI: Objection.
17    Compound.
18        THE WITNESS: That's what's
19    written on the paper. And when I read
20    that, I think as anybody would read
21    that, that the entire incident team,
22    he had -- Chief Drabick himself had
23    not heard of any dissenting
24    opinions -25


1 the track reopened, getting the cars out of
2 the way, right?
3        MS. PUJARI: Objection.
4    Argumentative.
5 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:
6    Q.   Right?
7    A.   No, that is not a factor in a
8 vent and burn.
9    Q.   All right. Well, we'll test
10 you on that. How about -- no, not that one.
11 I'm talking status reports.
12        MS. PUJARI: Roger, I think
13    this is probably a good time to break
14    for lunch. It's 12:30.
15        Sound good?
16        MR. DENTON: Sure. It's your
17    witness.
18        How long do you want to take?
19        MS. PUJARI: 30.
20        MR. DENTON: 30?
21        MS. PUJARI: 30.
22        VIDEOGRAPHER: 12:29, we are
23    off the video record.
24     (Off the record at 12:29 p.m.)
25        VIDEOGRAPHER: 1:05, we are on
|Page 155 1 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 2 Q. And the dissenting -- 3 A. -- concerning polymerization. 4 Q. And the dissenting opinion came 5 from the people that made it, Oxy Vinyls, who 6 said, don't blow up the cars. There's no 7 polymerization. 8 That was the dissenting opinion 9 that NS didn't want the chief to hear, right? 10 MS. PUJARI: Objection. 11 Compound. Misstates evidence. 12 THE WITNESS: Your question 13 concerning the decision and no 14 dissenting opinions -- 15 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 16 Q. Uh-huh. 17 A. -- the decision to vent and 18 burn was not solely based on whether or not 19 polymerization was occurring or not. That 20 wasn't the single point that was made. Is 21 polymerization occurring or not? Okay. 22 We'll do a vent and burn. That wasn't the 23 only factor involved here in the incident. 24 Q. Right. 25 The other factor was getting|Page 157 1 the video record. 2 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 3 Q. So, sir, I want to go to 4 paragraph 97 of the third-party complaint, 5 which is page 21. It's highlighted in yellow 6 there. 7 Do you have a copy of that, 8 sir? 9 A. I do. 10 Q. And it says -- Norfolk Southern 11 says in this pleading that "At approximately 12 4:37 p.m. on February 6th, unified command 13 gave the green light to execute the vent and 14 burn, and the response team detonated the 15 controlled explosives of the five vinyl 16 chloride cars." 17 Do you see that? 18 A. I do see that. 19 Q. So basically if I'm 20 understanding this paragraph, help me if I'm 21 wrong, that on February 6th, at about 22 4:37 p.m., this is when the explosives went 23 off on the vinyl chloride cars and they were 24 burned. 25 Right?|

1    A.   I agree that what's written
2 there is written there, that that's -3    Q.   Well, you're the corporate rep.
4 Is that what happened? I'm just trying to
5 establish a time, really, a date and a time.
6    A.   At 4:37 p.m.?
7    Q.   Yeah.
8    A.   The unified command provided a
9 radio -- or provided by radio the official
10 green light to execute the vent and burn.
11    Q.   Let me ask you this, not
12 with -- keep the document, but not related to
13 the document.
14        Were you involved in any way in
15 responding to this derailment when it took
16 place?
17    A.   No, I was not.
18    Q.   No involvement whatsoever?
19    A.   No involvement.
20    Q.   So your only involvement was
21 because you were designated by the defendants
22 here to testify about these topics.
23        Correct?
24    A.   I was designated by our law
25 department to represent Norfolk Southern.


1        MS. PUJARI: Counsel, can I get
2    a copy?
3        MR. DENTON: Oh, yes.
4        MS. PUJARI: Thank you.
5        MR. DENTON: Sorry about that.
6        MS. PUJARI: No problem.
7        THE WITNESS: No, I don't
8    believe I reviewed this document.
9 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:
10    Q.   Okay. Well, we'll do it now
11 then.
12        Let's just look at the front
13 page. It's the -- it says it's the "Incident
14 Status Report, February 5th" -- this was
15 before the vent and burn. This is on
16 Sunday -- "2023."
17        And then if we go to page 2,
18 it's an NS Incident Status Report.
19        Do you see that?
20    A.   Page 1 of 7?
21    Q.   Yes, sir.
22    A.   I see that.
23    Q.   And it says right there at the
24 top, "Status report dated 2/5/2023."
25        Do you see that?
|Page 159 1 Q. Right. Okay. 2 And then if we go on to 3 paragraph 98 on that document, sir, again, 4 I'm just looking for time. It says, "The 5 released vinyl chloride burned through the 6 night of February 6th." 7 Do you see that? 8 A. I see that. 9 Q. So that's Monday night. The 10 derailment happened on the 3rd, Friday, the 11 4th, Saturday, the 5th was Sunday. Vent and 12 burn, 4:37 in the afternoon, and then the 13 cars burned all night. 14 Do you see that? 15 A. I see that. 16 (Dixon 30(b)(6) Exhibit 14 17 marked for identification.) 18 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 19 Q. Okay. So I want to show you 20 Exhibit 14, which is, for the record, 21 NS-CA-001621933 {sic}. Again, a document 22 that was in the range I was informed that you 23 had available for your review. 24 Do you remember reviewing this 25 document, sir?|Page 161 1 A. Yes. 2 Q. Okay. And this is a document 3 where someone in the field or somewhere is 4 keeping track of what's going on as a 5 response to this derailment. 6 Correct? 7 A. Correct. 8 Q. Okay. Let's go to page 4 of 7. 9 So again, this is Sunday, 10 before the decision to vent and burn on 11 Monday. Look at that at the top, "overall 12 site strategy and objectives." 13 Page 4 of 7, Michael. Right 14 there. There you go. Highlight that, 15 please. 16 Do you see that, sir? That's 17 what we're talking about. 18 A. I see that. 19 Q. The very first site objective 20 and strategy was "Remediating track bed and 21 rebuild track." 22 Do you see that? 23 MS. PUJARI: Objection. 24 Mischaracterizes the document. 25 Misreads the document.|

1 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:
2    Q.   "Sequencing of remediating
3 track bed versus rebuild track."
4        Did I read that correctly?
5    A.   That's what's written here.
6    Q.   "Objectives re:" -- r-e,
7 colon -- "timeline for reopening the line and
8 resuming traffic."
9        Do you see that?
10    A.   That's what's written here.
11    Q.   So the objective was to get the
12 track opened in the incident report, right?
13        MS. PUJARI: Objection.
14    Mischaracterizes the document.
15 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:
16    Q.   Well, let me read it again.
17        "Objectives: Timeline for
18 reopening line and resuming traffic."
19        Did I read that correctly?
20        MS. PUJARI: Objection.
21    Mischaracterizes the remainder of the
22    document.
23        THE WITNESS: Yeah, I read this
24    as sequencing of remediating track bed
25    versus rebuilding track.


1 of 7. The date of the report is 2/5/23.
2    A.   I agree. That's the -- that's
3 the date.
4    Q.   Okay. And let's look at
5 something else on page 3 of 7. Let's go
6 down. There's a box there with a yellow
7 highlighting across the top.
8        And it says right there on
9 February 5, 2023, on Sunday, that NS is
10 already scheduling a, quote, "Vent and burn
11 operation for 2/6/23."
12        They already made up the
13 decision before they ever talked to Chief
14 Drabick, didn't they?
15    A.   I don't know what was
16 communicated at -- to Chief Drabick or the
17 incident command. And again, this is the
18 first time I'm seeing this recovery plan
19 document.
20    Q.   Well, it was in the documents I
21 was told by the lawyers that was in the
22 package for you to review. That's number
23 one.
24        And number two, it's an NS
25 document, right?
|Page 163 1 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 2 Q. Right. 3 A. As the priority being 4 remediating track bed. 5 Q. But the objective, the next 6 line -- you see the title of this whole 7 section is "Overall Site Strategy and 8 Objectives." 9 Right? 10 That's what this document is 11 for, right? 12 A. That is what's written here -- 13 Q. Okay. 14 A. -- on the document. 15 Q. And let's read it one more 16 time. 17 The objectives, "Timeline for 18 reopening the line and resuming traffic." 19 Did I read that correctly? 20 A. That's what's written here. 21 Q. And that's February 5th. 22 That's Sunday, before there's ever a decision 23 to vent and burn. 24 Right? 25 I'll help you out. It's page 1|Page 165 1 A. That's what's on the header 2 here. 3 Q. Okay. And you don't have to 4 review it to understand what it means, quote, 5 "Vent and burn operation scheduled for 6 2/6/23," end quote. 7 So whoever wrote this knew that 8 that was going to happen the day before, 9 regardless of the meeting with Chief Drabick, 10 right? 11 A. I can't say for certain that 12 that's exactly what they knew. 13 MS. PUJARI: Counsel, one point 14 of clarification on Exhibit 9 -- 15 MR. DENTON: No, no, no, no, 16 no. No, no, no, no, no. You're not 17 going to educate the witness with a 18 speaking objection. Not going to 19 happen. 20 MS. PUJARI: No, it's just to 21 you, and we can go off the record if 22 you'd like. Or we can step outside. 23 MR. DENTON: Well, let's get 24 the witness out of here. 25 MS. PUJARI: Well, you and I|

18    Q.   Okay. And if you'll go to

20 and burn.
21        Do you see that one on page 6?
22 Do you see that?
23    A.   I see the picture.
24    Q.   Flames and dark smoke.

10    A.   I see the picture.
11    Q.   What do you see in that
12 picture?
13    A.   I see ballast.
14    Q.   A lot of ballast.
15    A.   I see -16    Q.   Would you agree that's a lot of
17 ballast, all of that white stone?
18        MS. PUJARI: Objection to the
19    characterization. The photo speaks
20    for itself.
21        THE WITNESS: I wouldn't
22    characterize that as a lot of ballast.
23    It's ballast.
24 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:
25    Q.   Okay. How many truckloads of
|Page 167 1 A. I see the picture on page 6, 2 y e s . 3 Q. The picture on the next page? 4 See that? 5 A. I see the picture, yes. 6 Q. The picture on the next page. 7 That's part of the explosion 8 from the vent and burn? 9 A. I see the picture. 10 Q. All right. Let's go to page 9 11 of 11. 12 You see that picture? 13 A. I see the picture on 9. 14 Q. And let's go to 10 and look at 15 the smoke plume from the residents in East 16 Palestine. In fact, there's one down there 17 in the bottom left taking a picture of it by 18 his cell phone by his car. 19 Do you see that picture that NS 20 p r o v id e d ? 21 A. I see the picture on page 10, 22 y e s . 23 (Dixon 30(b)(6) Exhibit 16 24 marked for identification.) 25|Page 169 1 ballast do you think are sitting there? 2 A. I couldn't even gather a guess 3 based off the size of the truck and the bed 4 of the truck. I don't know. 5 Q. Multiple truckloads? 6 A. I would say multiple, yes. 7 Q. Okay. What else do you see? 8 A. I see some individuals working. 9 Q. Right. 10 A. I see some equipment. 11 Q. Right. 12 A. And I see some track panels 13 and... 14 Q. Okay. For the jurors who may 15 not be familiar with railroad like you and I 16 are, what is a track panel, and where is it 17 in the picture? 18 A. It's on the left-hand side. 19 You see it sitting up top of -- of the rail 20 there. Those are rail ties and ribbon -- or 21 rail mounted to those ties. 22 Q. Right. 23 And what are track panels used 24 for, sir? 25 A. Track panels are used to lay|

1 track.
2    Q.   You bring in pre-made panels,
3 "you" being the Norfolk Southern or their
4 contractors, and use those to repair the
5 damaged rail?
6        Is that what they're for?
7    A.   Track panel is always used to
8 replace rail.
9    Q.   Okay. All right. So we have
10 however much ballast we have there. I see
11 two big CAT pieces of equipment. We see
12 three guys, at least, working. We see track
13 panels. And there's some equipment off in
14 the distance, maybe a third CAT.
15        What's the date of that
16 picture, sir?
17        I'll help you. It's written
18 right up there on the top right.
19    A.   I don't think that's the date
20 of the picture. That basically says, "On
21 Sunday, February the 5th, a smoldering tangle

23 carrying hazardous materials, has kept an

15    Q.   Let's go to 15 of 32.
16        MS. PUJARI: Exhibit 18?
17 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:
18    Q.   Do you see that?
19    A.   I see that.
20    Q.   That's just the smoke going up
21 from the vent and burn on February 6th,
22 Monday.
23        Do you see that?
24    A.   I see what's written on this
25 document.
|Page 171 1 authorities warily watch air quality 2 monitors," by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. 3 Q. Right. 4 A. So I don't know the date of 5 that picture. 6 Q. It says it right on there, 7 Sunday, February 5th. 8 Do you want to see all 32 9 pictures? 10 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Asked 11 and answered. Argumentative. 12 (Dixon 30(b)(6) Exhibit 17 13 marked for identification.) 14 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 15 Q. Let's get all 32 pictures out 16 if there's any doubt what date it is. 17 Want to see them all? I don't 18 think so. 19 Here's 10 of 32. Here's 20 another one. 21 Look at 10 of 32 -- or which 22 one do you have? Do you have 10 of 32? Do 23 you see that? 24 A. Yes, I see it. 25 MS. PUJARI: Can I have a copy,|Page 173 1 Q. Okay. Let's go back to 30 of 2 32, Exhibit 16. 3 From the same news article 4 where it says -- you see all this track work 5 being staged, all this stone piled up, track 6 panels out, that's Sunday, February 5th, the 7 day before the vent and burn. 8 Right? 9 A. Sunday, February 5th, is the 10 day before the vent and burn, yes. 11 Q. Right. 12 And it said in the incident 13 report for February 5th the decision had 14 already been made and the objective was to 15 get the track rebuilt. 16 Right? 17 MS. PUJARI: Objection. 18 Mischaracterizes the document and 19 prior testimony. 20 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 21 Q. That was the objective of the 22 status report on the 5th. 23 Want to look at it again? 24 Page 4 of 7 on Exhibit 14. 25 The objective was to reopen the|

1 line and resume traffic. That was the
2 objective, right?
3    A.   As written -4    Q.   Get that exhibit. It's
5 1621936. There you go. Page 4 of 7.
6        That's what's written right
7 there, right?
8    A.   That is what's written there.
9    Q.   All right. Let's see what
10 happens. So the cars, they were detonated at
11 4:37 p.m. on Monday night, Monday afternoon.
12 They burned all night.
13        And this is 19. Let's see what
14 happened. Let's see what happened.
15        (Dixon 30(b)(6) Exhibit 19
16    marked for identification.)
17 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:
18    Q.   Take a look at that. It's a
19 short e-mail message.
20        Sir, do you see that? It's
21 NS-CA-1384312.
22    A.   Yes, I'm looking at the
23 document.
24    Q.   Okay. And if we start at the
25 bottom, it's Wednesday, February 8th. Okay?


1    A.   That's what's on the document.
2    Q.   So the objective to get the
3 track reopened was met because of the vent
4 and burn.
5        Right?
6        MS. PUJARI: Objection.
7    Compound. Argumentative.
8        THE WITNESS: No, I don't
9    believe the objective itself was to
10    vent and burn to meet what was on, I
11    guess, your Exhibit 15.
12 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON:
13    Q.   Want us to put it back up?
14    A.   No, I read the -- what's
15 written on this sheet.
16    Q.   Right.
17    A.   I read the objective -18    Q.   "Objective: Timeline for
19 reopening line and resuming traffic," on
20 February 5th, before the vent and burn.
21        That was the objective, right?
22        That's what the document says.
23    A.   It says, "Timeline for
24 reopening line and resuming traffic."
25    Q.   Right.
|Page 175 1 The vent and burn was at 4:37 2 on Monday, the 6th. The cars burned all 3 night, and by 6:11 p.m., quote, "Main 2 is 4 clear, and our first train lined up to 5 traverse the derailment site." 6 Correct? 7 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Beyond 8 the scope of the 30(b)(6) topics. 9 What paragraph in the complaint 10 does this refer to? 11 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 12 Q. Answer the question, please. 13 You can preserve your 14 objection. 15 A. That's what's written on this 16 document. 17 Q. And then let's go up one more. 18 Update, February 8th, still 19 Wednesday at 7:26. "Update: Main 1 track 20 was cleared and back in service at 7:05 p.m." 21 Right? 22 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Beyond 23 the scope of the 30(b)(6) topics. 24 QUESTIONS BY MR. DENTON: 25 Q. That's what it says, right?|Page 177 1 A. That's exactly what it says. 2 MR. DENTON: I have no more 3 questions. 4 MS. BROZ: Can we go off the 5 record? 6 VIDEOGRAPHER: Stand by. 1:30, 7 we are off the video record. 8 (Off the record at 1:30 p.m.) 9 VIDEOGRAPHER: 1:39, we are on 10 the video record. 11 CROSS-EXAMINATION 12 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 13 Q. Good afternoon, Mr. Dixon. My 14 name is Alycia Broz, and I represent Oxy 15 Vinyls in this litigation. 16 Do you have all the deposition 17 exhibits in front of you that have been 18 handed to you to this day? 19 You do. Okay. 20 A. Yes. 21 Q. All right. Great. 22 Can you please turn your 23 attention to Exhibit 8? 24 MS. PUJARI: Counsel, before 25 you begin your questioning, I believe|
|---|---|


-----

1    we were going to substitute.
2        MS. BROZ: Sure.
3        MS. PUJARI: So we have agreed
4    to substitute for original Exhibit 3,
5    which was the Amended Notice of
6    Rule 30(B)(6) Videotaped Deposition of
7    Norfolk Southern Railway Company, with
8    the Second Amended Notice of the
9    Rule 36 -- Rule 30(b)(6) Videotaped
10    Deposition of Norfolk Southern Railway
11    Company.
12        So we will have a new
13    Exhibit 3. It will be the second
14    amended notice.
15        And counsel for Oxy Vinyls has
16    agreed that the questions from Oxy
17    Vinyls will be constrained to the
18    paragraphs identified in the second
19    amended notice. This is by agreement
20    because Oxy Vinyls did not serve its
21    own cross-notice of the 30(b)(6)
22    deposition.
23        So the paragraphs are going to
24    be limited to those on the second page
25    of the second amended 30(b)(6) notice


1    extent it calls for a legal
2    conclusion.
3        THE WITNESS: I'm not -- I'm
4    not sure I can properly answer that,
5    not knowing exactly what's within that
6    range.
7 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:
8    Q.   Okay. Let's turn to what
9 you -- we previously marked as Exhibit 1
10 then.
11    A.   Okay.
12    Q.   Did you rely on any other
13 documents, other than the documents that are
14 listed in Deposition Exhibit 1, in preparing
15 for your testimony today?
16    A.   The only thing, as I had stated
17 earlier today, is that I did reference the
18 operating rule books, Norfolk Southern's
19 operating rule books, and not Norfolk
20 Southern's NS-1.
21        Outside of that, these are the
22 documents.
23    Q.   If you turn your attention,
24 please, back to Deposition Exhibit 9, and I
25 want to turn to the second page of that
|Page 179 1 of deposition. 2 MS. BROZ: Thank you. 3 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 4 Q. Can you turn your attention, 5 please, to Exhibit 9? I know I said 8, but 6 we switched it between 8 and 9 in the 7 morning. So can you turn your attention to 8 Exhibit 9? I apologize. 9 A. That's fine. 10 Q. Are you there? 11 A. I am there. 12 Q. In the third paragraph of that 13 letter from counsel, it says that you are 14 producing documents in response to the 15 subpoena -- or the Rule 30(b)(6) deposition 16 notice that was served on you, Bates range 17 NS-CA-001617983 through NS-CA-01625358. 18 Do you see that? 19 A. I see that. 20 Q. Did you rely on any other 21 documents other than those identified in this 22 letter in preparing the third-party complaint 23 and the paragraphs listed in the deposition 24 notice? 25 MS. PUJARI: Objection to the|Page 181 1 document. 2 Do you see that paragraph where 3 it says, "As explained in Norfolk Southern's 4 e-mail"? 5 A. I see the paragraph. 6 Q. And it says you're "withholding 7 from production responsive documents based on 8 NTSB's directives from October 13, 2023." 9 Do you see that? 10 A. I see that. 11 Q. Can you describe for me the 12 types of documents that you are withholding 13 from your production based upon the NTSB's 14 directive that were responsive to this 15 Rule 30(b)(6) deposition notice? 16 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Calls 17 for a legal conclusion. 18 THE WITNESS: Yeah, I'm not 19 aware of any documents that have been 20 withheld. 21 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 22 Q. Okay. I apologize for bouncing 23 around. This is what happens when you go 24 second. 25 Can you please turn your|
|---|---|


-----

1 attention to what we've marked as Exhibit 4?
2        Are you there?
3    A.   I'm there.
4    Q.   Okay. Can you please turn your
5 attention, please, to paragraph 57 of that
6 document?
7        Are you at that paragraph?
8    A.   I am.
9    Q.   Okay. When did Norfolk
10 Southern first become aware that the five
11 vinyl chloride cars were stabilized using
12 oxygen purging?
13    A.   I can't speak to when Norfolk
14 Southern or anyone at Norfolk Southern first
15 became aware of it.
16    Q.   You're testifying today on
17 behalf of Norfolk Southern.
18        Correct?
19    A.   I am.
20    Q.   And this was one of the
21 paragraphs that you were asked to provide
22 testimony on.
23        Correct?
24    A.   It is.
25    Q.   And you don't know when Norfolk


1    I had stated.
2 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:
3    Q.   Was the fact that the vinyl
4 chloride cars were stabilized using oxygen
5 purging made aware -- let me start that
6 question again.
7        Was unified command notified
8 that the vinyl chloride cars were stabilized
9 using oxygen purging after the derailment on
10 February 3, 2023?
11        MS. PUJARI: Objection. Beyond
12    the scope of the 30(b)(6) topics.
13        THE WITNESS: Could you repeat
14    the question?
15        MS. BROZ: Can you read that
16    back, please? Thank you.
17        (Court Reporter read back
18    question.)
19        MS. PUJARI: Objection. Beyond
20    the scope of the 30(b)(6) topics.
21        THE WITNESS: Yeah, I'm not -22    I'm not aware when unified command was
23    notified.
24 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:
25    Q.   Does Norfolk Southern have any
|Page 183 1 Southern first became aware of this 2 allegation? 3 A. I can tell you that I read -- I 4 read this in the documents that we were -- 5 that I reviewed, that Oxy Vinyls uses 6 oxygen -- or utilized oxygen purging to 7 stabilize its vinyl chloride. 8 Q. But you're unable to tell me 9 today when Norfolk Southern first became 10 aware of this allegation? 11 A. I would assume -- 12 Q. I don't want you to assume. I 13 want you to answer my question. 14 When did Norfolk Southern first 15 become aware of this allegation? 16 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Asked 17 and answered. 18 THE WITNESS: Yeah, I'm not 19 aware. 20 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 21 Q. Who from Norfolk Southern was 22 aware of this allegation? 23 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Calls 24 for speculation. 25 THE WITNESS: I'm not aware, as|Page 185 1 evidence that the vinyl chloride in the five 2 railcars was not properly stabilized? 3 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Vague 4 as to time. 5 THE WITNESS: Please repeat the 6 question. 7 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 8 Q. Sure. 9 As of today, sitting here, does 10 Norfolk Southern have any evidence that the 11 vinyl chloride in the five railcars was not 12 properly stabilized? 13 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Vague 14 as to time. 15 THE WITNESS: I don't -- I 16 don't know of any information that 17 tells us that, other than the vinyl 18 chloride was stabilized at the 19 point -- upon the point -- or the 20 point of us transporting those 21 railcars. 22 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 23 Q. What was the point of you 24 transporting the railcars? 25 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Vague.|
|---|---|


-----

1        THE WITNESS: We were providing
2    a service for a shipper.
3 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:
4    Q.   Okay. Your testimony reads
5 that you don't have any information that the
6 vinyl chloride was stabilized at the point of
7 transporting the railcars.
8        So I'm trying to understand
9 what you're trying to say -10    A.   No, I said -- I was stating
11 that other than having information that tells
12 us that the vinyl chloride -- that they came
13 on with their safety data sheets, and the
14 information in the bill of lading tells us
15 this is vinyl chloride.
16    Q.   Did it also tell you it was
17 vinyl chloride stabilized?
18    A.   All of our -- all of our
19 emergency response guides indicate vinyl
20 chloride stabilized as a product we haul.
21    Q.   And was that the product that
22 was being hauled on February 3, 2023, as part
23 of rail line 32N?
24    A.   Yes, it was vinyl chloride.
25    Q.   Vinyl chloride stabilized,


1 papers that indicated it was vinyl chloride
2 properly stabilized at that point.
3    Q.   In several paragraphs of the
4 third-party complaint, you reference several
5 treatises or manuals or handbooks that speak
6 to the properties of vinyl chloride.
7        Correct?
8        MS. PUJARI: Counsel, could you
9    orient us to the paragraphs you're
10    referring to?
11        MS. BROZ: Sure. 60, 64, 65,
12    66, 67, 134, 69, 70 and 71.
13        MS. PUJARI: Thank you.
14        THE WITNESS: Yes, we had a
15    number -- a number of manuals or
16    regulations that pertain to it.
17 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:
18    Q.   And I believe those manuals or
19 regulations include Pamphlet 171, correct?
20    A.   It does.
21    Q.   Sittig's Handbook?
22    A.   Can you state exactly which
23 document you're referring to?
24    Q.   Paragraph 60 of the complaint,
25 Sittig's Handbook. I don't know if I'm
|Page 187 1 correct? 2 A. Stabilized, yes. 3 Q. And do you have any evidence 4 whatsoever, as a representative of Norfolk 5 Southern, that the vinyl chloride was not 6 properly stabilized? 7 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Vague 8 as to time. 9 THE WITNESS: What I don't have 10 any concrete information on is whether 11 the vinyl chloride was stabilized 12 following the derailment. 13 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 14 Q. But as of the time of loading 15 it into the cars, it was stabilized properly. 16 Correct? 17 A. I assume it -- that's -- that 18 is something that I can't speak on behalf of 19 NS because I'm not sure when it was loaded, 20 at what point it was loaded. I know we 21 received it at TRRA in St. Louis. 22 Q. When you received it in TRRA in 23 St. Louis, it was properly stabilized, 24 correct? 25 A. Again, we were given shipping|Page 189 1 pronouncing it correctly. 2 A. Sittig's Handbook, yes. 3 Q. Oxy Vinyls vinyl chloride SDS? 4 A. Yes. 5 Q. Norfolk Southern emergency 6 safety guide for vinyl chloride? 7 A. Yes. 8 Q. US Department of 9 Transportation's emergency response 10 guidebook? 11 A. Yes. 12 Q. Of those five manuals -- we'll 13 call them manuals just for the sake of 14 reference. Of those five manuals we just 15 discussed, which of those did Norfolk 16 Southern rely upon in East Palestine after 17 the train derailment on April -- on 18 February 3, 2023? 19 A. I think Norfolk Southern 20 representatives there on the ground in East 21 Palestine relied on their knowledge of all of 22 those documents. Primarily, again, at the 23 initial incident, probably the safety data 24 sheet and the emergency response guide. 25 Q. Did Norfolk Southern rely upon|
|---|---|


-----

1 or review Pamphlet 171 when making the
2 decision to vent and burn the railcars on
3 February 6, 2023?
4    A.   I can't speak to that, having
5 not been part of that team.
6    Q.   And you are Norfolk Southern's
7 representative today, correct?
8    A.   Yes.
9    Q.   And that is an allegation that
10 is made in paragraph 60 of the third amended
11 complaint that you were asked to testify
12 about, correct?
13        MS. PUJARI: Objection.
14    Misstates the complaint.
15        THE WITNESS: Yeah, we're -16    we're -- the reference here to The
17    Chlorine Institute and Vinyl Institute
18    Pamphlet 171 is in combination to,
19    again, paragraph 60, which is
20    referencing the possibility of
21    polymerization.
22 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:
23    Q.   Did Norfolk Southern rely upon
24 the information in Pamphlet 161 -- 171
25 between February 3rd and February 6, 2023,


1    Q.   Did the incident team refer
2 or -- refer or rely on Pamphlet 161 {sic}
3 when it made its decision to vent and burn
4 the five railcars? It's a simple question.
5        MS. PUJARI: Objection. Asked
6    and answered.
7        THE WITNESS: It may be a
8    simple question, but, again, it's
9    information as a whole. That's why we
10    have specialists that go in and work
11    locally with local responders. That's
12    why there's training on hazardous
13    material, to get as much information
14    as they can through their experience
15    and their knowledge.
16        So did -- was the vinyl
17    chloride -- or The Chloride Institute
18    and Vinyl Institute's Pamphlet 171 the
19    only thing that was utilized to make a
20    determination? Then I would say it
21    was not the only document.
22 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:
23    Q.   Are you saying that they did
24 utilize it, though, in making the
25 determination?
|Page 191 1 when it made the decision to vent and burn 2 the five railcars? 3 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Asked 4 and answered. 5 THE WITNESS: Yeah, I don't 6 think, number one, the decision was 7 Norfolk Southern's to make, the 8 decision to vent and burn. 9 I think the incident commander 10 and the incident team made the 11 decision based on guidance from all 12 team members. 13 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 14 Q. Did the incident commander and 15 the incident team rely upon Pamphlet 171 when 16 it made the decision to vent and burn the 17 five railcars? 18 A. I think the incident team 19 utilized their knowledge, at least the 20 individuals familiar with HAZMAT utilized 21 their -- which is the team, used their 22 knowledge contained in both the Chlorine 23 Institute and Vinyl Institute, the ERG, the 24 safety data sheet as well as Norfolk 25 Southern's sheets with respect to chemicals.|Page 193 1 A. I'm telling you that I -- we 2 believe the information and the knowledge 3 presented within The Chlorine Institute and 4 Vinyl Institute Pamphlet 171 was information 5 that was known to responders and participants 6 on the team. 7 Q. Which responders was it known 8 to? 9 A. It would have been known to any 10 of our -- a number of our hazardous materials 11 specialists, the SPSI, the two contractors. 12 Norfolk Southern was more than likely 13 familiar with that. Again, our own Norfolk 14 Southern HAZMAT employees would be familiar 15 with the document. 16 Q. I understand they are familiar 17 with it, they may have read it at some point, 18 but did they rely on the information in the 19 document when they made the decision to vent 20 and burn the five railcars on February 6, 21 2023? 22 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Asked 23 and answered. 24 THE WITNESS: Again -- 25 MS. PUJARI: Several times now.|
|---|---|


-----

1        THE WITNESS: Again, I do not
2    believe that any one of these
3    documents was the -- was a thing that
4    was solely relied upon.
5 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:
6    Q.   I'm not asking if it was any
7 one.
8        I'm asking if it is one of the
9 documents they relied upon.
10        MS. PUJARI: Objection. Asked
11    and answered.
12        THE WITNESS: And again, I
13    think the knowledge in those documents
14    was utilized in making a
15    determination, assessing the situation
16    and looking at all the possibilities.
17 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:
18    Q.   How about for Sittig's
19 Handbook? Same answer?
20    A.   Yes.
21    Q.   Let's turn to paragraph 161 of
22 the third amended complaint.
23        MS. PUJARI: Third complaint.
24        MS. BROZ: What's that?
25        MS. PUJARI: Third-party


1 other basis to claim that polymerization can
2 accelerate the risk of BLEVE by blocking
3 pressure relief devices other than the NTSB
4 Hazardous Materials Group Chair Factual
5 Report?
6    A.   I'm not aware of any other
7 documents with respect to polymerization and
8 blocking pressure release surface devices
9 outside of the NTSB docket report and perhaps
10 the testimony in the hearings, the NTSB
11 hearings.
12    Q.   Let's go to paragraph 62. It
13 says, "Though Oxy Vinyls is now discounting
14 the risk that stabilized vinyl chloride can
15 polymerize due to heating alone, the chemical
16 data sheet that Oxy Vinyls provided to
17 Norfolk Southern warns of the polymerization
18 and explosion risk of vinyl chloride due to
19 excess heating."
20        Did I read that correctly?
21    A.   Yes, that's what's written.
22    Q.   Okay. What chemical data sheet
23 are you referring to in paragraph 62?
24    A.   Oxy Vinyls' safety data sheet
25 that was provided.
|Page 195 1 complaint, right? 2 MS. BROZ: Yep. 3 MS. PUJARI: Okay. 4 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 5 Q. Let me try that again. Let's 6 turn to paragraph 61 of the third-party 7 complaint. 8 MR. DENTON: 61? 9 MS. BROZ: 61. 10 MS. PUJARI: Okay. You got it? 11 THE WITNESS: Uh-huh. 12 MS. PUJARI: 61. 13 THE WITNESS: Yeah, this is... 14 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 15 Q. What is the basis for the 16 statement in paragraph 61 that polymerization 17 can accelerate the risks BLEVE by blocking 18 pressure release devices? 19 A. I think I would need to review 20 the NTSB docket B, Exhibit 10, Hazardous 21 Materials Group Chair's Factual Report. 22 MS. PUJARI: I believe that's 23 been marked. 24 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 25 Q. Does Norfolk Southern have any|Page 197 1 Q. Who from Norfolk Southern 2 reviewed Oxy Vinyls' safety data sheet? 3 A. I don't know who, or everyone 4 at Norfolk Southern, that's reviewed Oxy 5 Vinyls' safety data sheet with respect to 6 vinyl chloride. 7 Q. Do you know who was on the 8 ground on February 3, 2023, that reviewed Oxy 9 Vinyls' safety data sheet? 10 A. No, I cannot attest to everyone 11 that had read the safety data sheet. 12 However, in any incident, that 13 is one of the very first things the 14 responders would pull, is the safety data 15 sheet. And corresponding to the lading of 16 the shipment. 17 Q. Can you attest to who from 18 Norfolk Southern reviewed the safety data 19 sheet? 20 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Asked 21 and answered. 22 THE WITNESS: Again, I can't 23 attest who all at Norfolk Southern had 24 read the safety data sheet. 25|

1 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:
2    Q.   What is the basis for your
3 allegation that Oxy Vinyls is now discounting
4 the risk that stabilized vinyl chloride can
5 polymerize?
6    A.   I think if you look at the
7 Hazardous Materials Group Chair Factual
8 Report and the NTSB investigative hearing
9 transcript, day 2 and day 1, there's -10 there's mention -- mention of Oxy Vinyls
11 discounting the risk that stabilized vinyl
12 chloride can polymerize due to heating alone.
13    Q.   Any other basis for that
14 statement?
15    A.   No. I think it's, again, a
16 combination of looking at the -- Oxy's vinyl
17 chloride safety data sheet and, again, along
18 with the Hazardous Materials Group Chair
19 Factual Report and the investigative hearing
20 transcripts, day 1, day 2.
21    Q.   Before February -- between
22 February 3rd and February 6, 2023, did any
23 Oxy Vinyls representative tell Norfolk
24 Southern that stabilized vinyl chloride
25 cannot polymerize by heating it alone?


1        Correct?
2        MS. PUJARI: Objection.
3    Mischaracterizes the evidence, and
4    vague as to time.
5        THE WITNESS: There was a
6    statement from Oxy Vinyl, again, not
7    being able to determine or rule out
8    the possibility of polymerization.
9    There were statements also from other
10    representatives at Oxy Vinyl stating
11    that there was not a possibility.
12        But the safety data sheet that
13    Oxy Vinyl provided actually gave
14    concern that regardless of people not
15    on the ground -- if looking at the
16    safety data sheet alone, there's still
17    a possibility, regardless of what's
18    being relayed by different individuals
19    at Oxy, that polymerization could
20    occur.
21 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:
22    Q.   Why did you discount the
23 realtime advice provided by Oxy and instead
24 rely upon the safety data sheet?
25        MS. PUJARI: Objection.
|Page 199 1 A. I believe there was a 2 representative from vinyl oxy -- vinyl -- or, 3 I'm sorry, for Oxy Vinyls that had made that 4 statement. 5 Q. Between February 3rd and 6 February 6, 2023, did anyone from Oxy Vinyls 7 tell Norfolk Southern that stabilized vinyl 8 chloride can polymerize due to heating alone? 9 A. No, I don't believe that 10 anybody made that statement. However, there 11 was a possibility by the Oxy rep, the field 12 representative on the ground, that -- where 13 he stated that he couldn't discount the 14 possibility of polymerization. 15 Q. And what date was that 16 statement made? 17 A. It was early in the response, 18 and I'd have to go back and look at the 19 transcripts. 20 Q. And as time passed, was that 21 statement ever made again? 22 A. I'm not aware of that statement 23 being made again. 24 Q. In fact, the opposite was said 25 after the initial statement was made.|Page 201 1 Mischaracterizes prior testimony. 2 THE WITNESS: I can't attest to 3 why or what -- somebody ruled 4 something completely out. 5 I can tell you that individuals 6 looking at the safety data sheets, 7 looking at the situation on the 8 ground, again, looking at the -- you 9 know, their knowledge of vinyl 10 chloride, that there were other things 11 on the ground outside of 12 polymerization that they were looking 13 at. 14 With respect to polymerization, 15 again, the safety data sheet says 16 vinyl chloride stabilized. However, 17 throughout the safety data sheet, 18 there are sections in there 19 corresponding to firefighting, 20 which -- corresponding to dangers and 21 hazards throughout -- storage, for 22 example. Throughout the entire safety 23 data sheet, it states, do not expose 24 to heat, extremely flammable, can 25 violently pol -- I don't want to get|
|---|---|


-----

1    the name messed up. Polymerization
2    can occur.
3        That is why, when somebody is
4    looking at that safety data sheet,
5    they're assuming this is something
6    we've got to be concerned with. These
7    cars are in pool fires. They're being
8    heated.
9        If Oxy Vinyls is saying that
10    you can't -- there can't be any
11    potential for polymerization, then the
12    safety data sheet, again, as far as
13    storage, it says for vinyl chloride
14    store in a cool, dry place.
15        And underneath it it says
16    within -- on the safety data sheet
17    that if it's not stored correctly, it
18    can polymerize.
19        And that follows right after,
20    if not stabilized and/or stored
21    correctly.
22 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:
23    Q.   Now, could you answer my
24 question?
25        Why did Norfolk Southern


1    include the SDS, which is the very
2    first thing all the responders, I
3    think, look towards, that and the
4    emergency response guide, to make
5    their decisions.
6 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:
7    Q.   Let's turn to paragraph 64,
8 which discusses the SDS.
9        Did anyone from Norfolk
10 Southern ask vinyl -- Oxy -- let me try it
11 again.
12        Did anyone from Norfolk
13 Southern ask anyone from Oxy Vinyls about the
14 information contained in the SDS?
15    A.   I'm not -- I'm not aware of any
16 conversations, again, outside of the -17 again, if we're talking about a time frame of
18 between the derailment -- that occurred
19 following the derailment -20    Q.   Between February -- we can
21 clarify the time frame, if you'd like.
22        Between February 3rd and
23 February 6, 2023, did anyone from Norfolk
24 Southern ask Oxy Vinyls about the information
25 that was contained in the vinyl chloride SDS?
|Page 203 1 discount the real-time advice provided by Oxy 2 Vinyls and instead rely upon the SDS? 3 MS. PUJARI: Objection. 4 Misstates prior testimony, facts in 5 evidence. Asked and answered. 6 THE WITNESS: Yeah, it's the 7 same -- the same response I just got. 8 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 9 Q. Would you please answer my 10 question? 11 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Asked 12 and answered. 13 THE WITNESS: Repeat the 14 question. 15 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 16 Q. Why did Norfolk Southern 17 discount the real-time advice provided by Oxy 18 Vinyls and instead rely upon the SDS? 19 MS. PUJARI: Objection. 20 Misstates prior testimony. Asked and 21 answered. 22 THE WITNESS: Again, I don't 23 think anything was discounted. I 24 think they were looking at all the 25 information they had at hand to|Page 205 1 A. I can't attest to any 2 communications on the ground, but, again, Oxy 3 Vinyl had a representative there on the 4 ground in East Palestine communicating with 5 the incident response team. 6 MS. BROZ: Can we go off the 7 record a second? 8 VIDEOGRAPHER: Stand by. 2:13, 9 we are off the video record. 10 (Off the record at 2:13 p.m.) 11 VIDEOGRAPHER: 2:13, we are on 12 the video record. 13 (Dixon 30(b)(6) Exhibit 20 14 marked for identification.) 15 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 16 Q. Mr. Dixon, we have just handed 17 you what's been marked as Deposition 18 Exhibit 20. 19 Can you identify this document 20 for me? 21 A. This is Oxy Vinyls' safety data 22 sheet for vinyl chloride monomer. 23 Q. Can you turn to Section 10 of 24 this, please? 25 A. Yes.|
|---|---|


-----

1    Q.   Are you at Section 10?
2    A.   I am.
3    Q.   Where it says "Stability and
4 Reactivity"?
5    A.   Yes.
6    Q.   Do you see where it says
7 "Chemical Stability"?
8    A.   I do.
9    Q.   And it says, "Generally stable
10 at normal temperatures and pressures;
11 however, may violently polymerize or generate
12 other hazardous conditions when not
13 stabilized and/or stored correctly."
14        Do you see that?
15    A.   I do.
16    Q.   Did Norfolk Southern take this
17 statement into account when it was
18 determining whether or not the vinyl chloride
19 was polymerizing?
20    A.   I believe they did.
21    Q.   And it says, "Will not
22 polymerize when it's stabilized."
23        Correct?
24    A.   It says, "When not stabilized
25 and/or stored correctly."


1    A.   I believe that's the date, yes.
2    Q.   And all of the documents that
3 you just referenced as being the source for
4 this emergency safety guide were published
5 after 2006.
6        Correct?
7    A.   I don't know the response to
8 that off the hand. I'd have to look at each
9 one independently.
10        I can tell you the emergency
11 response guide was definitely last updated in
12 2020. I can't speak to the others as far as
13 the dates.
14    Q.   So at the time of the East
15 Palestine derailment, were you relying upon
16 the 2006 guide or the 2020 guide when making
17 the decisions of whether to vent and burn the
18 vinyl chloride cars?
19    A.   Again, the guides themselves
20 are not just taken once -- one over another.
21 They're looking at all of the information at
22 hand to make a determination.
23        So Norfolk Southern's emergency
24 safety guide would not have been the
25 driving -- let's say, driving force of all
|Page 207 1 Q. And I believe you testified 2 earlier today that the tank cars were not 3 breached upon the derailment. 4 Correct? 5 A. I believe that -- that's what 6 I stated earlier, yes. 7 Q. Let's turn to -- again, 8 apologize for jumping around here -- 9 paragraph 69 of the complaint. 10 You see in paragraph 69 it 11 references the emergency safety guide? 12 A. Yes. 13 Q. What is the source of the 14 information that is contained in Norfolk 15 Southern's emergency safety guide? 16 A. It is a -- information similar 17 to what's captured in both the vinyl chloride 18 pamphlet that we had referenced before. A 19 lot of the similar information from the 20 safety data sheet, similar to information 21 captured on the emergency response guide from 22 the DOT and PHMSA. 23 Q. And Norfolk Southern's 24 emergency safety guide was published in 25 September of 2006, correct?|Page 209 1 the documents to make a decision as far as 2 the handling. 3 Q. I understand you're 4 anticipating my questions, but I want you to 5 answer the question I asked. 6 Did you rely upon the 2006 7 guide or the 2020 guide when making the 8 decision to vent and burn the vinyl chloride 9 cars? 10 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Asked 11 and answered. 12 THE WITNESS: Again, I'm not 13 claiming that we relied solely on this 14 guide to make a decision, whether it's 15 the 2020 or not. 16 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 17 Q. I'm not saying solely. Which 18 one did you rely upon, the 2006 guide or the 19 2020 guide? 20 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Asked 21 and answered. 22 THE WITNESS: Incident command 23 and the incident responders would have 24 been looking at the 2020 emergency 25 response guide. They would have been|
|---|---|


-----

1    looking at the safety data sheet.
2    They would have been looking at any
3    other information that was provided at
4    that time on vinyl chloride.
5 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:
6    Q.   You just testified that Norfolk
7 Southern would have been looking at other
8 information that was provided at the time
9 about vinyl chloride.
10        Correct?
11    A.   They would have been looking at
12 all the information they had at hand to
13 determine what's the best actions to take
14 here. What are we dealing with to determine
15 what are the risks and the exposures
16 associated with vinyl chloride.
17    Q.   But that did not include the
18 directives from Oxy Vinyls about whether the
19 vinyl chloride was polymerizing.
20        Correct?
21        MS. PUJARI: Objection.
22    Mischaracterizes prior testimony.
23        THE WITNESS: As I had stated
24    before, I don't think any of the
25    guidance that was provided or any of


1 within the railcars that were unknown. Those
2 were a few.
3    Q.   What were the others?
4    A.   Again, I wasn't a part of the
5 incident command, and I don't have all the
6 information pertaining to what was
7 considered. But those were two.
8    Q.   The potential of polymerization
9 and the pressure within the railcars,
10 correct?
11    A.   And again, the fires
12 associated -- associated with them, the heat.
13 The fact that I don't believe anybody would
14 argue that these cars were not stored
15 properly.
16    Q.   So we have polymerization,
17 pressure, fires and heat.
18        What were the other risks?
19    A.   Chemicals that had been
20 released. I mean, if you're talking about
21 what are the other risks, can you clarify?
22        Are you referring to risks
23 associated to...
24    Q.   What factors did Norfolk
25 Southern take into account when deciding to
|Page 211 1 the information that was provided was 2 just discounted. 3 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 4 Q. But you did vent and burn the 5 five railcars containing vinyl chloride, 6 despite Oxy Vinyls' recommendation. 7 Correct? 8 MS. PUJARI: Objection. 9 Misstates the evidence. 10 THE WITNESS: The decision -- 11 the decision was not based solely, to 12 start with, on polymerization. The 13 decision took -- 14 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 15 Q. What was it based on? 16 MS. PUJARI: Could you let the 17 witness finish? 18 THE WITNESS: The consideration 19 was taking into account all risks 20 associated at the derailment site at 21 that time, polymerization being one, 22 potential polymerization being one. 23 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 24 Q. What were the other risks? 25 A. The pressure -- the pressures|Page 213 1 vent and burn the five cars containing vinyl 2 chloride? 3 A. They were looking, again, at 4 what is the safest course of action here; 5 looking at the possibility that we had cars 6 with unknown pressures; didn't have a lot of 7 comfort in temperatures at those -- at that 8 point; knowing that we have, again, 9 conflicting statements throughout the time on 10 polymerization; knowing the safety data sheet 11 says, look, stabilized vinyl chloride will 12 not pol -- there's not a risk there with 13 polymerization; however, it also states if 14 not properly stored, it can polymerize. 15 There was a lot of factors that 16 everyone as part of that response team was 17 looking at to make a determination as to what 18 do we do in order to mitigate the risks. 19 What's the best course of action. 20 Q. And you said the pressures were 21 not known in the railcars. 22 Is that correct? 23 A. My understanding, there was a 24 point where they were trying to get 25 measurements of the pressures of the|
|---|---|


-----

1 railcars. And due to the fact that a lot of
2 the pressure relief valve -- valves -- I
3 mean, pressure release devices and valves
4 were damaged and the pressure relief
5 valves -- or pressure relief devices were no
6 longer activating, that there really wasn't
7 an easy way at that point in time to gauge
8 the pressure within the tanks.
9    Q.   Can you turn back to what we
10 previously marked as Exhibit 13?
11        MS. BROZ: Can we go off the
12    record a second?
13        MR. DENTON: Sure.
14        VIDEOGRAPHER: Stand by. 2:24,
15    we are off the video record.
16     (Off the record at 2:24 p.m.)
17        VIDEOGRAPHER: 2:33, we are on
18    the video record.
19 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:
20    Q.   Mr. Dixon, could you please
21 turn to page 80 of 158 of Deposition
22 Exhibit 13?
23    A.   Okay.
24    Q.   Let's go to the fifth
25 paragraph. It starts with "At that point."


1        (Dixon 30(b)(6) Exhibits 21 and
2    22 marked for identification.)
3 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:
4    Q.   Do you have in front of you
5 what we marked as Deposition Exhibit 21?
6    A.   Yes, I do.
7    Q.   For the record, it's
8 N S - C A - 0 0 1 6 2 0 2 1 1 .
9        Because we're short on time,
10 will you agree with me that these are the
11 temperature readings for the five vinyl
12 chloride tank cars that were taken by Norfolk
13 Southern or its contractors between
14 February 3rd and February 6, 2023?
15        MS. PUJARI: Objection. Lack
16    of foundation.
17        THE WITNESS: Yeah, I know I've
18    seen temperature readings.  They don't
19    appear that off from what I'm seeing
20    here, but, again, I can't attest that
21    these are the exact measurements
22    without looking at other documents
23    that were submitted.
24 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:
25    Q.   What was the highest
|Page 215 1 A. Okay. 2 Q. Do you see that? 3 A. Yes. 4 Q. It says that, "SPSI responders 5 made first entry with pressure gauges to 6 check the condition of the VCM tank cars." 7 Correct? 8 A. Yes. 9 Q. And "Crews were able to access 10 one of the angle valves on the eastern-most 11 VCM tank car, 28, TILX402025, to test tank 12 pressures - the SPI president recalled that 13 it was not remarkable." 14 Correct? 15 A. Correct. 16 Q. So at least in one of the tank 17 cars, pressure was not an issue; is that 18 correct? 19 A. At that point in time, I would 20 say that's correct. 21 Q. And you also said that one of 22 the other factors that led to the decision to 23 vent and burn was the temperatures. 24 Correct? 25 A. Correct.|Page 217 1 temperature reading on any of the five tank 2 cars according to Deposition Exhibit 21? 3 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Vague 4 as to time. 5 THE WITNESS: I think I saw 127 6 from this list in these pictures. 7 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 8 Q. And for tank cars 26, 27, 28 9 and 29, which would be tank cars 1, 2, 3 and 10 4 on Deposition Exhibit 21? 11 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Lack 12 of foundation. Vague as to time. 13 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 14 Q. What was the highest 15 temperature reading ever taken? 16 A. From these pictures, it appears 17 6 5 . 18 Q. Did any of the temperature 19 readings for any of the tank cars go up 20 during the course of the temperature readings 21 between February 3rd and February 6, 2023? 22 A. I believe the answer is -- to 23 my recollection is, yes, there was a 24 temperature that went up. 25 Q. Okay. Which one?|
|---|---|


-----

1    A.   I'm going to have to look at -2 I think it was provided in the documents
3 showing all the temperatures gauges in the
4 graph associated with -5    Q.   Okay. Why don't we go ahead
6 and mark that.
7        MS. PUJARI: Wasn't it marked
8    already 22?
9        MS. BROZ: Yes, Exhibit 22.
10 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:
11    Q.   Can you look at Exhibit 22 and
12 let me know if that's what you're thinking
13 of?
14    A.   Yes, this is what I was
15 thinking of.
16    Q.   Okay. So this is from tank car
17 OCPX80370.
18        Correct?
19    A.   Yes. Correct.
20    Q.   And you're referring to the
21 spike where the temperature went up to
22 138 degrees.
23        Correct?
24    A.   Yeah. Not only that spike, but
25 the rise to 130, the increase. I mean, there


1 based off this graph that -- and the answer
2 is, yes, that it decreased by that amount.
3    Q.   And does the NAB temperature
4 readings in Deposition Exhibit 21 contradict
5 the graph?
6    A.   I'm not quite sure what car -7 this is car OCPX80370, which is Car 53.
8    Q.   It appears to be car -9        MS. PUJARI: Objection. Lack
10    of foundation.
11        THE WITNESS: If that's Car 53,
12    then it appears to match what's on the
13    chart provided.
14 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:
15    Q.   I have five minutes left, so
16 let's quickly turn back to Deposition
17 Exhibit 13.
18        Let's go to page 28 of 158.
19        Paragraph begins with "On
20 March 20, 2023."
21    A.   I'm sorry, I don't see that.
22    Q.   Page 28 of 158.
23    A.   28. I'm sorry.
24        Okay.
25    Q.   The paragraph that starts with
|Page 219 1 was -- there were changes, I guess, 2 throughout in the temperature. 3 Q. After that spike at 4 138 degrees, the temperature in OCPX80370 5 went down, correct? 6 MS. PUJARI: Objection. 7 Misstates the evidence. 8 THE WITNESS: It looks like 9 there was a change in temperature 10 between 1 a.m. and around 9 a.m., a 11 drop, not as significantly -- not as 12 significant as the drop between -- in 13 the evening between 6 and 8, I guess. 14 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 15 Q. And from the peak of 16 138 degrees till the temperature -- wait, 17 just start that again. 18 From the peak of 138 degrees 19 till the time of the vent and burn, the 20 temperature decreased by 12 degrees 21 Fahrenheit. 22 Correct? 23 A. That's correct. 24 Based on this -- I do want to 25 qualify that statement, though. It's just|Page 221 1 "On March 20th"? 2 A. I see that. 3 Q. Do you see the second sentence 4 says, "The Oxy Vinyls technical manager at 5 its La Porte, Texas facility told NTSB 6 investigators that based upon the analyses, 7 it concluded that no PVC was present in any 8 of the railcar samples"? 9 A. I see that that's written here, 10 yes. 11 Q. Let's now go to page 63 of 158. 12 You see this refers to Car 29, 13 OCPX80235? 14 A. Yes, I see that. 15 Q. You see the last sentence on 16 the page is, "There is no evidence of polymer 17 or other contaminants within the spring guide 18 tube or other components"? 19 A. I see where that's written, 20 yes. 21 Q. Okay. Let's go to page 65 of 22 158. And we'll go to the last para -- 23 paragraph on the page, Car 30, OCPX80179. 24 Second to last sentence on the 25 page, "Other than a thick layer of the|

1 soot/carbon coating, the PRD teardown found
2 no evidence of polymer or other contaminants
3 within the spring guide tube or other
4 components."
5        Did I read that correctly?
6    A.   That's what is written here.
7    Q.   Let's go to page 68 of 158.
8        You see this refers to Car 31,
9 GATX95098?
10        And the sentence above the
11 picture says, "Other than the soot/carbon
12 coating, the PRD teardown found no evidence
13 of polymer or other contaminants within the
14 spring guide tube or other components."
15        Correct?
16    A.   That's what's written here.
17    Q.   Let's go to page 71 of 158.
18 And this refers to Car 55, OCPX80370.
19        And the first sentence on that
20 page says, "Other than a thick layer of
21 soot/carbon within the PRD spring guide tube,
22 the PRD teardown found no evidence of polymer
23 or other contaminants within the components."
24        Do you see that?
25    A.   I see that's written here, yes.


1        MS. PUJARI: Objection. Asked
2    and answered. Calls for expert
3    testimony.
4        THE WITNESS: Yeah, again, I'm
5    not an expert on the material;
6    however, again, I haven't seen any
7    information at this point.
8        MS. BROZ: I'll stop there.
9        I have one minute?
10        VIDEOGRAPHER: One minute.
11        2:47, we are off the video
12    record.
13     (Off the record at 2:47 p.m.)
14        VIDEOGRAPHER: 2:50, we are on
15    the video record.
16        CROSS-EXAMINATION
17 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS:
18    Q.   Good afternoon, Mr. Dixon. My
19 name is Carrie Karis, and I represent GATX
20 and General American Marks Company.
21        You've been appearing here
22 today as a representative of Norfolk
23 S o u t h e r n .
24        You understand that, correct?
25    A.   I do understand that.
|Page 223 1 Q. Does Norfolk Southern have any 2 evidence that polymer was found on any of the 3 vinyl chloride railcars? 4 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Calls 5 for -- 6 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 7 Q. That were involved in the 8 derailment? Sorry. 9 MS. PUJARI: Sorry. 10 Objection. Calls for expert 11 testimony. 12 THE WITNESS: I have not seen 13 any detailed information pertaining to 14 any polymer, with the exception of 15 during the vent and burn, there was 16 some release, I guess, with the gases 17 that appeared to be white. But again, 18 I think -- I don't believe that 19 everything's been finalized with 20 respect to the investigation. 21 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ: 22 Q. So Norfolk Southern has no 23 evidence that polymer was found on any of the 24 vinyl chloride railcars at this time, 25 correct?|Page 225 1 Q. And you understand that you're 2 not speaking on behalf of yourself; you're 3 speaking on behalf of the company. 4 Correct? 5 A. I understand that. 6 Q. Okay. Now, today when I talk 7 about GATX and General American Marks 8 Company, is it okay if I refer to them 9 collectively as GATX? 10 A. Yes. 11 Q. Okay. So when I ask you 12 questions and I say "GATX," just keep in mind 13 I'm talking about both of them. 14 Okay? Fair enough? 15 A. Okay. 16 Q. All right. Now, you've been 17 talking this afternoon and the latter part of 18 this morning about the decision to vent and 19 b u r n . 20 C o r r e c t ? 21 A. I've been asked about questions 22 concerning vent and burn. 23 Q. Right. 24 And you've been answering 25 questions about vent and burn.|
|---|---|


-----

1        C o r r e c t ?
2    A.   Correct.
3    Q.   And Norfolk Southern agrees
4 that my clients, GATX, had nothing to do with
5 the decision to vent and burn.
6        Is that correct?
7    A.   That's correct.
8    Q.   GATX provided no input into
9 whether polymerization was occurring.
10        C o r r e c t ?
11    A.   That's correct.
12    Q.   And GATX did not provide
13 Norfolk Southern or anybody in unified
14 command any material safety data sheets.
15        Correct?
16        MS. PUJARI: Objection.
17    Assumes facts not in evidence.
18 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS:
19    Q.   You can answer.
20    A.   Can you repeat the question,
21 please?
22    Q.   Sure.
23        GATX did not provide anybody at
24 Norfolk Southern with any information
25 concerning material safety data sheets.


1 understand.
2        Exhibit 1, which was marked
3 this morning, has the topics, and then there
4 are a number of documents that you claim you
5 reviewed in order to prepare to testify about
6 each of those documents.
7        Correct?
8    A.   That's correct.
9    Q.   And I've gone through this, and
10 I want you to correct me if I'm wrong, but I
11 think in all of these documents that are on
12 here, there's only a single Norfolk Southern
13 document that you reviewed in order to
14 testify here today.
15        Is that accurate?
16    A.   No, that's not accurate. As I
17 stated earlier, I did look at Norfolk
18 Southern's operating rules, and I did look at
19 Norfolk Southern's NS-1 rules with respect to
20 equipment handling.
21    Q.   Okay. Fair enough.
22        With the exception of those
23 three documents or groups of documents, the
24 annual report, the Norfolk Southern operating
25 rules and Norfolk Southern NS-1 rules, you
|Page 227 1 C o r r e c t ? 2 A. I understand that to be 3 c o r r e c t . 4 Q. Okay. And as far as you know, 5 GATX didn't provide any input to unified 6 command as to how to handle any aspect of the 7 d e r a i lm e n t . 8 C o r r e c t ? 9 A. I believe that's correct. 10 Q. Okay. Now, I want to focus on 11 things that Norfolk Southern claims my client 12 did have involvement in. 13 Fair enough? 14 A. That's fine. 15 Q. Okay. Now, you started today 16 by telling us what information you had 17 reviewed in order to prepare to testify here 18 concerning the allegations that Norfolk 19 Southern has made concerning my client, 20 concerning Oxy Vinyls and concerning Trinity 21 in the third-party action that Norfolk 22 Southern filed. 23 Correct? 24 A. Correct. 25 Q. And I want to make sure I|Page 229 1 did not review any other NS documents. 2 Is that correct? 3 A. I believe there was also an NS 4 safety data sheet concerning -- and I refer 5 to it as a safety data sheet. It's not. 6 It's a sheet concerning vinyl chloride -- 7 Q. Okay. 8 A. -- for our HAZMAT team. 9 Q. Any other NS documents that 10 you've reviewed in order to testify here 11 today? 12 A. No. 13 Q. Okay. So if what's been told 14 to us is accurate, NS has reviewed over 15 1.8 million pieces of paper, pages, in 16 connection with this litigation, and the sum 17 and substance of everything you've looked at 18 is what you just identified. 19 Is that correct? 20 From NS's documents, to be 21 accurate. 22 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Vague 23 as to time, and assumes facts not in 24 evidence. Beyond the scope of the 25 30(b)(6) topics.|

1 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS:
2    Q.   You can answer.
3    A.   The only thing that I would
4 state is I can't speak to the million pages
5 you referenced. I can't tell you other than
6 certain documents that I stated I had
7 reviewed.
8        I did not review everything in
9 its entirety, front to back cover, front
10 cover to back cover. So I can't speak to and
11 tell you that I agree with the statement that
12 I reviewed, you know, a million pages of
13 information.
14    Q.   I'm not -- sorry.
15    A.   But I did -- I did review the
16 documents that I stated I reviewed. Again,
17 parts of those documents as pointed out here
18 on this Exhibit 1.
19    Q.   Okay. Perhaps I wasn't clear.
20        I certainly didn't suggest that
21 you reviewed a million pages of information,
22 whatever the volume is of materials that NS
23 has produced from NS's documents. Not the
24 NTSB's documents.
25        Are you with me?


1 me, at least, the sum and substance of what
2 your client -- NS has claimed about GATX.
3 For example, failure to properly maintain
4 Car 23, that's a serious allegation.
5        Correct?
6        MS. PUJARI: Objection. Asked
7    and answered. Calls for a legal
8    conclusion.
9 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS:
10    Q.   You can answer.
11    A.   Please repeat the question.
12    Q.   Would you agree with me that
13 it's serious to assert that GATX did not
14 properly maintain Car 23?
15        MS. PUJARI: Objection. Asked
16    and answered. Calls for a legal
17    conclusion.
18        THE WITNESS: Again, I -- I'm
19    not -- I'm not in a position to,
20    again, categorize. Again, I'm not a
21    lawyer. I'm not in the legal
22    profession. I don't know. Again, is
23    there -- is there something above
24    serious? Is there something below
25    serious?
|Page 231 1 A. I'm with you. 2 Q. From all of NS's documents. 3 In order to prepare to testify 4 here today as to the bases of the claims that 5 are asserted in the third-party complaint for 6 these particular paragraphs, you have told us 7 everything you've reviewed from NS. 8 Is that correct? 9 A. That's correct. 10 Q. Okay. Now, you understand that 11 NS has made some very serious allegations 12 concerning my client, GATX. 13 Correct? 14 A. I understand the allegations in 15 the complaint, correct. 16 Q. And you agree with me that 17 those are serious allegations arising from a 18 very serious incident. 19 Correct? 20 A. I would assume any allegations 21 in a complaint would be considered -- I mean, 22 I don't know how you categorize them, what -- 23 is there anything in here that's not serious? 24 I'm not quite sure. 25 Q. Okay. But you would agree with|Page 233 1 I would say that it's been 2 asserted, and -- 3 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS: 4 Q. Okay. 5 A. -- that's what I would say. 6 Q. All right. So you can't tell 7 me if it's serious. 8 Can you tell me, though, 9 whether it's important to be accurate in 10 terms of what has been alleged against GATX? 11 You understand what "accurate" 12 means, correct? 13 A. Yes, I understand what 14 "accurate" means, and I would say that, yes, 15 it's important to be accurate. 16 Q. And you agree with me that if 17 you're going to rely on the NTSB, you 18 shouldn't cherry-pick some statements that 19 the NTSB said and ignore other relevant 20 statements of the NTSB on that particular 21 subject. 22 Correct? 23 A. I would say that you -- your 24 question, if I understood it correctly, was 25 you shouldn't ignore, nor anything in the|
|---|---|


-----

1 NTSB hearings?
2    Q.   Well, you relied on the NTSB
3 pretty extensively, as reflected in
4 Exhibit 1.
5        Correct?
6    A.   Correct.
7    Q.   And you relied on the hearings
8 that the NTSB held on June 22nd and June 23rd
9 of 2023.
10        Correct?
11    A.   Yeah, we relied on the
12 investigation -13    Q.   Right.
14    A.   -- of the incident -15    Q.   And you relied on -16    A.   -- to some degree.
17    Q.   Sorry.
18        You relied on some reports that
19 the NTSB prepared, like the Mechanical Group
20 Factual Report.
21        Correct?
22    A.   That's correct.
23    Q.   And it's important to not
24 cherry-pick just favorable statements from
25 those hearings or that report if you're


1 y e s .
2    Q.   And the "a qualified mechanical
3 inspector" does not identify who that
4 qualified mechanical inspector works for,
5 does it?
6    A.   No, it doesn't.
7    Q.   But it does say that such a
8 qualified mechanical inspection was, in fact,
9 conducted on February 1st in Madison,
10 I l l i n o i s .
11        C o r r e c t ?
12    A.   Correct.
13    Q.   And so you would expect that
14 there would be some evidence that that
15 mechanical inspection took place.
16        Correct?
17    A.   Yes. As stated here, a
18 qualified mechanical inspector conducted a
19 mechanical inspection and air brake test.
20    Q.   All right. And if I heard you
21 correctly this morning, what you were telling
22 Mr. Denton was, it's your understanding,
23 based on the NTSB hearings, that that
24 qualified mechanical inspection -- inspector
25 was a TRRA employee.
|Page 235 1 trying to depict a truthful statement. 2 Correct? 3 A. I believe that's correct -- 4 Q. Okay. 5 A. -- you shouldn't. 6 Q. You shouldn't. 7 You should be truthful, and you 8 should be accurate, correct? 9 A. That's correct. 10 Q. All right. So let's go then to 11 paragraph 29 of the complaint. And I promise 12 I'm going to try to not repeat what was 13 covered already this morning, but we need to 14 sort of set the stage, if you will. 15 Paragraph 29 was the one 16 Mr. Denton spent quite a bit of time with you 17 on this morning, and that is the paragraph 18 that says that "The train was assembled in 19 Madison, Illinois, and was destined for 20 Conway, Pennsylvania. That on February 1, 21 2023, a qualified mechanical inspector 22 conducted a mechanical inspection and air 23 brake test." 24 That's what's alleged, correct? 25 A. That's what's written here,|Page 237 1 Is that correct? 2 A. That was my understanding, 3 c o r r e c t . 4 Q. Okay. So you would agree with 5 me that in paragraph 29, you were not talking 6 about an NS, Norfolk Southern, qualified 7 mechanical inspector having conducted such an 8 inspection on February 1st of 2023. 9 C o r r e c t ? 10 A. I think what's stated here is 11 that a qualified mechanical inspector 12 conducted a mechanical inspection and air 13 t e s t . 14 When I questioned earlier about 15 who, I believe, had performed that test, my 16 reply was, an employee working for the TRRA. 17 Q. So it should be pretty easy to 18 answer my question, that you were not talking 19 about an NS-qualified mechanical inspector, 20 correct? In paragraph 29. 21 A. In paragraph 29, it's not 22 distinguishing whether it was a TRRA or a 23 Norfolk Southern employee. 24 Q. Right. 25 A. It reads verbatim, "A qualified|
|---|---|


-----

1 mechanical inspector conducted a mechanical
2 inspection and air brake test."
3    Q.   Right.
4        Which is why you, Norfolk
5 Southern, I'm asking you, in paragraph 29,
6 since it doesn't distinguish, is it referring
7 to an NS-qualified mechanical inspector; yes
8 or no?
9    A.   I believe the answer is no.
10    Q.   Thank you.
11        Now, will you agree with me
12 that if NS performed an inspection pursuant
13 to the CFR that you talked about this morning
14 with Mr. Denton, that you would expect,
15 pursuant to NS's policies, that there would
16 be some record of NS having -- thank you -17 having conducted such an inspection?
18        C o r r e c t ?
19    A.   If Norfolk Southern was
20 inspecting a railcar at a Norfolk Southern
21 yard, whether inbound inspection or outbound
22 inspection, we would have a record of the
23 inspection taking place.
24    Q.   It's a good business practice
25 to have a written record if you're going to


1 to the NS crew that, again, the brakes are in
2 good -- good shape, no issues found.
3        TRRA would be, again,
4 responsible for the inbound inspection,
5 outbound inspection, of those railcars.
6 That is something, again, if when we provide
7 an interchange, the inbound or the outbound
8 crew is not going through and looking at
9 individual inspections on every car.
10    Q.   Okay. So let me understand.
11        If TRRA performed that
12 inspection, if TRRA performed that
13 inspection, NS would not expect to see any
14 written documentation of such an inspection.
15        Is that correct?
16    A.   The train crew receiving that
17 train, or getting on the train, would not be
18 looking for any documentation of every single
19 mechanical inspection.
20    Q.   Okay. Would the train crew be
21 looking for any documentation that anything
22 beyond a brake test had been performed as
23 part of this qualified mechanical inspection
24 that is to be done pursuant to Part 215,
25 railroad freedom -- I'm sorry, Railroad
|Page 239 1 conduct a qualified mechanical inspection. 2 C o r r e c t ? 3 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Beyond 4 the scope of the 30(b)(6) topics. 5 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS: 6 Q. You can answer. 7 A. I think Norfolk Southern feels 8 it is a good practice. 9 Q. Thank you. 10 Now, if Norfolk Southern is 11 going to rely on a mechanical inspection 12 performed by TRRA, would you agree with me 13 it's a good business practice for Norfolk 14 Southern to get some written proof that that 15 has been done by TRRA? Correct? 16 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Beyond 17 the scope of the 30(b)(6). 18 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS: 19 Q. You can answer. 20 A. No, not in an interchange. 21 That's not something that you would typically 22 see. You would have a brake slip, a Class I 23 brake slip, on that car, or on that train, as 24 the crew took it from Madison en route to 25 Decatur. And that brake slip would certify|Page 241 1 Freight Car and Safety Standards? 2 MS. PUJARI: Objection. 3 Compound question and combines two 4 different concepts. So, compound. 5 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS: 6 Q. You can answer. 7 A. The outbound train crew would 8 require to get the Class I brake test. 9 They're not going to, like I said before, ask 10 and review mechanical inspection criteria on 11 every car. 12 Q. So is it your testimony on 13 behalf of NS that in order to satisfy 14 Part 215, Railroad Freight Car Safety 15 Standards, and specifically Section 215.13 -- 16 A. Can you tell me what exhibit -- 17 Q. Sure, I'm sorry. That was 18 Exhibit 4 this morning. 19 It's right there, on top of 20 your hand. 21 A. Okay. This is Exhibit 5. 22 Q. Okay. Exhibit 5. Sorry, there 23 seems to have been a misnumbering. 24 But is that stan -- Part 215? 25 A. Yes, this is Part 215.|
|---|---|


-----

1    Q.   Okay. And recall you discussed
2 this with Mr. Denton at length this morning?
3    A.   I had some questions that were
4 presented on 215, yes.
5    Q.   Excellent.
6        And can you turn then to
7 215.13, titled "Predeparture Inspection"?
8    A.   2.13?
9    Q.   215.13.
10    A.   Okay.
11    Q.   Are you there?
12    A.   I'm there now.
13    Q.   Okay. And what it says there
14 is that each -- "At each location where a
15 freight car is placed on a train, the freight
16 car shall be inspected before the train
17 departs."
18        Do you see that?
19    A.   I do.
20    Q.   Okay. And the inspection may
21 be made before or after the car is placed on
22 the train.
23        Correct?
24    A.   Correct.
25    Q.   Is it your testimony in order


1        Does 215 apply to NS in
2 connection with the East Palestine
3 February 3, 2023 derailment; yes or no?
4        MS. PUJARI: Objection. Vague
5    as to which part of 215.
6 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS:
7    Q.   215.13, to be accurate.
8    A.   215.13 at Madison would not
9 pertain to Norfolk Southern mechanical car
10 inspectors doing a predeparture inspection.
11    Q.   Okay. Now, let's look at
12 exhibit -- I think it was -- I'm not sure
13 what number it was, actually. It's from the
14 NTSB. It's titled "Safety Systems Human
15 Performance Group Chair's Factual Report."
16    A.   What document?
17    Q.   8.
18        You with me?
19    A.   I have the document.
20    Q.   It's Exhibit 8. And again,
21 this is one of the documents you looked at
22 this morning with Mr. Denton.
23        C o r r e c t ?
24    A.   It is.
25    Q.   This is not one of the
|Page 243 1 to satisfy 215.13, that NS can rely on TRRA 2 and rely on no written documentation of any 3 such inspection having been conducted? 4 MS. PUJARI: Objection to the 5 extent it calls for a legal conclusion 6 and goes beyond 215.13, sub A. 7 THE WITNESS: Yeah. Please 8 re -- please repeat the question. 9 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS: 10 Q. Sure. 11 You understand that Section 215 12 applies to railroads, correct? 13 A. Yes. 14 Q. It applies to NS, correct? 15 A. It applies to all railways -- 16 Q. But here we're talking about NS 17 in this incident, so I'm asking you about NS. 18 Does 215 apply to NS in 19 connection with the East Palestine derailment 20 that occurred on February 3rd of 2023? 21 A. Predeparture inspection, again, 22 as it reads in the first bullet, at each 23 location -- 24 Q. No, Mr. Dixon, respectfully, I 25 have limited time. Very simple question.|Page 245 1 documents that you relied on, though, in 2 connection with preparing to testify here 3 today. 4 Correct? 5 A. It is not something I reviewed. 6 Q. Okay. So I would like to turn 7 your attention, first of all, to page 5, 8 which you already looked at. 9 Under February 1st, the 10 Madison, Illinois, TRRA yard. And we saw 11 where it says that the train crew conducted 12 predeparture and mechanical inspection of 13 Train 32N. 14 Do you understand what a train 15 crew is in connection with this incident? 16 A. No, I'm not -- I'm not familiar 17 there in Madison, the TRRA yard, what exactly 18 they're stating by train crew conductor. 19 Q. Do you understand the terminal 20 exchange to have a train crew? 21 A. I'm sorry. The question is, do 22 I understand a terminal exchange -- 23 Q. Right. 24 A. -- to have a train crew? 25 Q. Do you think that TRRA train|
|---|---|


-----

1 crew there -- do you see where it says,
2 "Engineer and conductor on duty"? Do you see
3 two bullets up?
4        It's right there, in the
5 interest of time.
6    A.   Yeah, I see that.
7    Q.   Okay. So first it says they're
8 a train crew. It defines them. Engineer and
9 conductor on duty.
10        Do you see that?
11    A.   I see that.
12    Q.   And then just two bullets on -13 then it says, "TRRA employees completed a
14 232.205 Class I air brake test."
15        Correct?
16    A.   Correct.
17    Q.   And then it goes back to "Train
18 crew conducted predeparture/mechanical
19 inspection of Train 32N."
20        Do you see that?
21    A.   I see what's written there.
22    Q.   But you don't know whether that
23 train crew is the engineer and conductor of
24 Norfolk Southern, correct?
25    A.   I don't know.


1 railcars, to maintain railcars, and to do
2 certain repairs of railcars.
3    Q.   Are they Norfolk Southern
4 e m p l o y e e s ?
5    A.   Norfolk Southern has carmen,
6 but these employees -- I'm not sure what this
7 is a reference to. Again, I didn't see this
8 document, but carmen in general, as I stated,
9 they repair, they maintain, and they inspect
10 railcars for repair.
11    Q.   That's what they should do,
12 c o r r e c t ?
13        They should repair -14    A.   That's what -15    Q.   -- they should maintain, and
16 they should inspect railcars for repair.
17        C o r r e c t ?
18    A.   That's what they're -19    Q.   Right.
20    A.   That's what their job is.
21    Q.   Okay. So the NTSB here in its
22 report, referring to section CFR part 215.13,
23 the one I asked you about, says, "At each
24 location where freight railcar is placed on a
25 train, the freight car shall be inspected
|Page 247 1 Q. Okay. 2 A. Again, a train crew would do 3 a -- their own inspection. The engineer 4 would inspect the locomotives that they're 5 taking -- they're getting on. They would do 6 a quick inspection. 7 But again, the train crew here 8 that -- 9 Q. So it's -- 10 A. I know it's written there. 11 Q. Okay. Let's turn to page 12. 12 See if we can help out with figuring out who 13 the train crew is and who purportedly did the 14 predeparture inspection. 15 3.2. Do you see where it says 16 "Carmen Duties"? Do you see that? 17 A. Yes. 18 Q. Do you have an understanding of 19 who carmen are in connection with a 20 predeparture inspection? 21 A. Yes, I do. 22 Q. Who are they? 23 A. Carmen is just that, the car -- 24 railroad carmen. They're employees that are 25 qualified to -- excuse me, to inspect|Page 249 1 before the train departs. The inspection can 2 be made before or after the car is placed on 3 the train." 4 And then it goes on to say that 5 there are at least 90 points of inspection in 6 a railcar. 7 Does NS agree with that? 8 A. I would agree. 9 Q. It goes on then to say that the 10 carman must thoroughly inspect, maintain and 11 repair railcar parts such as gaskets, air 12 hoses, loading restraining equipments and 13 tie-down devices. 14 Do you agree with that? 15 A. Yes. 16 Q. Okay. 17 A. That's a short list of repair 18 car parts, but -- 19 Q. Okay. Let's go to the next 20 p a g e . 21 MS. PUJARI: I'm sorry, can 22 Mr. Dixon finish his answers? 23 THE WITNESS: Yeah. It looks 24 like, again, there -- "carman must 25 thoroughly inspect, maintain rail" --|

1    or "repair railcar parts such as..."
2        And again, I just wanted to
3    point out in reading that, it's a very
4    short list -5 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS:
6    Q.   Right. But let's go to the
7 next page and see what else is on there.
8        It then goes on to say, "The
9 car inspectors also conduct visual
10 inspections for leaky bearings or damaged
11 c o m p o n e n t s . "
12        Does NS agree with that?
13    A.   Yes.
14    Q.   "If they see grease around the
15 bearing seals, they'll get their gauge and
16 slightly pry it to see if it's loose."
17        Does NS agree with that?
18    A.   I can't speak to our carman's
19 work with respect to when -- when they're
20 inspecting a car, I know they're looking. I
21 don't discount what was -- what was said, or
22 I don't have any issue with what was noted on
23 the previous page, 3.2, but I can't speak to
24 what their steps would be if they identified,
25 let's say, excessive leaks.


1    A.   I'm not, again, aware of TRRA's
2 work. I would assume that, again, they were
3 performing either an inbound inspection or an
4 outbound inspection of all railcars that come
5 in and out of TRRA.
6    Q.   So the basis for saying that a
7 mechanical inspection was done, predeparture
8 inspection, with respect to GPLX76545, was it
9 based on anything more than an assumption
10 that that work had been done?
11        MS. PUJARI: Objection.
12    Misstates -13        THE WITNESS: No.
14        MS. PUJARI: -- prior
15    testimony.
16 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS:
17    Q.   Go ahead.
18    A.   No. The chief inspector for
19 the NTSB stated in testimony that all of the
20 railcars in 32N that departed the TRRA there
21 at Madison had both a mechanical inspection
22 and Class I brake test performed.
23    Q.   And that is the sole basis for
24 your belief that such an inspection had been
25 done on GPLX76545.
|Page 251 1 Q. Are you aware of anyone from 2 TRRA or Norfolk Southern looking to see 3 whether there was grease around the bearing 4 seals? 5 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Vague 6 as to -- 7 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS: 8 Q. For -- 9 MS. PUJARI: Sorry, were -- 10 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS: 11 Q. -- GPLX75465. 12 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Vague 13 as to time. 14 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS: 15 Q. I'm sorry, February 1st to 16 February 3rd -- let me ask a different 17 question. 18 Anytime between February 1st 19 until the time of the derailment in 2023, are 20 you aware of anybody from TRRA or Norfolk 21 Southern looking to see whether there was 22 grease around the bearing seals? 23 MS. PUJARI: On which car? 24 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS: 25 Q. In connection with GPLX75465.|Page 253 1 Is that correct? 2 A. In reading the materials in 3 preparation for this, yes, that is why I 4 believe that a mechanical inspection was 5 conducted -- 6 Q. Okay. 7 A. -- on those railcars. 8 Q. Now, if you go on in this same 9 document, it says that the bearings could 10 eventually fail and result -- I'm sorry. 11 It says, "A loose bearing seal 12 could allow water and foreign particles into 13 the bearing while allowing lubricants to 14 escape. The bearing could eventually fail 15 and result in the car and train derailing." 16 Do you agree with that? 17 A. I think I would agree with 18 what's written here. 19 Q. Okay. And therefore, because a 20 loose bearing seal could allow water and 21 foreign particles into the bearing while 22 allowing lubricants to escape, which could 23 result in the car and train derailing, it's 24 important to conduct a proper mechanical 25 in s p e c t io n .|

1        C o r r e c t ?
2    A.   I agree that it is important to
3 comply with all rules, particularly 2.15.
4    Q.   Okay. And if one wanted to
5 know whether, in fact, there was any leaky
6 bearing or damaged component, they should at
7 least comply with the requirements of 215.13.
8        C o r r e c t ?
9    A.   Yeah. I think, again, 215.13
10 should be complied with, yes.
11    Q.   Okay. Now, it goes on here in
12 this NTSB report to say, "Time provided to
13 inspect the train car. During their
14 interviews with the NTSB, the TCU
15 discussed" -- being the Transportation
16 Communications Union -- "discussed the
17 reduction in amount of time carmen have
18 available to inspect cars."
19        Do you know who the
20 Transportation Communications Union is?
21    A.   It's a -- yes, I know the
22 Transportation Communications Union.
23    Q.   Who are they? Tell the jury
24 who that group is that the NTSB is referring
25 to here.


1        Do you see that?
2        MS. PUJARI: Objection. Beyond
3    the scope of the 30(b)(6) topics.
4 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS:
5    Q.   Do you see that?
6    A.   I see that's written.
7    Q.   Okay. And then further on it
8 says, "The TCU indicated in the last few
9 years, following the implementation of new
10 train scheduling strategies, that Norfolk
11 Southern reduced the average amount of time
12 for car inspections to about one minute per
13 c a r . "
14        Is that an accurate statement?
15        MS. PUJARI: Objection. Beyond
16    the scope of the 30(b)(6) topics.
17        THE WITNESS:  That's what's
18    written here. I don't know if that's
19    an accurate statement.
20 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS:
21    Q.   Okay. You agree with me,
22 though, that good business practice is to
23 allow appropriate time, adequate time, to
24 conduct a thorough inspection.
25        C o r r e c t ?
|Page 255 1 A. The TCU is a union that 2 represents clerical employees. 3 Q. I'm sorry? 4 A. TCU is called the 5 Transportation Communications Union, who 6 represents clerical employees. 7 Q. Clerical employees only? 8 A. To my knowledge at Norfolk 9 Southern -- 10 Q. Okay. 11 A. -- they represent clerical 12 e m p lo y e e s . 13 Q. This goes on to say that 14 "During their interview with the NTSB, the 15 TCU discussed the reduction in the amount of 16 time carmen have available to inspect cars. 17 They stated that about 20 years ago, carmen 18 were provided sufficient time, several 19 minutes, to inspect the cars, but that years 20 later, and before new car train scheduling 21 strategies were implemented in Norfolk 22 Southern and some other Class I railroads, 23 that time was reduced, on average, to 24 3 minutes to 3 minutes and 45 minutes {sic} 25 per car."|Page 257 1 MS. PUJARI: Objection to the 2 term of art, "good business practice," 3 to the extent it calls for a legal 4 conclusion, and beyond the scope of 5 the 30(b)(6). 6 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS: 7 Q. You can answer. 8 A. I believe it is good business 9 practice to comply with federal regulations. 10 So whatever time is needed to -- for 11 compliance for, again -- 12 Q. Mr. -- 13 A. -- car inspections is -- I 14 s u p p o r t . 15 Q. Okay. Mr. Dixon, on behalf of 16 Norfolk Southern, can you tell me whether 17 it's a good business practice to allow 18 appropriate and adequate time to conduct a 19 thorough inspection? 20 MS. PUJARI: Same objection to 21 the term of art, legal conclusion, and 22 beyond the scope. 23 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS: 24 Q. If you can't answer the 25 question, just tell me you can't answer it.|

1    A.   Again, we comply and work to -2    Q.   That's not what I asked.
3    A.   We work to comply with all
4 federal regulations. And in -- to comply
5 with that, you have to afford appropriate
6 t i m e .
7    Q.   Okay. So to comply with legal
8 regulations, you have to afford the folks
9 conducting the inspection adequate time to do
10 a thorough inspection.
11        C o r r e c t ?
12    A.   That's why you have federal
13 regulations in place, so these inspections
14 and repairs can be conducted.
15    Q.   All right. Now, part of
16 federal regulations, of course, deal with the
17 responsibility to ensure that you are putting
18 a safe car on your railway.
19        C o r r e c t ?
20    A.   Repeat that statement, please.
21    Q.   Sure.
22        Is there an obligation on
23 behalf of the railroad to comply with safety
24 s t a n d a r d s ?
25    A.   It's an obligation for the


1 filed against my clients.
2        C o r r e c t ?
3    A.   Yes, that Car 23 was improperly
4 m a i n t a i n e d .
5    Q.   All right. Now, let's talk
6 about what the basis for that was.
7        It says under paragraph 111
8 that "Upon information and belief, Car 23 was
9 twice stationary for longer than six months 10 first for 565 days ending in August of 2018,
11 and then again for 206 days ending in May
12 of 2019."
13        C o r r e c t ?
14    A.   That's what it states, yes.
15    Q.   Could you tell me everything
16 that you have -- you, Norfolk Southern, have
17 reviewed in order to make that allegation?
18    A.   I think I'd reference the -19 well, I know I'd reference the Norfolk -- or
20 the National Transportation Safety Board
21 docket Group B, Exhibit 5, the Mechanical
22 Group Factual Report.
23    Q.   So let's look at that.
24        And you agree with me at the
25 beginning that it's important to not
|Page 259 1 railroads to comply with federal regulations 2 regarding railroad responsibilities. 3 Q. Okay. Let's move on in the 4 interest of time. 5 Part of what was alleged was 6 that GATX did not maintain GPLX75365. 7 C o r r e c t ? 8 A. Can you -- 9 Q. Yeah. 10 A. Can you point that out here? 11 Q. Sure. 12 If you look at the complaint 13 and you go specifically to paragraphs -- let 14 me look real quick -- 106 to 114, the Car 23 15 was improperly maintained. That's what 16 Norfolk Southern alleges. 17 C o r r e c t ? 18 A. 106? 19 Q. Right there on top in bold 20 letters, "Car 23 was improperly maintained." 21 C o r r e c t ? 22 A. Yes. 23 Q. All right. And that's the 24 basis, at least in part, for the complaint, 25 third-party complaint, that Norfolk Southern|Page 261 1 selectively pick statements out of reports 2 and cherry-pick statements. 3 C o r r e c t ? 4 A. Yes, I believe I already 5 responded to that question -- 6 Q. Okay. 7 A. -- and that was that I agree 8 with you. 9 (Dixon 30(b)(6) Exhibit 23 10 marked for identification.) 11 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS: 12 Q. So let's mark the Mechanical 13 Group Factual Report as the next exhibit. 14 It's Group B, Exhibit 5. 15 Mr. Dixon, this is the 16 document -- 17 MS. KARIS: I'm sorry, what 18 number are we? My apologies. 19 COURT REPORTER: 23. 20 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS: 21 Q. Okay. And we've marked it as 22 Exhibit 23 now. 23 This is the report that you're 24 relying on in connection with making the 25 allegations in paragraph 111 that we just|
|---|---|

1 looked at.
2        C o r r e c t ?
3    A.   That's correct.
4    Q.   Now, if we look at this report,
5 if you go to page 17 of 18 -- and you have
6 the complaint in front of you as well?
7    A.   Yes.
8    Q.   You have it? Great. Thank
9 y o u .
10        If we look at the complaint
11 first at paragraph 111, what it says there is
12 that "Upon information and belief that this
13 Car 23 was twice stationary for longer than
14 six months."
15        R i g h t ?
16    A.   Yes.
17    Q.   And then it identifies those
18 time periods, 565 days in August of '18 and
19 206 days ending in May of 2019.
20        C o r r e c t ?
21    A.   That's correct.
22    Q.   All right. Now, if we look at
23 the mechanical report at page 17 -- I don't
24 know if we can bring it up. No, we don't
25 have the Bates numbers. Okay.


1 that it was stationary twice over six
2 m o n t h s . "
3        R i g h t ?
4    A.   That's what it states.
5    Q.   And it goes on to say, "Ending
6 in August of 2018, it shows no movement for
7 565 days, and ending in May of 2019, it shows
8 no movement for 206 days."
9        Do you see that?
10    A.   I see that.
11    Q.   Okay. The "upon information
12 and belief" that is in Norfolk Southern's
13 complaint, is it based on a review of any
14 evidence, any record, anything beyond those
15 statement -- two lines that we just read from
16 the mechanical factual report?
17        MS. PUJARI: Objection to the
18    extent it calls for a legal
19    conclusion.
20        THE WITNESS: Yeah. I would
21    say the claim itself obviously is
22    taking a lot of the information from
23    the mechanical report with respect to
24    the car not moving, again, for the
25    designated periods of time.
|Page 263 1 I don't know if this will work. 2 RRD23MR two zeros -- I'm sorry, 005. 3 Let's keep moving, in the 4 interest of time. 5 See at the top of page 17 of -- 6 and for the record, just to make everybody 7 clear, this Mechanical Group Factual Report 8 comes from the NTSB's docket, and it's 9 Exhibit 5 to that docket. 10 And that's what you've 11 identified as the single and sole basis for 12 paragraph 111 in Exhibit 1 where you list 13 what you relied on. 14 C o r r e c t ? 15 A. It is listed here as being 16 reviewed in support of the claim. 17 Q. And you specifically identify 18 page 17. 19 C o r r e c t ? 20 A. Yes. 21 Q. All right. And so if we look 22 at page 17, what it says there is that "there 23 was a review of the last ten years of 24 movement history of car" -- excellent. Thank 25 you so much -- "of car GPLX75465, indicates|Page 265 1 To say that that's, again, what 2 I reviewed and what I'm looking at 3 here would be from the mechanical 4 factual report, I can't speak to if 5 there's any other movement record data 6 of that car during that ten-year 7 period that was reviewed or that we 8 have access to outside of these point 9 in times where, again, the ST -- or 10 the NTSB's factual report is stating 11 no movement for 565 days ending August 12 of 2018, and 206 days ending May 13 of 2019. 14 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS: 15 Q. So I appreciate that nice, long 16 answer. Let me go back. 17 Beyond those two statements, as 18 NS's corporate representative, are you aware 19 of any other evidence concerning the 20 allegations in paragraph 111 of the 21 third-party complaint filed against my 22 c l ie n t ? 23 MS. PUJARI: Objection to the 24 extent it calls for a legal 25 conclusion.|

1 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS:
2    Q.   Yes or no?
3    A.   I'm not aware of any additional
4 i n f o r m a t i o n .
5    Q.   Now, what the NTSB went on to
6 say was that "Although movement is only
7 recorded when equipment moves past a reader
8 on the mainline, cars can be moved within
9 facilities or yards without being recorded."
10        Do you see that?
11    A.   Yes.
12    Q.   That is not in NS's complaint.
13        C o r r e c t ?
14    A.   No.
15    Q.   You agree that the only
16 movement that -- are you familiar with what a
17 CLM is? A CLM report?
18    A.   No.
19    Q.   Do you know how movement of
20 railcars is recorded on these readers that
21 are referenced in the NTSB's factual report?
22    A.   The -- on the mainlines?
23    Q.   Yes.
24    A.   I'm vaguely familiar with

1 facility or yard during that 565-day period
2 in August -- that ended in August of 2018?
3        MS. PUJARI: Objection. Calls
4    for a legal analysis and conclusion.
5 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS:
6    Q.   You can answer.
7    A.   I don't have any information on
8 that question.
9    Q.   Are you aware of anything that
10 Norfolk Southern did to verify whether
11 GPLX75465 had moved within the shipyard -12 I'm sorry, within the rail yard or facility
13 in those 206 days that ended in May of 2019?
14        MS. PUJARI: Objection. Calls
15    for a legal analysis and conclusion.
16        THE WITNESS: Again, I can't
17    answer that question. I don't know if
18    anyone at Norfolk Southern has any
19    information about the movement of that
20    railcar outside of what we had stated
21    or what's been stated here on the
22    c o m p l a i n t .
23 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS:
24    Q.   So when you state in the
25 complaint that the car was twice stationary
|Page 267 1 Q. But you're not familiar with 2 what a CLM report is. 3 Is that correct? 4 A. I'm not aware of the term 5 " C L M . " 6 Q. Did you do anything before 7 filing this complaint to look at the reader 8 history for GPLX75465 over that ten-year 9 p e r io d ? 10 A. Again -- 11 MS. PUJARI: Objection to the 12 extent it calls for a legal conclusion 13 or privileged information. 14 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS: 15 Q. You can answer. 16 A. I have not personally seen any 17 in f o r m a t io n . 18 Q. Not personally. Norfolk 19 Southern. That's why I asked you in the 20 b e g in n in g . 21 A. Again, I don't know the answer 22 to that question. 23 Q. Did Norfolk Southern do 24 anything to determine whether there had been 25 any movement while GPLX75465 was in a|Page 269 1 for longer than six months, would you agree 2 with me that you don't know whether, in fact, 3 the car moved within the rail yard that it 4 was sitting in during those time periods? 5 C o r r e c t ? 6 A. I can't say that I've seen any 7 information about movement within those rail 8 y a r d s . 9 Q. You haven't seen information 10 one way or the other, correct? 11 A. I haven't seen information one 12 way or the other with respect to what? 13 Q. As to whether GPLX76545 {sic} 14 moved while it was in the rail yard for those 15 565 days ending in August of 2018 or 260 -- 16 or 206 days ending in May of 2019. 17 C o r r e c t ? 18 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Vague 19 as to the rail yard. 20 THE WITNESS: I have not seen 21 any movement data for those periods 22 and those points, between those dates, 23 for GPLX75465. 24 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS: 25 Q. Where was that car for those|

1 565 days ending in August of 2018 that it was
2 allegedly stationary?
3    A.   I don't know the answer to that
4 q u e s t i o n .
5    Q.   Where was that car for those
6 206 days that ended in May of 2019?
7    A.   I don't know the answer to that
8 q u e s t i o n .
9    Q.   So when you said it was
10 stationary, you didn't even know where it was
11 s i t t i n g .
12        Is that correct?
13    A.   I'm not -- I'm not aware of
14 exactly where that car was sitting.
15    Q.   How about generally where it
16 was sitting since you don't know exactly
17 where it was sitting? Do you know where it
18 was generally sitting? Do you know what
19 state it was in?

1 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS:
2    Q.   Are you familiar -- sorry.
3    A.   -- outside -- go ahead.
4    Q.   Are you familiar with the
5 service called Railinc?
6    A.   Vaguely.
7    Q.   Tell us what your understanding
8 of Railinc is.
9    A.   My personal knowledge of
10 Railinc is not extensive enough to be
11 discussed in this -- in this setting.
12    Q.   Do you know whether Norfolk
13 Southern has access to Railinc?
14    A.   I believe Norfolk Southern
15 employees do have access to Railinc.
16    Q.   Did Norfolk Southern do
17 anything to determine, can I get the
18 information from Railinc on where this car
19 was sitting before I make these allegations
20 that this car was sitting stationary?
21    A.   Again, I do not know who at
22 Norfolk Southern has information pertaining
23 to the movement of that railcar outside of
24 what -25    Q.   And you -- sorry.
|Page 271 1 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS: 2 Q. And you -- did you know who was 3 leasing that car during that time period? 4 A. No, I do not know who was 5 leasing -- 6 Q. Sitting here now as Norfolk 7 Southern's corporate representative for the 8 allegations alleged in the third-party 9 complaint, do you know which company had 10 possession of that car from 2016, 2017, 2018, 11 all the way to the time of the incident? 12 A. No, I do not know who was 13 leasing that car. 14 Q. You certainly didn't do 15 anything on behalf of Norfolk Southern to 16 figure out where was this car during that 17 time period that we're going to put this in 18 this complaint. 19 C o r r e c t ? 20 MS. PUJARI: Objection. 21 Argumentative. Asked and answered. 22 THE WITNESS: As I stated 23 previously, I don't have any 24 information on the movement of that 25 car --|Page 273 1 A. -- is presented here. 2 Q. You agree with me you shouldn't 3 be making allegations against my client if 4 you don't have a basis for those allegations. 5 C o r r e c t ? 6 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Calls 7 for a legal conclusion and 8 argumentative. 9 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS: 10 Q. Okay. Would you agree with 11 that statement? 12 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Calls 13 for a legal conclusion and 14 argumentative. 15 MS. KARIS: You've made your 16 objections. 17 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS: 18 Q. Sir, can you answer? 19 A. No. I believe that there -- 20 the allegation stands based off what we're 21 pointing to as far as the Mechanical Group 22 Factual Report. 23 Q. Okay. The mechanical factual 24 report which says that "although movement is 25 only recorded when equipment moves past a|

1 reader on the mainline, cars can be moved
2 within facilities or yards without being
3 r e c o r d e d . "
4        That mechanical report,
5 c o r r e c t ?
6    A.   That's correct.
7    Q.   Okay. Let's talk briefly about
8 the allegations that have been made
9 concerning car -- Railcar 29.
10        You understand that Railcar 29
11 was a car that was owned by GATX but had been
12 leased at the time of the incident.
13        Correct?
14    A.   No. I was aware that GTX was
15 the owner of GATX95098.
16    Q.   Did you know who was operating
17 GATX95098 at the time of the incident?
18    A.   I don't know what you're
19 referring to when you say "operating."
20    Q.   Who had control of the car, and
21 whose commodity was in the car?
22        MS. BROZ: Objection. Form.
23        THE WITNESS: Again, I know who
24    the shipper was. I know who the owner
25    was.


1 of construction for tank car GATX95098?
2    A.   Yes.
3        (Dixon 30(b)(6) Exhibit 24
4    marked for identification.)
5 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS:
6    Q.   In the interest of time, we'll
7 move quickly through it.
8        MS. PUJARI: Would you like
9    this marked?
10        MS. KARIS: Yes, please.
11    Sorry. You got to hand it to the
12    court reporter.
13 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS:
14    Q.   Mr. Dixon, do you recognize
15 that?
16        What is that that you're
17 looking at as Exhibit 24?
18    A.   It's an AAR form.
19    Q.   I'm sorry?
20    A.   AAR Form 4-2.
21    Q.   Okay. And have you seen this
22 document before?
23    A.   I have.
24    Q.   I'm sorry?
25    A.   I have seen this document.
|Page 275 1 Are you referring to -- 2 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS: 3 Q. Who was the shipper? 4 A. Okay. The shipper was Oxy 5 Vinyls. 6 Q. And are you aware that they had 7 leased that railcar, that tank car, I should 8 say, at the time of the incident? 9 A. Since they're not the owner of 10 the railcar, I'm assuming that the shipper 11 had leased. 12 Q. All right. Now, there's a 13 reference in paragraph 122 of your complaint 14 that the owner of tank cars carrying 15 hazardous materials are required to continue 16 the certification process, and it's talking 17 about the certification process that goes to 18 tank cars. 19 Correct? 20 A. That's correct. 21 Q. Are you familiar with what a 22 certificate of construction is for a tank 23 car? 24 A. Yes. 25 Q. Have you seen the certificate|Page 277 1 Q. All right. So I would like to 2 direct your attention then to the part at the 3 bottom where it says "Notes." 4 First of all, just to orient 5 ourselves, this is the application for 6 approval and certificate of construction for 7 the car that we've been talking about here, 8 correct, GATX95051 through 95100. 9 You with me? 10 A. Uh-huh. 11 Q. And do you see the date on it? 12 It's 1991. 13 A. Yes. 14 Q. Okay. And do you understand 15 when 95098 was constructed and the 16 certificate of construction application for 17 approval having been submitted? 18 A. I'm sorry, please repeat the 19 question? 20 Q. Sure. 21 Do you know when the car at 22 issue, GATX95098, when that car was approved 23 and a certificate of construction issued? 24 MS. PUJARI: Objection. The 25 document speaks for itself.|

1        THE WITNESS: So you're asking
2    for the date of the approval from -3 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS:
4    Q.   I'm asking you if you know
5 whether GATX95098, whether that car has been
6 approved for use and a construction
7 certificate issued since 1991.
8        MS. PUJARI: Objection. The
9    document speaks for itself.
10        THE WITNESS: Yeah, I'm not
11    sure where exactly on this Form 4-2
12    does it relate to GATX95098.
13 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS:
14    Q.   Okay. Fair point.
15        Do you know -- I mean, you said
16 you've seen the certificate of construction.
17    A.   I've seen certificates of
18 constructions. I'm assuming this was -- what
19 you handed to me was for 95098.
20    Q.   Okay.
21    A.   I don't have anything that I'm
22 looking at this document that tells me that
23 it's for GATX95098.
24    Q.   So do you see the range at the
25 top? It's for 95051 -
1        MS. KARIS: Yes, that's
2    correct.
3        MS. PUJARI: Sorry, can you
4    rephrase?
5        MS. KARIS: The witness didn't
6    say he didn't understand. I don't
7    know why I need to rephrase.
8 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS:
9    Q.   Whether this car was authorized
10 for products that are authorized in DOT 173
11 for which there are no special commodity
12 requirements?
13        MS. PUJARI: Objection. The
14    document speaks for itself.
15 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS:
16    Q.   You can answer.
17    A.   I don't take issue with what's
18 written on the document, which is, again,
19 what was stated. So authorized in DOT 173
20 for which there are no special commodity
21 requirements.
22    Q.   Norfolk Southern has alleged
23 that this car was not authorized to carry VCM
24 as of February 3rd of 2023.
25        Correct?
Page 281
1    A.   I would have to look at
2 additional documentations that were supplied,
3 particularly the NTSB testimony where we have
4 information based off the investigation
5 comparing these railcars to include GATX95098
6 at the point in time of how they were found
7 in the field, at the point in time they were
8 involved in the derailment, and then
9 comparing them back to the certificates of
10 construction.
11    Q.   Has NS done any independent
12 investigation from the NTSB to determine
13 whether GATX95098 was authorized to carry VCM
14 on February 3rd of 2023?
15        MS. PUJARI: Objection to the
16    extent it calls for a legal conclusion
17    and analysis.
18        THE WITNESS: I'm not aware of
19    activity going into the investigation
20    on that. I know that there was
21    investigation that was conducted, that
22    I read, basically stating that the
23    authorization here for this car was,
24    as you had stated under the notes,
25    propylene oxide, and with no special
|Page 279 1 A. Okay. 2 Q. -- through 95100. 3 A. Okay. All right. 4 Q. Okay? So it would fall within 5 that range, correct? 6 A. That's right. 7 Q. Okay. And you see there under 8 Notes, can you read into the record what it 9 says there? 10 A. Notes under number 11? 11 Q. Yes. 12 A. "Propylene oxide and products 13 authorized in DOT 173 for which there are no 14 special commodity requirements and 15 nonregulated commodities compatible with this 16 class of car." 17 Q. So do you understand this to 18 mean that this car is authorized for 19 propylene oxide? Correct? 20 A. Yes. 21 Q. And for products that are 22 authorized in DOT 173 for which there are no 23 special commodity requirements? 24 MS. PUJARI: What is the 25 question? Is it authorized?|Page 281 1 A.

3    NT -- NTSB hearings where the FRA
4    looked and compared -5 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS:
6    Q.   Mr. Dixon, I'm actually going
7 to stop you there, and I'm going to move to
8 strike.
9        My question is not about the
10 NTSB. My question specifically excluded the
11 NTSB. So let me try again.
12        Has Norfolk Southern done any
13 investigation independent of the NTSB to
14 determine whether GATX95098 was authorized to
15 carry vinyl chloride on February 3rd of 2023?
16        MS. PUJARI: Objection. Calls
17    for a legal conclusion and analysis.
18        THE WITNESS: I'm not aware of
19    any activity.

1 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS:
2    Q.   Mr. Dixon, I want to now talk
3 to you about another allegation in the
4 complaint, and that is that GATX Car
5 Number 29, 95098, had tank car valves that
6 were replaced with a Midland 720 valve
7 without approval, at least as alleged by
8 Norfolk Southern.
9        C o r r e c t ?
10    A.   Can you point me to where
11 you're at?
12    Q.   Sure.
13        In the complaint,
14 paragraph 120(b).
15        You with me?
16    A.   I'm with you.
17    Q.   Okay. Now, do you have any
18 evidence that Railcar 29 experienced any
19 polymerization of its vinyl chloride?
20    A.   I haven't seen anything that
21 indicates there was polymerization in Car 29.
22    Q.   Okay.
23    A.   And other than what I
24 previously stated earlier today, there was
25 some white discharge at the vent and burn
|Page 283 1 for over an hour. 2 MS. KARIS: I think Mr. Denton 3 said I could use a few of his minutes 4 there. 5 MR. DENTON: Is Carrie out of 6 time? 7 MS. PUJARI: Yes. 8 MR. DENTON: How about another 9 15, Carrie? It's okay with me. 10 MS. KARIS: Thank you. Thank 11 you. 12 MS. PUJARI: Would you like a 13 break? 14 MS. KARIS: We can take a 15 break. 16 THE WITNESS: Sure. 17 MR. DENTON: We can take a 18 break. 19 VIDEOGRAPHER: 3:54, we are off 20 the video record. 21 (Off the record at 3:54 p.m.) 22 VIDEOGRAPHER: 4:11, we are on 23 the video record. 24 (Dixon 30(b)(6) Exhibits 25 and 25 26 marked for identification.)|Page 285 1 that potentially could indicate something, 2 but there's no -- in my understanding, 3 there's no definitive, final conclusion on 4 that. 5 Q. Okay. Now, you have seen the 6 tank pressures readings that were taken of 7 G A T X 9 5 0 9 8 . 8 C o r r e c t ? 9 A. What tank pressures are you 10 referring to? 11 Q. The tank pressures for car 12 G A T X 9 5 0 9 8 . 13 A. And can you tell me exactly 14 where -- 15 Q. Well, have you seen them, 16 f ir s t ? 17 A.

I believe we had reviewed a 22 document earlier showing temperatures, but, 23 again, is it for the GATX? I'm not quite 24 sure at this time. 25 Q. Okay. We've marked --|

1    A.   Can you point out the
2 temperatures -3    Q.   Sure. Right in front we've
4 just -- right in front of you is Exhibit 25.
5 Let's see if that'll help you.
6        And that comes from the NTSB's
7 docket. It's group D, Exhibit 7, Vinyl
8 Chloride Tank Car Temperature Measurement
9 S p r e a d s h e e t .
10        Do you see that?
11        MS. PUJARI: May I have a copy
12    for counsel?
13        MR. EMMANUEL: Yeah, I
14    apologize.
15        THE WITNESS: I see that.
16 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS:
17    Q.   Have you seen this document
18 p r e v i o u s l y ?
19    A.   I have.
20    Q.   Tell us what this document
21 represents with respect to GATX95098.
22    A.   It shows reading temperatures
23 for GATX95098.
24    Q.   Okay. And you see where it
25 says they are "tank car pressures by the


1 Railway reporting with respect to 95098? Are
2 those pressures?  Are they temperatures?
3 What's the date? What -4    A.   I believe -5    Q.   -- are they recording?
6    A.   I believe earlier we saw a
7 document that showed the graph of the
8 temperatures, and I was asked to review this
9 to see if the temperatures matched. So I
10 would say these are measuring temperatures.
11    Q.   And does it accurately reflect
12 the pressure of GATX95098 as reported by
13 Norfolk Southern?
14    A.   Again, I think this document is
15 just simply mislabeled.
16    Q.   Okay. Mislabeled by whom?
17        MS. PUJARI: Objection. Calls
18    for speculation.
19 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS:
20    Q.   You can answer.
21    A.   I don't know -- I don't know
22 who mislabeled it. I don't know who created
23 the document.
24    Q.   What does the cover of the
25 document say?
|Page 287 1 hour." And it's got time, and it goes from 2 16:00 down to 2 a.m. 3 C o r r e c t? 4 A. Yes. So it says, "tank car 5 pressures by the hour." And then the 6 Group B, Exhibit 7, the title is "Vinyl 7 Chloride Tank Car Temperature Measurements." 8 Q. So do you have any 9 understanding as to whether the tank car 10 pressure remained the same during the time 11 period here that was measured and reported by 12 the NTSB? 13 And that pressure being a 14 consistent 67 at the times that it was 15 m e a s u r e d . 16 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Vague 17 as to date and so as to time and 18 assumes facts not in evidence. 19 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS: 20 Q. Do you see who the agency 21 organization is that provided this document? 22 A. I see. 23 Q. Who is it? 24 A . Norfolk Southern Railway. 25 Q . So what was Norfolk Southern|Page 289 1 Who provided it to the NTSB? 2 A. Norfolk Southern Railway. 3 Q. Thank you. 4 Okay. Let's move on. I've 5 marked there Exhibit 26, which is a Timken 6 m a n u a l. 7 Are you familiar with that 8 document titled "Installing and Maintaining 9 Timken AP and AP-2 Bearings"? 10 A. I've seen some information in 11 t h is . 12 Q. Okay. Do you have any evidence 13 that my client, GATX, ever received this 14 m a n u a l? 15 A. No. 16 Q.

5 wheel bearings?
6    A.   No.
7    Q.   Do you have any evidence of
8 GATX ever performing installation of wheel
9 b e a r i n g s ?
10    A.   I don't believe we have any.
11    Q.   Do you have any evidence of
12 Timken ever communicating with my client,
13 GATX, in connection with any aspect of
14 Exhibit 26?
15    A.   No.
16    Q.   Thank you.
17        Let's talk last topic then,
18 about the temperature readings on the hot box
19 detectors that Norfolk Southern's train was
20 experiencing on the night of February 3,
21 2023, before the derailment took place.
22        You have definitely looked at
23 records of those readings.
24        C o r r e c t ?
25    A.   I have looked at the readings


1 have not seen every single hot box detector
2 r e a d i n g .
3    Q.   Let's see if we can break it
4 down a little simpler.
5        Have you looked at any NS
6 documents to see what NS's internal documents
7 were saying about the readings of the hot box
8 detectors from Salem through East Palestine?
9    A.   Yes, I've seen some Norfolk
10 Southern information.
11    Q.   And have you seen internal
12 Norfolk Southern documents in connection with
13 filing the allegations that you filed in the
14 third-party complaint?
15        That's what I'm trying to get
16 at. Because all the documents on your list,
17 they are the NTSB's documents.
18        So I'm wondering, did you look
19 at any of your own records?
20    A.   Well, you're -21        MS. PUJARI: Objection.

Yes, we have records of hot box 8 detector readings. 9 Q. Did you look at Norfolk 10 Southern's documents concerning the hot box 11 detector readings for NS 32, which derailed 12 the evening February 3rd of 2023? 13 A. Just give me a second here. 14 So we're still -- you're 15 referring to NS 32. You're talking about the 16 32N still, the -- 17 Q. I'm sorry, yes, the train that 18 derailed on February 3rd of 2023, in East 19 P a le s t in e . 20 The hot box detector readings 21 that came from that train the night that it 22 derailed, have you looked at those from NS's 23 d o c u m e n t s ? 24 A. Have I looked at all the 25 readings for the 32N? The answer is, no, I|Page 293 1 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS: 2 Q. Mr. Dixon, let me see if I can 3 break this down. 4 A. No, I understood the question. 5 Let me answer this question first, and then 6 we'll go on. 7 We referenced the NTSB 8 Mechanical Group Factual Report, which is -- 9 contains information supplied to them by 10 Norfolk Southern, so it's Norfolk Southern 11 information. 12 (Dixon 30(b)(6) Exhibit 27 13 marked for identification.) 14 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS: 15 Q. All right. Let's see if we can 16 make this simpler. 17 Let me give you this document, 18 Exhibit 26 {sic}, Bates numbers 19 NS-CA-000249678 through 81. 20 Can you please mark this as the 21 next exhibit, 27? 22 Yes or no: Have you looked at 23 this document in connection -- 24 A.

14    A.   No, I have not reviewed this
15 document.
16    Q.   Okay. Can you just tell us,
17 who is Thomas Fox?
18    A.   Thomas Fox is a -- is a manager

20    Q.   And Mr. Fox here writes to
21 Jamie Williams on February 7, 2023, and he
22 says he's "accumulated the ABD," the acoustic
23 bearing detector, "and other wayside detector
24 metrics for GPLX 75465 as shown below. Let
25 me know if you have any questions." And he


1    as to which reports.
2 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS:
3    Q.   Have you -- I'm sorry. You
4 looked at the mechanical report.
5        Correct?
6    A.   The NT -7    Q.   Yeah.
8    A.   The mechanical factual report.
9    Q.   Can you also pull in front of
10 you the safety system -- safety -- I'm sorry,
11 System Safety and Human Performance Group
12 Chair's Factual Report which we marked as
13 Exhibit 8 to your deposition?
14    A.   (Witness complies.)
15    Q.   Go, if you will, in Exhibit 8
16 to page -- sorry. Haste makes waste, for
17 sure. Just lost it.

19 System and Human Performance. Page 16.
20        You with me?
21    A.   Yes.
22    Q.   Does that table at the top of
23 page 16 accurately reflect the hot box
24 detector readings from Sebring to Salem and
25 then Salem to East Palestine immediately

No indication that this 7 e-mail relates to Train 32N. It's 8 beyond the scope, far beyond the 9 scope. 10 MS. KARIS: It's an interesting 11 position given the subject matter, but 12 okay. 13 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS: 14 Q. Have you seen this before? 15 A. As I stated earlier, I have not 16 seen this. 17 Q. Oh, let's move on then. 18 Let's do this. We're going to 19 cut to the chase because we're running short 20 on time here. 21 You said you've looked at the 22 reports, the NTSB's reports, that speak to 23 the hot box detectors. 24 Is that safe and fair to say? 25 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Vague|Page 297 1 prior to the derailment on February 3rd of 2 2 0 2 3 ? 3 A. The -- they actually reflect 4 the reading at the hot box detector located 5 at Sebring, located at Salem, located at East 6 P a le s t in e . 7 Q. Okay.

1 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS:
2    Q.   Right.
3        So at that point, no alert was
4 triggered at Sebring.
5        C o r r e c t ?
6    A.   That's correct.
7    Q.   The train then goes on, and
8 there's another detector at Salem.
9        C o r r e c t ?
10    A.   That's correct.
11    Q.   And that is at Mile Post 69.01.
12        C o r r e c t ?
13    A.   Yes.
14    Q.   Is that roughly a ten-mile
15 d i s t a n c e ?
16    A.   Roughly.
17    Q.   From the last detector?
18    A.   Yes.
19    Q.   And there, at 8:13 p.m., the L1
20 axle bearing above ambient temperature
21 reading has gone up to 103.
22        C o r r e c t ?
23    A.   The reading was 103 at Salem.
24    Q.   So that's a 65-degree increase
25 over a ten-mile distance.


1    Q.   Sure.
2        Is there any notification sent
3 anywhere, alert, alarm, anywhere, when there
4 is this 83-degree difference between the left
5 and the right axle at 8:13 p.m. at Mile
6 Post 69.01?
7    A.   Yes. At Salem there was an
8 alert that was transmitted after the train
9 had crossed the Salem hot box detector.
10    Q.   And that alert goes where? Who
11 gets it?
12    A.   It goes to the wayside desk,
13 which is -- we have individuals working in
14 Atlanta, so -- and it's located in Atlanta,
15 Georgia. The wayside help desk system, or
16 the wayside desk system, receives the alerts,
17 and they're accessed from that system.
18    Q.   How many people are manning
19 that desk -20        MS. PUJARI: Objection.
21    Vague -22 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS:
23    Q.   -- on the night of February 3rd
24 of 2023, when that alert is sent?
25    A.   We had one person working the
|Page 299 1 C o r r e c t ? 2 A. That's correct. 3 Q. No alarm was triggered. 4 Is that correct? 5 A. That's correct. 6 Q. The right axle, when the left 7 axle is showing 103, is showing a reading of 8 20 degrees above ambient temperature. 9 Is that correct? 10 A. That's correct. 11 Q. Now, for that 103 reading, was 12 there any alarm that was sent to the 13 wayside -- any off-site location? Let's 14 start with that. 15 A. No. 16 Q. So there's a 70-degree -- I'm 17 sorry, 83-degree difference between the left 18 and the right axle, but that doesn't activate 19 an alarm. 20 C o r r e c t ? 21 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Vague 22 as to "alarm." 23 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS: 24 Q. Is that correct? 25 A. Repeat the question, please.|Page 301 1 queue at that point, at that time. 2 Q. And how many different trains 3 does NS have out that that one person is 4 expected to man? 5 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Vague 6 as to time. 7 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS: 8 Q. On the night of February 3rd of 9 2 0 2 3 . 10 A. The -- again, the help desk 11 gets these alerts, so I would say -- I don't 12 know how many alerts they received that day, 13 but ones that would require them to queue up 14 and start looking at things, maybe two or 15 three a shift. 16 Q. Do you recall the video that we 17 watched earlier with the compilation of the 18 train moving from Sebring to Salem to East 19 Palestine -- actually, I think we started 20 just before it got to Salem over to East 21 Palestine -- where the -- there was fire that 22 could visibly be seen in the video? 23 Do you recall that? 24 A. Yes. 25 Q. Do you recall that by the time|
|---|---|


-----

1 the train got to Salem, there was visible
2 fire under the train?
3    A.   Yes. I can't remember exactly
4 where we saw the location on the video, but,
5 yes, I recall watching the video.
6    Q.   So Norfolk Southern's hot box
7 system doesn't trigger an alert to the folks
8 on the train, even though there's a fire that
9 is visible under the train.
10        Is that correct?
11    A.   In this case, again, the hot
12 box detector systems that are set up, the hot
13 box detectors themselves, are looking at
14 these temperature -- ambient temperatures,
15 making comparisons. Again, if they don't -16 there's a certain threshold met, they would
17 send an alarm to the crew. It would be an
18 auto -- audio -- you know, audible, talking
19 alarm to provide direction to the train
20 c r e w s .
21    Q.   On the night of February 3rd,
22 even though when the train got to Salem, Mile
23 Post 69.01, there was fire under the train,
24 there was no alert or alarm sent to the crew
25 on the train.


1        You keep asking me did the crew
2    receive an alarm. The answer is no.
3 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS:
4    Q.   Did the wayside desk notify
5 anybody on the train when the train passed
6 Salem that they got an alert of some sort
7 showing a 70-plus-degree temperature increase
8 from the last mile post that there was a
9 registered reading?
10    A.   Again, the alert was generated
11 because of the fact that it was -- the
12 bearing was not -- over 90 degrees, and what
13 we call the K value, the comparison on the
14 train, that bearing to others, had a value of
15 over 4. That's what set the alert and the
16 queue to be monitored.
17    Q.   Mr. Dixon, my question again
18 is, did the wayside desk notify anybody on
19 the train when they got an alert that the
20 reading from Sebring had gone from 38 degrees
21 above ambient temperature, to Salem,
22 103 degrees above ambient temperature, for
23 the L1 axle bearing; yes or no?
24    A.   At that time when it went over
25 the Salem hot box detector, there was an
|Page 303 1 C o r r e c t ? 2 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Asked 3 and answered. 4 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS: 5 Q. Is that accurate? 6 A. At Salem, there was an alert 7 sent to the wayside help desk. 8 Q. Mr. Dixon, you heard my 9 question. It was about to the crew on the 10 t r a in . 11 Was there an alert or an alarm 12 of any sort sent to the folks that were on 13 the train when the train got to Salem and 14 there was fire under the train? Yes or no. 15 MS. PUJARI: Objection. 16 Assumes facts not in evidence, and 17 asked and answered. 18 THE WITNESS: Again -- 19 MS. PUJARI: Let me finish the 20 objection first before you answer, 21 Mr. Dixon. 22 Go ahead. 23 THE WITNESS: Again, the alert 24 was sent to the wayside help desk. 25 I've stated that in the past.|Page 305 1 alert generated. The wayside help desk did 2 not contact the crew at that point in time in 3 which they received that alert. 4 Q. The train then travels another 5 20 miles. 6 C o r r e c t ? 7 A. Yes, approximately. 8 Q. Travels 20 miles, fire under 9 the train. 10 C o r r e c t ? 11 MS. PUJARI: Objection. 12 Assumes facts not in evidence. 13 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS: 14 Q. The evidence will speak for 15 itself and the video will speak for itself. 16 Do you have any reason to 17 contest, sitting here, that for the next 18 20 miles that train traveled with visible 19 fire under the train from Salem to East 20 P a le s t in e ? 21 MS. PUJARI: Objection. 22 Assumes facts not in evidence. 23 THE WITNESS: I think I would 24 agree that from a video, that at those 25 points in times those videos were|
|---|---|


-----

1    captured, there was obviously
2    something burning.
3 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS:
4    Q.   Something was burning, and it
5 was emitting flames.
6        C o r r e c t ?
7    A.   Correct.
8    Q.   Was there any notification from
9 anybody at the desk to anybody on the train,
10 the conductor, the engineer, the conductor
11 trainee or anyone else, of any problems
12 associated with the train that had flames
13 going under it?
14        MS. PUJARI: Objection.
15    Assumes facts not in evidence.
16        THE WITNESS: As I stated
17    before, there was no communication
18    with the wayside help desk to the
19    train crew following their movement
20    over the hot box detailer -- or hot
21    box detector at Salem.
22 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS:
23    Q.   Does Norfolk Southern stand by
24 its position that -- strike that.
25        Does Norfolk Southern stand by


1    readings, to make sure that, you know,
2    what we're seeing, is there something
3    t r e n d i n g .
4 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS:
5    Q.   Did anybody make that
6 comparison, to look to see what's trending,
7 should we contact the train, the crew on the
8 train, to notify them of what we're seeing?
9 Did anybody make that comparison and look for
10 any trending?
11        MS. PUJARI: Objection.
12    Beyond -13 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS:
14    Q.   Between Salem and East
15 P a l e s t i n e .
16        MS. PUJARI: Objection. Beyond
17    the scope of the 30(b)(6). Not a
18    topic on which this witness is
19    designated.
20 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS:
21    Q.   You can answer, sir.
22    A.   My understanding is that that
23 alert was sent to the wayside help desk, and
24 it was queued for review.
25    Q.   It was queued for the review.
|Page 307 1 the position that even though there is a 2 almost 70-degree increase in temperature over 3 a ten-mile distance, that no alert should be 4 sent to the crew on the train? 5 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Beyond 6 the scope of the 30(b)(6). 7 To the extent Mr. Dixon is 8 answering, he's answering on his own 9 behalf. 10 MS. KARIS: We can disagree 11 about that, but go ahead. 12 THE WITNESS: I would say that 13 again, our system is set up, the hot 14 box detector system is set up, first 15 of all. If it was set to a level to 16 where you would have an audible alarm 17 to the crew, that was the only -- 18 would be the only way you would 19 communicate directly to the crew. 20 The question was, should an 21 alert be set. 22 The alert that would be 23 generated, again, would be an alert 24 that something that needs to be 25 reviewed, compared with other|Page 309 1 Did anybody actually review the 2 data on the night of February 3rd to see how 3 that train's readings were trending between 4 Salem and East Palestine while the train was 5 on fire? 6 A. I'm not -- I'm not aware of 7 anybody reviewing all the data, but you said 8 on that night. Obviously the train, as it 9 passed Salem, when it gets to East Palestine, 10 then obviously the data at some point in time 11 has been reviewed. If that was your 12 q u e s t io n . 13 Q. At that point, the reading is 14 at 253 for the L1 axle bearing above ambient. 15 C o r r e c t ? 16 MS. PUJARI: At what point -- 17 objection. Vague. 18 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS: 19 Q. When the train gets to East 20 Palestine, following up on Mr. Dixon's 21 comment, that obviously the data at some 22 point was reviewed. 23 So my question is, by the time 24 it gets to East Palestine, now it triggers a 25 locomotive alert.|

1        C o r r e c t ?
2        It doesn't just go to the desk.
3 There's an alert that actually goes off, an
4 alarm that goes off on the train.
5        C o r r e c t ?
6    A.   There's an audible alarm that
7 goes off informing the crew.
8    Q.   Right.
9        So my question is, anybody at
10 all from the wayside help desk, at any time
11 before that audible alert goes off on the
12 train, anybody from the wayside desk reach
13 out to anyone on the train and say, hey, I'm
14 looking at the data?
15        No, correct?
16    A.   No.
17    Q.   Are you aware of anybody even
18 looking at the data before the folks on the
19 train get the audible alert?
20    A.   I'm not aware of anybody
21 reviewing the hot box detector data at Salem
22 prior to the train arriving in East
23 P a l e s t i n e .
24    Q.   Would you agree with me it
25 would be a good practice if you're going to


1    expert testimony.
2        THE WITNESS:  I don't believe
3    that that would be a case where you
4    would be wanting to notify the crew
5    every time you had a jump in a bearing
6    temperature off one hot box detector.
7        The crews have a lot that
8    they're responsible to do while
9    they're operating that train, and so
10    that's why you have a trending alert
11    and different types of alerts.
12        What the temperature -- I'm not
13    an expert as to what you set those to,
14    as far as what the variance should be,
15    but to take any type of variance and
16    communicate that directly to the train
17    crew, you would have to -- if you were
18    going to direct them or provide them
19    with information, you're going to be
20    asking them to take some sort of
21    a c t i o n .
22        So until you -- until you get
23    the data that requires you to alert
24    them -- and again, I'm not the expert
25    as to set -- when you say 80 degrees,
|Page 311 1 see a temperature differential of 80 degrees 2 between your left and your right bearing? 3 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Beyond 4 the scope of the 30(b)(6). Calls for 5 expert testimony. 6 MS. KARIS: Counsel, we're 7 not -- we can debate that later 8 whether it's beyond the scope. 9 But go ahead. 10 MS. PUJARI: Not designated -- 11 not -- this witness is not designated 12 for this topic. 13 MS. KARIS: Okay. Let me 14 finish the question. Let me reread 15 the question. 16 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS: 17 Q. Would you agree with me it 18 would be a good practice, if you're going to 19 see a temperature differential of 20 approximately 70 degrees over a ten-mile 21 distance and an 83-degree temperature 22 differential between your left and your right 23 axle, to notify the crew on the train? 24 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Beyond 25 the scope of the 30(b)(6). Calls for|Page 313 1 I don't know if that's something that 2 should be communicated or not. 3 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS: 4 Q. You have three people on the 5 train that you would be communicating to, 6 c o r r e c t ? 7 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Beyond 8 the scope. Calls for expert testimony 9 and goes way beyond the scope of the 10 30(b)(6). 11 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS: 12 Q.

KARIS: Counsel, I'm going 16 to address the beyond the scope in a 17 second. 18 But go ahead. 19 THE WITNESS: There were three 20 employees, to my understanding. 21 QUESTIONS BY MS. KARIS: 22 Q.

12        CROSS-EXAMINATION
13 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:
14    Q.   Mr. Dixon, good afternoon. My
15 name is Brian Swanson. I represent Trinity,
16 and I have a few questions for you this
17 afternoon.
18        Okay?
19    A.   Okay.
20    Q.   All right. So to start with, I
21 have put before you what's been marked as
22 Exhibit 28. This is Trinity's cross-notice
23 of Rule 30(b)(6) videotaped deposition of
24 Norfolk Southern.
25        Take a quick look. I'm not


1    Q.   Terrific.
2        And those additional
3 paragraphs, just for the record, are
4 paragraphs 153, 154 and 190 of the
5 third-party complaint.
6        Correct?
7        That's on page 2. Oh, you just
8 passed it. Here you go.
9    A.   Okay.
10    Q.   See those?
11    A.   Yes.
12    Q.   Are you ready to talk about
13 those?
14    A.   Yes.
15    Q.   Terrific.
16        Okay. Before we dive into the
17 complaint and the allegations, just to sort
18 of set things up from Trinity's perspective,
19 Norfolk Southern's claims against Trinity
20 relate to a single VCM car that Trinity
21 leased to Oxy Vinyls.
22        Correct?
23    A.   What car are you referring to?
24    Q.   I'm referring to -- it's -- you
25 call it Car 26, or TILX402025.
|Page 315 1 going to spend a lot of time, but have you 2 seen this before? 3 A. I've seen the topic here, 4 but -- 5 Q. Well, maybe I can speed it up. 6 If you look at page 2. So this 7 morning you were provided by the -- by 8 plaintiff's counsel a 30(b)(6) deposition 9 notice, and we've been through that, and 10 you've talked about some of the allegations 11 in that notice. 12 Correct? 13 A. Correct. 14 Q. What Trinity did is we sent out 15 a notice that incorporated that -- the 16 previous notice that you've seen and then 17 added three paragraphs from the amended 18 complaint that we'd like to discuss with you. 19 Do you understand that? 20 A. I understand. 21 Q. And you're prepared to talk 22 about those additional paragraphs as the 23 corporate representative of Norfolk Southern. 24 True? 25 A. That's true.|Page 317 1 Do you see that? 2 A. Yes. 3 Q. And Trinity's claim -- or 4 excuse me. Norfolk Southern's claims against 5 Trinity relate solely to that car. 6 Correct? 7 A. My understanding is that is 8 correct. 9 Q. And that was one of the five 10 VCM cars that derailed on February 3rd in 11 East Palestine. 12 Right? 13 A. That's one of the five vinyl 14 chloride cars, correct. 15 Q. Norfolk Southern does not claim 16 that Car 26, or TILX402025, was in any way 17 responsible for causing the derailment of 18 Train 32N. 19 Right? 20 A. Again, I wouldn't -- the 21 cause -- the derailment cause, I think, is 22 still under investigation, but I don't 23 believe, again, there's any -- there's any 24 root cause for the actual derailment assigned 25 at this point in time to TILX402025.|

1    Q.   Right.
2        I mean, Norfolk Southern has
3 sued Trinity, right? Right, sir?
4    A.   That's correct.
5    Q.   And in that lawsuit, you do not
6 claim that Car 26, or 402025, was in any way
7 responsible for causing the derailment of
8 32N.
9        Right?
10    A.   I don't have any indication
11 that we are making that claim.
12    Q.   And you testified to that as
13 the representative of Norfolk Southern.
14        Right?
15    A.   What I would -- what I would
16 claim is, again, what we've stated in the
17 claims on certain paragraphs, such as, you
18 know, providing ordinary care, failing to
19 properly certify the design, build and
20 conversion testing, modifications to tank
21 cars and their components with both Trinity
22 and Oxy Vinyls and GATX.
23    Q.   Sir, we're going to get into
24 the allegations you have made against
25 Trinity. I thought my question was pretty


1 of Norfolk Southern's complaint labeled the
2 Derailment Response.
3        Right?
4    A.   Correct.
5    Q.   Paragraph 74 begins, "By
6 midnight, a unified command team was formed,
7 comprised of," and then it lists a number of
8 entities comprising that unified command
9 team.
10        Right?
11    A.   Correct.
12    Q.   One of the entities that's
13 listed is the Norfolk Southern HAZMAT team.
14        Do you see that?
15    A.   I do see that.
16    Q.   Who were the members of the
17 Norfolk Southern HAZMAT team?
18    A.   I would have to look at every
19 one represented there. I don't -- I couldn't
20 tell you.
21    Q.   Can you tell me anyone?
22    A.   I would say -- I could probably
23 name one.
24    Q.   Who is that?
25    A.   Robert Wood.
|Page 319 1 simple. 2 You do not allege in your 3 complaint that Trinity's Car 402025 had 4 anything to do with causing the derailment. 5 Correct? 6 A. Again, as I stated before, I 7 don't believe that we have any information 8 right now that definitively states what 9 caused the derailment. There is -- there is 10 right now nothing I can point to that says, 11 again, Car 26, TILX402025, caused the 32N 12 derailment. 13 Q. Let's, if you could, please, 14 open or take out Exhibit 4. That's the 15 third-party complaint that you've been 16 testifying about so far today. 17 And I'm going to try to go 18 through it in some order, and I'll start, if 19 you can please turn to paragraph 74, which is 20 on page 16. 21 Are you there? 22 A. Page 70 -- I mean, 74? 23 Q. Yeah, page 16. 24 A. Yes, I'm there. 25 Q. Okay. And this is in a section|Page 321 1 Q. And you testified about him 2 earlier today. 3 Right? 4 A. Correct. 5 Q. Can't name anyone else as you 6 sit here today? 7 A. No, not off memory. 8 Q. All right. Let me see if I can 9 jog your memory. 10 Do you know Drew McCarty from 11 SPSI, or Specialized Professional Services, 12 Inc.? 13 A. No, I don't know Drew McCarty. 14 Q. Do you know that entity, SPSI? 15 A. Yes. 16 Q. Is SPSI a contractor for 17 Norfolk Southern? 18 A. Yes, they are. 19 Q. Do you work with them 20 occasionally on train derailments like this 21 one? 22 A. Yes. 23 Q. Did SPSI have folks on the 24 ground at East Palestine after the derailment 25 advising on derailment response?|
|---|---|


-----

1    A.   SPSI had representatives at
2 East Palestine.
3    Q.   And as part of preparing for
4 this deposition, did you read any interviews
5 or testimony from folks at SPSI?
6    A.   There was some information, or
7 SPSI was mentioned in several locations
8 throughout the documents.
9    Q.   Do you recall reading anything
10 from SPSI that you thought was untrue or
11 incorrect?
12    A.   Nothing struck me as being
13 untrue.
14    Q.   Do you know a Charles Day or
15 Chip Day from Specialized Response Solutions,
16 or SRS?
17    A.   I don't know that individual
18 personally.
19    Q.   I apologize if I didn't ask
20 you.
21        Were individuals from SPSI part
22 of the Norfolk Southern HAZMAT team?
23    A.   They were working as
24 contractors for Norfolk Southern. I
25 wouldn't -- I mean, as they -- were they part


1    A.   No, I was just going to say,
2 not only just Norfolk Southern, but pretty
3 much everybody on this united command team if
4 they had the need for other instances.
5        In other words, there's not a
6 large number of these specialized groups out
7 there to deal with the types of situations.
8    Q.   What was the specific role of
9 the Norfolk Southern HAZMAT team in the
10 unified command structure?
11    A.   I'm not privy to the role the
12 NS team played as opposed to the other team
13 members.
14    Q.   Well, did the NS team -- you've
15 testified about this a bit this morning, this
16 afternoon.
17        But did the NS HAZMAT team
18 advise on how to handle the derailed VCM
19 cars?
20    A.   They -- I think everybody in
21 the command team had some input, and
22 obviously Norfolk Southern's HAZMAT team
23 would have input and provide guidance.
24    Q.   So the Norfolk Southern HAZMAT
25 team, they had input at the unified command
|Page 323 1 of the unified command team? They probably 2 were, again, assisting. 3 Q. They were at least assisting 4 Norfolk Southern in its role as a member of 5 the unified command team? 6 A. I would say that they were 7 assisting the unified command team. 8 Q. Okay. And is that the same for 9 Specialized Response Solutions, or SRS? 10 A. Yes. 11 Q. Are they another Norfolk 12 Southern contractor? 13 A. They were another group that 14 Norfolk Southern brought in to assist. 15 Q. Another -- 16 A. Contractor. 17 Q. Another contractor that Norfolk 18 Southern works with from time to time on 19 train derailments? 20 A. Occasionally, again, depending 21 on the situation, as well as pretty much 22 everybody else on that united command team, 23 if needed. 24 Q. I didn't mean to interrupt you, 25 I'm sorry.|Page 325 1 on whether to conduct a vent and burn, for 2 example. 3 True? 4 A. I believe, again, I believe 5 everybody on the command team had the 6 opportunity to provide input. 7 Q. Okay. I'm asking about Norfolk 8 Southern HAZMAT team. 9 A. Which I would agree. 10 Q. Okay. 11 A. Norfolk Southern as well. 12 Q. And that Norfolk Southern 13 HAZMAT team, they had input at the unified 14 command on whether polymerization was 15 occurring in any of the derailed VCM cars. 16 True? 17 A. I think, as we've heard from a 18 number of people today, a lot of people were 19 providing input as to whether or not 20 polymerization or -- 21 Q. Again, I'm focused on Norfolk 22 Southern at the unified command. 23 The Norfolk Southern HAZMAT 24 team had input at the unified command on 25 whether polymerization was occurring within|
|---|---|


-----

1 any of the derailed VCM cars.
2        Right?
3    A.   They had input with their
4 thoughts with respect to polymerization.
5    Q.   Now, no one from Trinity
6 provided any input or advised on whether a
7 vent and burn operation should be performed
8 on the derailed VCM cars.
9        Right?
10    A.   I don't have any information
11 that says that Trinity provided any input.
12    Q.   So based on your knowledge as a
13 corporate representative of Norfolk Southern,
14 Trinity had no input on whether to perform
15 the vent and burn operation.
16        True?
17    A.   Again, I don't have any
18 information that claims Trinity had any input
19 on any of the rail cleanup.
20    Q.   Okay. So the answer to my
21 question is, correct, true.
22        Right?
23        MS. PUJARI: Objection. Asked
24    and answered.
25        THE WITNESS: Could you repeat


1 that anyone from Trinity advised on whether
2 polymerization was or was not occurring in
3 any of the derailed VCM cars.
4        True?
5    A.   I haven't seen any, again,
6 information that Trinity provided.
7    Q.   Flip a page, please, to
8 page 17. I want to look at paragraph 81.
9        Are you there?
10    A.   I'm there.
11    Q.   Paragraph 81 reads, "Following
12 a tank car derailment and fire, responders
13 typically have four options."
14        Do you see that?
15    A.   I see that.
16    Q.   So focusing to begin on the
17 first option, it says, "First, responders can
18 re-rail the tank car and move it to the next
19 destination if they determine there is no
20 tank damage."
21        Do you see that?
22    A.   I do see that.
23    Q.   And at some point in time,
24 re-railing one or more of the vinyl chloride
25 cars was something that unified command
|Page 327 1 your question -- 2 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON: 3 Q. Sure can. 4 A. -- because I'm just trying -- 5 Q. Yeah, yeah, you bet. 6 A. -- to provide with you an 7 appropriate response. 8 But go ahead and ask your 9 question again. 10 Q. No one from Trinity advised the 11 unified command whether or not it should 12 perform a vent and burn operation on the 13 derailed VCM cars. 14 Correct? 15 A. And again, it's not correct or 16 not correct, because I don't know, other 17 than -- I don't have any information that 18 leads me to believe Trinity provided any 19 information to that command team, to that 20 incident command group. Again, I don't know. 21 Did somebody at Trinity call 22 somebody? I don't know. I have seen no 23 information at all that any information was 24 provided to that -- to that team. 25 Q. You've also seen no information|Page 329 1 considered. 2 Right? 3 A. Yes. I would say that they did 4 consider that. 5 Q. Yeah. 6 And the folks at Norfolk 7 Southern and at SPSI and at SRS, they helped 8 advise on that, didn't they? 9 A. I would assume, again, 10 everybody on that team was looking through 11 each one of these options. 12 Q. Okay. Now, focused on Norfolk 13 Southern and its contractors that it hired, 14 would Norfolk Southern consider re-railing a 15 tank car that it determined was not stable? 16 A. No. 17 MS. PUJARI: Objection. 18 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON: 19 Q. Why not? 20 A. For safety reasons. 21 Q. Would Norfolk Southern or its 22 contractors consider re-railing a car if that 23 tank car's pressure release device was not 24 functioning properly? 25 A. Again, if you're having a|
|---|---|


-----

1 release, then you're not going to put -2 you're not going to re-rail a car that is
3 having a pressure release -4    Q.   Okay.
5    A.   -- the valve release product.
6    Q.   So if you don't think the
7 pressure release device is working properly,
8 you're not going to put that car back on the
9 rails.
10        Right?
11    A.   Again, it's one of those, is
12 there a -- is there -- there has to be an
13 assessment of the risk associated with the
14 damage that could potentially occur.
15        If you're asking me if you have
16 a tank car where the PRDs are not working,
17 would you put that back on the rail, well, if
18 you've had -- if you have no product in a car
19 and there's -- it's just literally an empty
20 tank, and the PRDs are no longer functional
21 and there's no risk, then the answer would
22 be, yes, I don't believe there would be any
23 issue with re-railing the tank and moving it.
24    Q.   Okay. But if a car still has
25 VCM in it, would you re-rail that car if the


1    Q.   Okay. Now, if I look at
2 paragraph 81, it says that the second option
3 in responding to a derailment is, "If the
4 tank car is damaged and cannot be safely
5 re-railed and moved, responders can transfer
6 the product from the tank car using the
7 transfer valves."
8        Right?
9    A.   Yes, I see that.
10    Q.   And then number 3 talks about
11 hot tapping.
12        Right?
13    A.   Yes.
14    Q.   And then the fourth option, it
15 talks about -- you say the last resort is the
16 vent and burn.
17        Right?
18    A.   Within paragraph 81, it does
19 mention vent and burn is the fourth option.
20    Q.   Right.
21        And they say vent and burn is
22 the last resort, right?
23    A.   Yeah, that's what it says here.
24    Q.   And it's a last resort because
25 when you vent and burn, you send all sorts of
|Page 331 1 PRD, or pressure release device, was not 2 functioning properly? 3 A. I'm not, again, the technical 4 expert on that, so, again, I would leave that 5 up to our HAZMAT specialists and safety 6 group. 7 Q. Would Norfolk Southern consider 8 re-railing a tank car if they believed that 9 vinyl chloride in that tank car was actively 10 polymerizing? 11 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Calls 12 for expert testimony. 13 THE WITNESS: Again, I'm not an 14 expert in that field, but I would not 15 believe that anybody would re-rail a 16 car that was actively -- 17 polymerization was occurring. 18 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON: 19 Q. Or at risk for -- 20 A. Or at risk. They felt there 21 was a risk for that. 22 Q. Okay. Same thing. That 23 wouldn't be safe to do that. 24 Right? 25 A. Correct.|Page 333 1 chemicals up into the environment and onto 2 the ground. 3 Right? 4 A. Well, there's -- yes, I mean, 5 that's one of those things where you're 6 thinking, okay, here's my options. This is 7 what we want to do first, second, third, and 8 you work through. 9 I'm not -- again, I'm not an 10 expert in HAZMAT, so I can't tell you exactly 11 why that fourth option, they refer to it as 12 the last resort, other than they've come to a 13 conclusion that there's no other steps to 14 take in order to control whatever hazard is 15 still being presented, right? 16 So if there is believed, 17 perceived risk, they're trying to work 18 through, how do we elevate the perceived risk 19 and the hazard that's being presented. 20 So if they're saying, look, 21 this is our last resort because we've got a 22 risk here that we can't ignore, and I'm 23 looking down through my choices, then, yes, 24 they're going to try to mitigate the risk, 25 the safety risk, that's being presented to|
|---|---|


-----

1 them. And if that's their last resort, then,
2 yes, that's why I guess they're saying that's
3 their last resort.
4    Q.   What about -- what about just
5 moving a tank car? I mean, you can move it
6 back onto the rails, but you can also move it
7 away from a fire.
8        Right? Is that an option?
9    A.   The same concerns with
10 re-railing that you spoke to earlier would
11 apply to moving it. Whether it's re-railing
12 it, moving it by train or putting it on a
13 truck or whatever the case, I think the same
14 type of decisions are being assessed, or
15 risks are being assessed.
16    Q.   Got it.
17        But if a car, if a derailed
18 car, was deemed to be stable, one option you
19 would have, rather than re-railing it, is
20 just to move it out of the way of fires and
21 other perceived dangers.
22        Right?
23        MS. PUJARI: Objection. Vague
24    as to "stable."
25        THE WITNESS: Yeah. What -
1 know better than anybody here about the
2 structure of the tank car. Anytime one of
3 those cars hits the ground off the rail,
4 there's potential for structural integrity
5 issues.
6        You know, if you're only
7 looking at the jacket and then the thermal
8 protection system, there's -- again, an
9 assessment is going to be made about moving
10 that car because, again, you have to make an
11 assessment as to what the risk is. And quite
12 honestly, with all of the safety data sheets
13 that I've seen with respect to vinyl
14 chloride, I don't think anybody that looked
15 at that safety data sheet could tell you that
16 a single one of those vinyl chloride cars
17 that had sat in those pool fires for the
18 amount of time that it did, that that would
19 be considered stored -- stored appropriately.
20    Q.   Let me ask you a different
21 question. Let me ask you a different
22 question.
23        If a car -- if a tank car, a
24 VCM tank car, was in -- in a position where
25 it was deemed it could be re-railed, okay?
|Page 335 1 when you say "stable," what are you 2 referring to? 3 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON: 4 Q. Well -- 5 A. When a car is stable, so 6 what -- 7 Q. Okay. 8 A. I want to answer your question. 9 Q. Yeah, I know you do. I know 10 you do. 11 So if a car is exhibiting the 12 characteristics that it was exhibiting when 13 it was on the rail before it had derailed, 14 okay, in terms of pressure and temperature, 15 it's stable. 16 Okay? Right? Are you with me? 17 That's what I'm talking about as stable? 18 A. According to -- you stated 19 pressure and temperature. 20 Q. Temperature. Use those two. 21 A. In a derailment -- and you're 22 referring to tank cars? 23 Q. I am, sir. 24 A. Okay. Anytime a tank car is 25 derailed, there is potentially -- and you|Page 337 1 You with me? 2 A. I'm with you. 3 Q. So the folks at Norfolk 4 Southern say, we can re-rail this car. It's 5 possible to re-rail. It's safe enough to 6 re-rail it. 7 Okay? 8 Another option, if you couldn't 9 re-rail it, would just be to move it out of 10 the way of danger. 11 Right? 12 A. If you made the risk of 13 allowing that tank just to sit there, yes, 14 could you potentially move it? 15 Again, you take -- you would 16 literally make an assessment -- 17 Q. Yeah. 18 A. -- as to what is in the best 19 interests at that point in time for the 20 safety of everybody, to include the personnel 21 and all of the individuals in the community. 22 Q. Yep. Got it. Okay. Thanks. 23 Let's move along, if we can, to 24 paragraph 94. This is again a paragraph 25 that's dealing with the response to the|
|---|---|


-----

1 derailment.
2        Okay?
3        Paragraph 94 begins,
4 "Responders attempted to collect further tank
5 car measurements while they continued
6 collecting potential readings through the
7 small holes in the jackets."
8        And you know that refers to
9 temperature readings.
10        Right?
11    A.   Right.
12    Q.   Yeah.
13        "Responders were unable to
14 collect internal tank pressure measurements
15 due to the comprised valve assemblies and
16 risk of placing personnel alongside
17 dangerously unstable cars."
18        Did I read that correctly?
19    A.   You did.
20        And could you repeat your last
21 question for me? You wanted me to confirm
22 what these tank pressure measurements were or
23 are?
24    Q.   Yeah. It refers to readings
25 through the small holes in the jackets, and


1    Q.   Yeah, you bet I can, but I'm
2 first asking you if you know that's true or
3 not.
4    A.   Again, I'm going to have to
5 look at the documentation.
6    Q.   Okay. So you don't know that
7 Norfolk Southern's own contractors were able
8 to hook up a gauge to TILX402025 and get its
9 pressure readings? You didn't know that?
10    A.   I believe there was one tank
11 car whose valves were not damaged to the
12 extent that, yes, they could get a reading.
13    Q.   Okay. So let's look at the
14 exhibit previously marked as Exhibit 13.
15        Do you have that in front of
16 you?
17    A.   I'm trying to find it here. I
18 don't have it in front of me. It's a
19 hazardous -- okay.
20    Q.   Do you have that in front of
21 you, sir?
22    A.   I do.
23    Q.   And I'm going to ask you to
24 turn, if you can, please, to page 82 of 158.
25        Are you there?
|Page 339 1 that refers to temperature readings. 2 Correct? 3 A. I would say that if you're 4 trying to access the tank, that would 5 probably be a temperature reading. 6 Q. Okay. And now I want to focus 7 on this allegation that Norfolk Southern made 8 that responders were unable to collect 9 internal tank pressure measurements. 10 Okay? 11 All right, sir? 12 A. Okay. 13 Q. And you know now that that 14 allegation is untrue. 15 Right? 16 A. What allegation are you saying 17 is not untrue? I'm sorry, is untrue? 18 Q. That responders were unable to 19 collect internal tank pressure measurements 20 from any tank cars. 21 That's not true, is it, sir? 22 A. Can you show me any of the 23 documentation that says that they were able 24 to collect internal tank pressure 25 measurements?|Page 341 1 A. I'm on page 82, yes. 2 Q. Okay. And if you look at the 3 very last paragraph on page 82, you see 4 there, "The SRS damage assessment of the VCM 5 tank cars on the morning of February 5th." 6 Do you see that? 7 A. Yes. 8 Q. Okay. So that's just to 9 situate us on the date there, February 5. 10 The very last word on that 11 page, and then we're going to continue to 12 page 83. 13 Okay? 14 So it says, it reads, "Crews 15 attached a pressure gauge to 28 TILX402025 16 and found a tank pressure of 60 PSIG." 17 Do you see that? 18 A. I do. 19 Q. You understand, sir, that 20 60 PSIG is a normal pressure reading from a 21 tank containing stabilized vinyl chloride 22 monomer? 23 A. Again, I believe I've seen that 24 as a -- as a tank pressure for vinyl 25 chloride, but, again, I'm not an expert, so|
|---|---|


-----

1 I'm not -- I don't know if I would just come
2 out and say I agree with that, but I believe
3 I've seen that as the normal temperature -4    Q.   Sure. And -5    A.   Tank pressure.
6    Q.   -- you certainly don't claim
7 that 60 PSIG is an abnormally high pressure
8 reading for a VCM tank, right?
9    A.   I would agree with that.
10    Q.   And you know now that the
11 Norfolk Southern contractors continued to
12 monitor the pressure of TILX402025 from that
13 point forward.
14        True?
15    A.   It's true.
16    Q.   You know also that the pressure
17 readings on TILX402025 never exceeded
18 65 PSIG.
19        Right?
20    A.   I'm not familiar with that, so
21 can you point me to a document that shows the
22 pressure readings were -- of 65 -23    Q.   If you don't know, I'm not
24 going to -- I'm not going to ask you more.
25        You don't know?


1    temperature is a potential concern.
2    And I believe it was less than
3    10 degrees or so at East Palestine
4    during the point in time of
5    derailment.
6 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:
7    Q.   Okay.
8    A.   So I don't -- I wouldn't -- I
9 wouldn't agree with your statement, sir.
10    Q.   You don't consider yourself an
11 expert on that, do you?
12    A.   I don't.
13    Q.   And the folks at SPSI who are
14 on the ground at the time, they would have
15 more expertise in that area?
16        Is that fair?
17    A.   I believe all the HAZMAT
18 representatives that were on the ground from
19 Norfolk Southern and their contractors would
20 have more expertise than myself, yes.
21    Q.   That's why they're there,
22 right?
23    A.   That's right.
24    Q.   Okay. Let's look -- let's look
25 at paragraph 96, if we can flip back and
|Page 343 1 A. Again, I'm not following where 2 you got the 65 -- never exceeded 65. 3 Q. Do you know one way or the 4 other? That's my question. 5 A. At this point, I'm not sure. 6 Q. Okay. And we've seen the 7 temperature readings that were obtained from 8 TILX402025. 9 Right? 10 A. Yes, I believe we've seen some 11 temperature readings. 12 Q. And those temperature readings 13 were normal. 14 True? 15 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Vague. 16 THE WITNESS: No, I don't -- I 17 wouldn't say that those temperature 18 readings were normal. 19 Again, I believe if you look at 20 some of the material that was 21 provided, such as the Vinyl Chloride 22 Institute's data and other material 23 concerning vinyl chloride, that any 24 type of temperature on a vinyl 25 chloride tank car that's above ambient|Page 345 1 forth. 2 But I'm going to come back to 3 Exhibit 13, so don't put it too far from you. 4 A. All right. 5 Q. Okay. So I'm going to look at, 6 again, paragraph 96. 7 And we've talked a lot about 8 the vent and burn decision. I'm not going to 9 go over everything again. 10 But I just want to look at 11 that -- on 96, at paragraph 96, midway 12 through, it says, "By approximately noon, 13 unified command agreed that a vent and burn 14 of all five vinyl chloride tank cars, cars 15 26, 27, 28, 29 and 53, should occur." 16 Right? 17 A. That's what -- yes. 18 Q. And that was a recommendation, 19 you've testified about, that was made to the 20 unified command by the -- by the folks at 21 Norfolk Southern who were on the ground. 22 Right? 23 MS. PUJARI: Objection. 24 Mischaracterizes prior testimony. 25 THE WITNESS: Yeah, I think|
|---|---|


-----

1    the -- I think what was -- the
2    recommendation, again, was coming from
3    a number of sources over a period of
4    time from a number of people on the -5    within the incident command group.
6 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:
7    Q.   Didn't say Norfolk Southern was
8 alone. I just want your testimony.
9        Norfolk Southern was
10 recommending that all five vinyl chloride
11 cars being vented and burned.
12        Correct?
13        MS. PUJARI: Objection.
14    Mischaracterizes prior testimony.
15        THE WITNESS: I believe Norfolk
16    Southern, again, came to that
17    conclusion with the team of -- looking
18    at all the data, again, over a period
19    of time.
20 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:
21    Q.   Now, when Norfolk Southern, you
22 said, came to that conclusion to vent and
23 burn Trinity's car 402025, that car was
24 stable, wasn't it?
25        MS. PUJARI: Objection. Vague


1 to...
2    Q.   To sit there, do nothing?
3    A.   To sit there and do nothing -4    Q.   Right.
5    A.   -- with the concern that you
6 were looking at a potential explosion.
7    Q.   Let me ask you. Let's see what
8 the folks on the ground thought about 402025.
9        If you can turn again, please,
10 to Exhibit 13.
11        And when I say "folks on the
12 ground," I mean Norfolk Southern and its
13 contractors.
14        Okay?
15        Do you have Exhibit 13 up? Or,
16 excuse me, in front of you?
17    A.   I have 13 in front of me.
18    Q.   Okay. And if you could please
19 turn to page 85.
20        You see the middle paragraph
21 there begins "Following that"?
22        See that?
23        It says, "Following that, SRS
24 crews."
25        And those are the contractors
|Page 347 1 as to "stable." 2 THE WITNESS: Yeah. Again, I 3 don't think anybody, having read the 4 safety data sheets that accompanied 5 these tank cars with vinyl chloride, 6 could have come to the conclusion that 7 the vinyl chloride was still stable 8 after going through what it went 9 through for those days. 10 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON: 11 Q. You think that's right? 12 A. I believe anybody, again, 13 looking at the safety data sheet, looking at 14 these emergency response guide, looking at 15 the information from the vinyl chloride, 16 would come to the conclusion that, okay, we 17 can move -- we can move that car. We can -- 18 we want to do something else with this car. 19 I think they looked at the 20 risks associated with what they were being 21 addressed to at that point in time and came 22 to the conclusion, this is the safest action 23 that we can take instead of just letting 24 those cars -- again, if they didn't vent and 25 burn, the op -- the alternative is, what,|Page 349 1 that Norfolk Southern hired to come and help 2 out, right? 3 A. They were a contractor, yes. 4 Q. Right. 5 They're the professionals in 6 dealing with derailments, right? 7 A. They are some of the 8 professionals that were brought in. 9 Q. Okay. "The SRS crews assisted 10 with moving burning hopper cars away from the 11 east end so that the crews could attempt to 12 re-rail VCM Car TILX402025 because the car 13 was determined to be stable with a pressure 14 of 60 PSIG." 15 Did I read that correctly? 16 A. That's what's written here. 17 Q. Okay. So the pros at SRS 18 looked at 402025 and said, that car is 19 stable, we can put it back on the rail and 20 send it on its way. 21 Right? 22 MS. PUJARI: Objection. 23 Mischaracterizes the document. 24 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON: 25 Q. Correct, sir?|
|---|---|


-----

1    A.   No, I don't think they were
2 saying we could put this car back on the
3 rail. Again, there was damage to the bolster
4 assemblies on both sides of the car, as it
5 says here.
6    Q.   Okay. How about this. But for
7 the damage to the bolster, the professionals
8 at SRS were recommending that you take
9 402025, put it back on the rails and send it
10 on its way.
11        Right?
12    A.   I don't take that from reading
13 this paragraph.
14    Q.   Oh, you -- how do you take it
15 then? How do you take that paragraph?
16    A.   I take it -- I take it that the
17 pressure appeared to be stable pressure of
18 60 PSI.
19    Q.   How do you take the attempt to
20 re-rail the car? What does that mean to you?
21        MS. PUJARI: Objection.
22    Mischaracterizes the document.
23        THE WITNESS: When you see
24    "attempt to re-rail the car," where do
25    you see that? I'm looking at the


1    to re-rail the VCM car.
2        It was determined to have a
3    stable pressure of 60 PSI.
4        Again, looking at the context,
5    other than reading that sentence,
6    that's what I take away from that
7    sentence.
8 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:
9    Q.   You take away that -- from that
10 sentence that TILX402025 had the potential to
11 be re-railed?
12        MS. PUJARI: Objection.
13 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:
14    Q.   Given its -- given its pressure
15 readings?
16        MS. PUJARI: Objection.
17    Misstates the document.
18        THE WITNESS: Yeah. From
19    that -- from that sentence, I would
20    say that there was a potential for
21    them to assess whether or not they can
22    re-rail the TILX402025.
23 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:
24    Q.   Right.
25        What happened is that
|Page 351 1 document you referenced and the 2 paragraph -- 3 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON: 4 Q. Can we highlight that or 5 underline it there? I thought it was clear. 6 A. Okay. "Attempt to re-rail the 7 cars." 8 Q. Yeah. Now, I think you 9 testified earlier that the folks at Norfolk 10 Southern and its contractors wouldn't attempt 11 to re-rail a VCM car if it was unsafe. 12 Do you remember that testimony? 13 A. Yes, if it was deemed to be 14 unsafe. 15 Q. Okay. So the folks at SRS, the 16 contractors for Norfolk Southern, had 17 determined that VCM Car TILX402025 was not 18 unsafe and could be re-railed, if possible. 19 True? 20 MS. PUJARI: Objection. 21 Misstates the document. 22 THE WITNESS: I think the 23 statement, the way I read the 24 statement, is that they were sent in 25 from the east to look at the potential|Page 353 1 unfortunately they determined, when they went 2 out to try to re-rail this thing, that the 3 bolster was in such a condition that they 4 couldn't drag it back onto the rails. 5 Right? 6 A. Well, the bolster assemblies, 7 again, I don't think, is the only reason you 8 would not re-rail. Anytime a railway -- a 9 railcar derails, there would be nothing 10 preventing somebody from bringing in 11 additional wheel sets if that was considered 12 to be, again, the safest opportunity at that 13 time. 14 But again, re-railing at that 15 point in time, I guess the context here is 16 what period of time. 17 Q. Well, the context right here is 18 Norfolk Southern wants its rail to get open 19 again. 20 Right? 21 MS. PUJARI: Objection. 22 Misstates the evidence. 23 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON: 24 Q. And if you bring in an extra 25 set of wheels and put those on, that's going|

1 to take time, right?
2        MS. PUJARI: Objection. Form.
3        THE WITNESS: Norfolk Southern
4    was wanting to make sure that the
5    issues that were presented and the
6    safety risks that were prevented were
7    addressed, number one.
8        Obviously, if we re-railed all
9    the cars and had the possibility to
10    re-rail everything and just haul it
11    out, that would be the fastest thing
12    for the cleanup, but that's not the
13    safest course of action.
14        If we could have transferred
15    the product, that would have been the
16    fastest thing. But, again, it wasn't
17    the safest action, and we couldn't
18    take that action.
19        Every time they went through
20    their decision matrix as to figure
21    out, what do we do, they're looking at
22    it from the standpoint of safety.
23 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:
24    Q.   Okay. Well, let me challenge
25 you on that.


1    don't -- I don't take that away from
2    this, I guess, quote from the SRS
3    senior project manager.
4 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:
5    Q.   Okay. Let's look then back at
6 the Exhibit 4, the complaint.
7        I want to focus on
8 paragraph 120.
9        MS. PUJARI: Counsel, 120?
10        MR. SWANSON: Paragraph 120.
11        MS. PUJARI: Thank you.
12 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:
13    Q.   It's on page 24.
14        Are you there?
15    A.   I'm there.
16    Q.   Okay. Paragraph 20 reads,
17 "Here, there were multiple discrepancies
18 identified by the Federal Railroad
19 Administration between the approved documents
20 and the actual physical characteristics of
21 the vinyl fluoride" -- "vinyl chloride tank
22 cars on Train 32N."
23        Do you see that?
24    A.   Yes.
25    Q.   And just as a housekeeping
|Page 355 1 If you look at the testimony of 2 the SRS senior project manager, do you see 3 that right below what we've been reading? 4 Do you see that? 5 He says, "Based on the damage, 6 we're not going to be able to ship this stuff 7 down the road, so we might as well just -- we 8 might as well, based on the risk management 9 scenario, vent and burn all five cars." 10 "Might as well vent and burn." 11 That was the decision, right? 12 A. I'm still reading the quote -- 13 Q. Go ahead. 14 A. -- if you don't mind. 15 So can you repeat the question? 16 I've read the paragraph. 17 Q. The decision to vent and burn 18 TILX402025 wasn't made because that car posed 19 any danger; it was made because they couldn't 20 decide what else to do with it. 21 Right? 22 MS. PUJARI: Objection. 23 Mischaracterizes prior testimony and 24 the document. 25 THE WITNESS: Yeah. Again, I|Page 357 1 matter, Norfolk Southern makes the same 2 allegation in -- or similar allegation in 3 paragraph 152. 4 Correct? 5 A. Similar. 6 Q. Okay. So looking at 7 paragraph 120, it says that these so-called 8 discrepancies were identified by the Federal 9 Railroad Administration. 10 Right? 11 A. Yes. 12 Q. When did the Federal Railroad 13 Administration identify these so-called 14 discrepancies? 15 A. I couldn't -- I couldn't 16 testify here today about when they first 17 identified these discrepancies. I can tell 18 you that I reviewed information during the 19 investigative hearing where the FRA 20 representative, Mr. Kertz {sic}, I guess, 21 testified on his findings comparing the 22 railcars at the derailment to the actual 23 AAR -- AAR Form 4-2, the certificate of 24 construction. 25 Q. Okay. And we'll get to -- it's|
|---|---|


-----

1 Mr. Keltz, I believe, right?
2    A.   I believe that was the FRA
3 representative.
4    Q.   Okay. Other than that analysis
5 by the FRA or Mr. Keltz and any documents
6 they might have created or testimony they
7 gave, did Norfolk Southern do any independent
8 analysis into any discrepancies between the
9 AAR form and the actual car?
10    A.   I'm not aware of any Norfolk
11 Southern employees looking at -- looking at
12 the actual characteristics versus the
13 certificates of construction.
14    Q.   At any time, right?
15    A.   I'm not aware -- again, I'm not
16 aware if it occurred, so it would be anytime,
17 because, again, I'm not aware that it
18 occurred.
19    Q.   Right.
20        And but more focused, certainly
21 between February 3rd, when the train
22 derailed, and February 6th, when the vent and
23 burn was executed, nobody at Norfolk Southern
24 had any information regarding any so-called
25 discrepancies between the AAR Form 4-2 and


1    Q.   Okay. And before Norfolk
2 Southern saw that document or saw that
3 testimony, was anyone at Norfolk Southern
4 aware of the so-called discrepancies between
5 the certificate of construction and Car 26's
6 actual characteristics?
7    A.   I'm not aware of anybody being
8 aware of it.
9    Q.   What were the specific
10 discrepancies that you refer to in
11 subparagraph A?
12    A.   I don't have those down to
13 memory, so if we want to take a look at the
14 investigative hearing transcript -15    Q.   Sure.
16    A.   -- we can go through -- go
17 through that and...
18    Q.   What do you want to look at?
19 You tell me.
20    A.   Okay. Let's go to the
21 investigative hearing transcript, Day 2,
22 pages 630 through 636.
23        (Dixon 30(b)(6) Exhibit 29
24    marked for identification.)

|Page 359 1 the tank car's actual characteristics. 2 Correct? 3 A. Again, I'm not aware of any -- 4 any information that was supplied to NS 5 showing the discrepancies between the actual 6 car characteristics and the certificate of 7 construction during that time. 8 Q. If you look at the 9 subparagraph A in paragraph 120, it says, 10 "Trinity Industries Leasing Company's Car 26 11 has discrepancies between its AAR 4-2 12 certificate of construction and the tank 13 car's actual characteristics." 14 Do you see that? 15 A. I do see that. 16 Q. When did anyone from Norfolk 17 Southern -- well, let me ask it -- let me 18 withdraw that. 19 What evidence do you rely on in 20 making that allegation? 21 A. Looking at information from the 22 NTSB, both the Hazardous Materials Group 23 Chair Factual reports and again the FRA's 24 testimony concerning the investigative 25 hearing.|Page 361 1 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON: 2 Q. Okay. Which page do you want 3 to go to? 4 MS. PUJARI: If he could wait, 5 please. 6 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON: 7 Q. Which page, sir? 8 A. I think it would start at 9 630 -- 10 Q. Sure. 11 A. -- with Mr. Keltz. 12 Q. Okay. Okay. And I just 13 want -- I just want testimony about the 14 Trinity car. 15 Okay? 16 A. Okay. 17 Q. So tell me, what are the 18 specific discrepancies that Norfolk Southern 19 refers to in paragraph 120, subpart A. 20 A. Okay. As you can see, where 21 Mr. Keltz starts there on 630 and he says, 22 down at line 19 there on page 630, starting 23 with "the TILX car." 24 If he said -- if you look at 25 this -- if you look at this document for|

1 TILX402025, you can look down through here
2 and see some discrepancies where when the
3 cars have approvals. These are documented on
4 what's called a certificate of construction.
5 It's an AAR form, industry-recognized AAR
7        He goes on to note, "We looked
8 at the drawings that were provided along with
9 the certificate of construction. We noticed
10 there was issues with the different revision
11 levels that were not captured on the
12 certificates of construction."
13        And then he goes on to state,
14 "So what happened, what happened is, there
15 you have -- you know, it's on this
16 certificate of construction. If it's an
17 original, it is listing an original drawing,
18 and the car is altered subsequently to the
19 approval. And now -- and now it's, as you
20 know -- or as you know, now the information
21 is being provided with a different revision
22 level of drawings. There can be potential
23 changes to the cars that may make them unsafe
24 due to design criteria."
25        So he says, "That's what we


1 part of the car?
2    A.   From here, I'm not sure. From
3 Mr. Keltz's testimony, he doesn't state the
4 exact changes.
5    Q.   Did they relate to valves,
6 wheels, lining, pins, screws? Do you have
7 any idea?
8    A.   Again, just from Mr. Keltz's
9 testimony, I couldn't tell you. But let me
10 take a look and see if we've got anything
11 from the Hazardous Materials Group Chair.
12        MS. PUJARI: I believe it's
13    Exhibit 13.
14        MR. SWANSON: It's Exhibit 13.
15        MS. PUJARI: Do you have the
16    whole -- do you have the entire
17    Exhibit 13, Mr. Dixon?
18        THE WITNESS: Yes.
19 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:
20    Q.   Can you even tell me what part
21 of the tank car these drawings or revisions
22 related to, sir?
23        MS. PUJARI: Objection.
24    Argumentative.
25        THE WITNESS: Again, looking at
|Page 363 1 observed for this particular car. It was the 2 different revisions not captured on the 3 original 4-2 at the time of construction." 4 Q. Got it. 5 As the representative on behalf 6 of Norfolk Southern, is that the sum total of 7 Norfolk Southern's knowledge regarding the 8 so-called discrepancies between Car 26's 4-2 9 certificate and the tank car's actual 10 characteristics? 11 A. I would have to look again at 12 another one of the exhibits, Exhibit 10, the 13 Hazardous Materials Group, pages 33 14 through 38. 15 Q. Okay. You have that one in 16 front of you. 17 So what are the discrepancies 18 that you can tell me about based on this 19 exhibit? 20 A. As the FRA stated, there were 21 different revisions not captured on the 22 original 4-2. That was his summary, from 23 what I read of his testimony. 24 Q. Okay. What did the -- what did 25 the revisions or drawings relate to? What|Page 365 1 the Hazardous Material Group's report, 2 the -- the only other exhibit that I 3 would need to be able to see is to 4 check, again, the revisions that were 5 made. Because I'm assuming here in 6 its application to the AAR for renewal 7 of approval for valves and fittings 8 that were approved on 2019, they 9 referenced pressure relief valves A 10 37,000. And in -- it goes on to 11 describe the parts within the pressure 12 release valve. 13 So I'd have to look at the 14 original 4-2 to see what Mr. Keltz was 15 referring to, but I would assume that 16 some of the revisions that weren't 17 captured, adequately captured. 18 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON: 19 Q. Sir, I don't want your 20 assumption. Okay? Assumption doesn't do 21 anyone any good. I want to know Norfolk 22 Southern's knowledge. 23 You've made an allegation that 24 there were discrepancies between the 4-2 form 25 and the cars that existed. I want you to|
|---|---|

1 tell me, if you can, what those discrepancies
2 were. If you can't tell me, you can say, I
3 don't know.
4        Okay?
5    A.   I'll leave those -- that to the
6 experts to review the 4-2.
7        Again, the FRA noted the
8 differences, or the discrepancies, between
9 the revisions and the original certificate of
10 construction.
11    Q.   Okay. That's one you have to
12 leave to the experts?
13    A.   To look through the
14 construction and the parts on the -- on the
15 tank car, the pressure relief valves, the
16 angle cock valves. I'm not an expert to
17 quickly look at a AAR 4-2 and look at what
18 they stated was in the construction materials
19 and tell you if there is any differences in
20 drawings or anything -21    Q.   We told you two weeks ago we
22 were going to ask you about that. We sent
23 out a notice that said, make sure you can
24 testify about the discrepancies. And now
25 you're saying you got to leave that to the


1 third-party defendants' failure to follow
2 federal regulations and industry rules on the
3 design, build, testing, modification and
4 qualification of hazardous materials tank
5 cars and their components."
6        Did I read that correctly?
7    A.   That's what's written there at
9    Q.   Okay. And that's an allegation
10 that you've made, right?
11    A.   That's an allegation that
12 Norfolk Southern has made, but that is a
13 legal allegation with respect to that
14 paragraph.
15    Q.   Well, let's see.
16        When you say "failure to follow
17 federal regulations and industry rules,"
18 you're referring back to the so-called
19 discrepancies you can't identify.
20        Right?
21        MS. PUJARI: Objection.
22    Misstates prior testimony and calls
23    for a legal conclusion.
24 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:
25    Q.   Correct, sir?
|Page 367 1 experts. You haven't seen the analysis. 2 Is that fair? 3 A. No. What I'm saying is, is I 4 can testify to the fact that I know from what 5 I've read, the FRA has taken exception to the 6 AAR Form 4-2 and what the actual 7 characteristics were on that railcar. 8 Q. Okay. I'm running out of time, 9 so let's turn to paragraph 153, please. 10 "Norfolk Southern alleges the 11 damage and release of hazardous materials 12 from Car 26 was in part the result of 13 Trinity's failure to follow federal 14 regulations and industry rules on the design, 15 build, testing, modification and 16 qualification of hazardous material tank cars 17 and their components." 18 Did I read that right? 19 A. Can you tell me again what 20 paragraph you're on? 21 Q. I'm sorry, I thought you were 22 there. It's paragraph 153. 23 Try it again. "The damage and 24 release of hazardous materials from Cars 26, 25 27, 28, 29 and 53 were in part the result of|Page 369 1 A. I'm saying that's a -- again, 2 part of the federal regulations that are set 3 for the design, building, testing, 4 modification. Those regulations are there, 5 and I would say, again, based off what we saw 6 from the FRA testimony, that there were 7 discrepancies between the actual physical 8 characteristics of the railcars at the time 9 of derailment and the original 4-2 10 certificate of construction. 11 Q. How do you claim that any of 12 those so-called discrepancies caused damage 13 and release of hazardous materials from 14 Car 26? 15 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Calls 16 for a legal conclusion. 17 THE WITNESS: Again, all I'm 18 looking at here from 153 is that it's 19 a -- as it reads -- 20 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON: 21 Q. I can read it. 22 A. Okay. 23 Q. I want to know, how did any 24 discrepancy that you claim existed cause the 25 damage and release of hazardous materials|

1 from Car 26?
2        MS. PUJARI: Objection. Calls
3    for a legal conclusion.
4        THE WITNESS: Every -- again,
5    everybody that is part of the supply
6    chain, whether it's builders,
7    shippers, transportation companies,
8    they all have a responsibility to
9    follow the federal guidelines that are
10    put in place to ensure the safe
11    transportation of goods.
12        If that is not followed,
13    then -- again, the whole purpose of
14    having that in place is to make sure
15    that safety is paramount.
16        The materials, or the damage
17    and releases of hazardous materials
18    from those cars, if responders at this
19    situation at that time, if they're
20    looking at information pertaining to
21    those railcars and making decisions
22    based off those railcars, then, again,
23    they're looking for everybody within
24    the supply chain to have made sure
25    that they're following all federal


1        Correct?
2        MS. PUJARI: Objection.
3    Misstates prior testimony.
4 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:
5    Q.   Correct, sir?
6        What else was it? It was the
7 vent and burn, right?
8    A.   The -9        MS. PUJARI: Objection. Asked
10    and answered. Misstates prior
11    testimony.
12        THE WITNESS: So the release -13    the damage that occurred during the
14    time of the derailment to these cars.
15    Obviously they were all damaged to
16    some extent during the derailment.
17        As far as the release of
18    hazardous materials, all of the
19    chlorine cars, as they were venting,
20    the PRDs were releasing pression -21    releasing pressure, were releasing
22    hazardous materials.
23        So I wouldn't agree with your
24    statement that the only reason you
25    have release of hazardous materials
|Page 371 1 regulations and industry rules. 2 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON: 3 Q. Let me ask it a different way. 4 The release of hazardous 5 materials from Car 26, that was due solely to 6 the vent and burn decision. 7 Right? 8 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Calls 9 for a legal conclusion and misstates 10 prior testimony. 11 You can answer, and then I 12 would ask that we take a break. We've 13 been going for about an hour. 14 MR. SWANSON: All right. I'll 15 finish this line, and then we can take 16 a break. 17 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON: 18 Q. Correct, sir? 19 A. The vent and burn, again, was a 20 decision for all five of these railcars to 21 mitigate the known risks at that time. 22 Q. Right. 23 But when you refer to the 24 release of hazardous materials from Car 26, 25 that was the result of the vent and burn.|Page 373 1 from all these cars is simply the vent 2 and burn. 3 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON: 4 Q. But when the vent and burn 5 decision was made, February 5, 2023, no one 6 at Norfolk Southern was even aware that there 7 were any discrepancies between the AAR 8 Form 4-2 and the Car 26 as it existed at the 9 time. 10 Correct? 11 A. Again, as I testified before, 12 I'm not aware of anybody at Norfolk Southern 13 knowing there was discrepancies between the 14 actual characteristics and the certificate of 15 construction. 16 MR. SWANSON: Okay. We can 17 take a break now. 18 MS. PUJARI: Mr. Swanson, 19 you've been going for an hour. 20 Are you receiving time from 21 someone else? Otherwise, I think your 22 time is up. 23 MR. SWANSON: You can think 24 what you want. We'll take a break, if 25 you want a break, and then we can|

14 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:
15    Q.   Okay. Mr. Dixon, just a few
16 remaining questions on this issue of these
17 so-called discrepancies in the AAR 4-2 forms
18 and how, if at all, they could have caused an
19 injury to Norfolk Southern.
20        You mentioned that these
21 discrepancies were identified by the FRA.
22        Right?
23    A.   Yes, I did.
24    Q.   Okay. And that's the Federal
25 Railroad Administration?


1    Q.   And if you turn in that
2 exhibit, it's -- they're little tiny pages
3 called minu-script pages. I want to turn to
4 page 636, which is in the Bates number that
5 ends 344.
6        Are you there on 636?
7    A.   I am there.
8    Q.   Okay. And as you said,
9 Mr. Keltz had testified about these equipment
10 approval deficiencies that we've been talking
11 about.
12        Right?
13    A.   Yes.
14    Q.   And that's a testimony of his
15 that you read.
16        True?
17    A.   That's true.
18    Q.   Now, Mr. Lynum, one of the
19 folks with NTSB who was asking questions,
20 picked up on this testimony from Mr. Keltz,
21 and he asked him about it. And I want to
22 read from that testimony at 636.
23        Okay?
24        Do you see on line 9 where
25 Mr. Lynum asks Mr. Keltz:
|Page 375 1 A. That's correct. 2 Q. And you referenced some 3 testimony from a Mr. Keltz, who's a 4 representative of the FRA. 5 Right? 6 A. Yes, I did. 7 Q. And you've read his testimony? 8 A. I read a piece of his 9 testimony. 10 Q. Okay. 11 A. Yes, sir. 12 Q. But he's somebody who looked 13 into these discrepancies, and you relied on 14 his testimony in giving your answers. 15 Right? In part? 16 A. In part. And again, reading 17 his testimony was -- yes, that's what 18 occurred. 19 Q. Okay. I want to look at 20 another piece of Mr. Keltz's testimony. This 21 is from Exhibit 29, which is the transcript 22 of investigative hearing, day 2, June 23rd of 23 2023. 24 Okay? 25 A. Okay.|Page 377 1 "Would any of the equipment 2 approval deficiencies you noted lead to 3 tank car safety or performance 4 problems?" 5 Do you see that? 6 A. I see that. 7 Q. And Mr. Keltz testifies: 8 "That, we don't know because, 9 you know, we're not the group that does 10 the approvals. That's -- you know, the 11 approvals are done through the AAR and 12 the tank car committee approval 13 process, and where they use a third 14 party, you know, subject matter expert 15 to do an engineering analysis on those. 16 "So we at FRA, we don't have no 17 way of knowing if there was anything 18 there that would potentially negatively 19 impact these cars as they were in 20 transportation." 21 Did I read that correctly, sir? 22 A. That is what's in the 23 transcript. You read it correctly. 24 Q. So is it your understanding 25 that when the representative of FRA was asked|
|---|---|


-----

1 whether these so-called deficiencies or
2 discrepancies could have affected the safety
3 or performance of the trains, train cars, his
4 response was, we at FRA, we don't know.
5        Right?
6    A.   That was Mr. Keltz's testimony.
7    Q.   What is it that Norfolk
8 Southern knows that the FRA doesn't know when
9 it makes the allegation that these
10 deficiencies or discrepancies somehow caused
11 injury to Norfolk Southern?
12        MS. PUJARI: Objection.
13    Mischaracterizes Mr. Keltz's entire
14    testimony and the complaint.
15        THE WITNESS: Yeah, the -- what
16    I had read was, again, Mr. Kultz -17    Mr. Keltz, FR -- from the FRA, his
18    testimony on the discrepancies noted
19    between the actual characteristics of
20    the tank car and that of on the form
21    AAR 4-2.
22        What you just pointed out here
23    is someone questioning Mr. Keltz on
24    how does that impact the -- what did
25    you say here -
1        My question was pretty simple.
2 Mr. Keltz at the FRA, the guy whose testimony
3 you relied on for your allegation -- for
4 Norfolk Southern's allegation that there were
5 discrepancies between the AAR form and the
6 Car 26, right, Mr. Keltz -7    A.   Yes.
8    Q.   -- he was asked whether any of
9 those discrepancies affected car safety or
10 performance.
11        And his response was, "That, we
12 don't know."
13        Correct?
14        MS. PUJARI: Objection.
15    Mischaracterizes Mr. Keltz's entire
16    testimony.
17        THE WITNESS: Mr. Keltz
18    responds that he doesn't know because,
19    again, he's not the one who is the
20    expert on the actual approvals.
21        What I quoted, again, from the
22    test -- the hearing testimony was
23    Mr. Keltz's review of the actual
24    characteristics of the tank car,
25    comparing it to the certificate of
|Page 379 1 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON: 2 Q. Safety or performance. 3 A. Safety or performance. Tank 4 car safety or performance problems. Lead to. 5 And Mr. Keltz's testimony is, I 6 don't know. 7 Again, the FRA is not 8 responsible for approving the AAR Form 4-2. 9 What they are responsible for is ensuring 10 people are following federal guidelines with 11 respect to -- with respect to all the 12 regulations that go into car construction, 13 maintenance, inspection, the whole nine 14 yards. 15 The FRA, as you probably are 16 well aware, has different -- different areas. 17 They're broken down into operational issues. 18 And obviously Mr. Keltz, on his 19 FRA team, is one of those individuals looking 20 into compliance with respect to, again, 21 making sure that all appropriate changes or 22 revisions in the initial constructions are 23 documented and therefore match the actual 24 characteristics of the railcars. 25 Q. Right.|Page 381 1 construction, or, if there's a 2 revision that's been done, comparing 3 it to the revision to make sure, 4 again, everybody's in compliance with 5 federal regulations. 6 That's -- that was my statement 7 concerning why we noted the NTSB 8 investigative hearing transcripts, not 9 for whether or not the FRA is the 10 individual to make a determination on 11 the impact on safety. 12 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON: 13 Q. If you can turn, please -- 14 thank you, I'm done with -- I'm done with 15 that topic. Just a couple of further topics 16 I want to hit on briefly. 17 Look at Exhibit 4, please. 18 Looking at paragraph 99 -- 19 A. Give me a second. I'm trying 20 to -- 21 Q. I know. You've got a lot of 22 materials. 23 Are you at paragraph 99? 24 A. No, I'm not. 25 Q. No. Page 21.|

1        MS. PUJARI: Counsel -- hold on
2    a sec.
3        MR. SWANSON: What?
4        MS. PUJARI: Withdrawn.
5 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:
6    Q.   Are you there?
7    A.   I'm on page 21, and then can
8 you remind me again of the paragraph?
9    Q.   Yeah, it's the last paragraph
10 there, paragraph 99.
11    A.   Yes, I'm there.
12    Q.   It says, "During the vent and
13 burn, video footage reportedly identified
14 pure polymer, indicating a polymerization
15 reaction releasing from two of the vinyl
16 chloride tank cars."
17        What video is that?
18    A.   I don't know. I'd have to
19 refresh myself on the NTSB investigative
20 hearing, day 1.
21    Q.   Well, have you ever seen the
22 video?
23    A.   Actually, I'm not sure.
24    Q.   Do you know if a video even
25 exists?


1 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:
2    Q.   Are you saying if we look at
3 those exhibits we'll see the video, or we'll
4 see somebody saying, I saw a video?
5    A.   You'll see the video of it.
6 And again, if you go back to the
7 investigative transcripts {sic} hearing,
8 that's where I think we'll get the statements
9 that it was viewed.
10    Q.   I don't want the statements. I
11 want the video. My only question is whether
12 you know if there's a video or not. If you
13 don't, you don't know. That's okay.
14        MS. PUJARI: Objection. Asked
15    and answered.
16        THE WITNESS: As I've stated
17    before, I believe there's a video.
18    It's referenced.
19 QUESTIONS BY MR. SWANSON:
20    Q.   Okay. All right.
21 Paragraph 135. I think this is the last
22 question I'll have. The last topic. It's on
23 page 27.
24        You see there it begins, "Upon
25 information and belief"?
|Page 383 1 A. I would say the video exists, 2 because it's noted. 3 Q. Well, but that -- see, I was a 4 little confused by the way that Norfolk 5 Southern phrased this. 6 It says, "Video footage 7 reportedly identified pure polymer." And I 8 would think if someone had watched that 9 video, you would say, video footage 10 identified pure polymer. 11 That's the reason for my 12 question. 13 Do you know if a video even 14 exists? 15 MS. PUJARI: Objection. Asked 16 and answered. 17 THE WITNESS: Like I said 18 before, if it's noted here, it exists. 19 And if we could take a look at 20 Group B, Exhibit 10, in the NTSB 21 investigative hearing transcripts, I'm 22 sure it'll state just that, that a 23 video was reviewed and reportedly 24 identified pure polymer, indicating a 25 polymerization reaction.|Page 385 1 A. Yes, I see that. 2 Q. Okay. "Upon information and 3 belief, in the aftermath of the derailment 4 and vent and burn, aluminum and copper were 5 found in the vinyl chloride tank cars." 6 Subparagraph A says, 7 "Car 26" -- and that's the Trinity car, 8 right? -- "had aluminum found in samples of 9 the interior surface of the manway nozzle and 10 aluminum coating on the PRD springs." 11 Did I read that right? 12 A. You read that right. 13 Q. Okay. What is -- what 14 documents or evidence do you rely on in 15 making that statement? 16 A. For that I relied on -- or we 17 relied on the Hazardous Materials Group Chair 18 Factual Report. 19 Q. Okay. And is that at pages 28 20 and 62? 21 A. I'd have to look at those pages 22 to see if this is in reference to the Car 26, 23 but... 24 Q. So I'm looking at page 28 of 25 Exhibit 13, the bottom paragraph that you're|
|---|---|


-----

1 referring to?
2    A.   Yes. That's one of the
3 aluminum, 1 to 2.8 percent, was found in four
4 samples collected from TILX402025 interior
5 surface and manway nozzle.
6    Q.   Before this post-derailment
7 tank car sampling analysis was done, did
8 Norfolk Southern know that the PRD spring in
9 Car 402025 had an aluminum -- used an
10 aluminum spring?
11    A.   I would have no way of knowing.
12        MR. SWANSON: Okay. Those are
13    the questions that I have. Thank you,
14    sir. I don't know if anyone else is
15    going to pick up or not.
16        MS. BROZ: How much time is

23       RECROSS-EXAMINATION
24 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:
25    Q.   Mr. Dixon, just one more


1    Q.   Okay. So between February 3rd
2 and February 6th, the day that you vent and
3 burn the cars, was a total three days.
4        Correct?
5    A.   That equates to three days.
6    Q.   So generously, the vent and
7 burn process took a total of three days.
8        Isn't that right?
9    A.   The vent and burn product -10 the vent and burn did not take three days
11 from -- to actually vent and burn.
12        I guess I'm questioning what -13 could you repeat that question with respect
14 to the time you're referring to?
15        When you say "the time it took
16 to vent and burn" -17    Q.   Okay. Let's just cut this
18 short.
19        Is it your testimony that it
20 would have been quicker to transfer the
21 product than to vent and burn the cars?
22        MS. PUJARI: Objection. Asked
23    and answered.
24 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:
25    Q.   Yes or no?
|Page 387 1 question. 2 I believe you testified earlier 3 that transferring the vinyl chloride product 4 would have been faster than the vent and 5 burn? 6 A. The question -- 7 Q. Is that correct? Did you 8 testify to that earlier? 9 A. I testified that if we were 10 looking for just speed to fix the situation, 11 yes, a transfer of product would have been 12 more efficient and sped up everything, rather 13 than a vent and burn. 14 Q. Would it have taken less time? 15 A. It should have, yes. If 16 everything was in good condition, I think 17 that it would have taken less time overall. 18 The actual vent and burn 19 process itself is -- obviously doesn't take a 20 whole a lot of time with respect to comparing 21 that to transferring product. 22 But everything associated with 23 the vent and burn, yeah, the most -- the most 24 efficient piece would have been to transfer 25 the product.|Page 389 1 A. Yes, if you could -- if we 2 could have transferred the product, that 3 means we could have moved and gotten close to 4 those railcars. All of those components 5 would have been in good shape. We would have 6 moved those cars out to an area where we 7 could have just transferred the product to 8 another -- whether it's a truck, a vehicle, 9 whatever it was. But that would have been 10 the fastest thing if we wanted to just get 11 that material that was there out. 12 But that's not -- 13 Q. Can we pull up -- 14 A. -- the case. 15 Q. -- the transcript from day 1? 16 This is from day 1 of the NTSB 17 hearing? If we can go to the bottom of that 18 page. 19 Let's go off. That's not the 20 right page, I think. It's the wrong page 21 number. 22 Can you go to the bottom of 23 that page? 24 A. I don't have a copy of day 1 25 transcript of investigative hearing.|

1    Q.   All right. Since we're short
2 on time, Mr. McCarty testified at day 1 of
3 the -4        MS. PUJARI: I'm sorry, what
5    exhibit is this?
6        MS. BROZ: We haven't marked an
7    exhibit. I'm reading it from the
8    transcript.
9        MS. PUJARI: Okay. We're going
10    to need more context than this. We
11    have this tiny little snippet.
12        MS. BROZ: I'm reading you the
13    context, if you let me continue with
14    my question.
15        MS. PUJARI: Well, we'd like
16    the entire document, please.
17        MS. BROZ: It's day 1 from the
18    NTSB transcript -19        MS. PUJARI: Which we do not
20    have. We do not have that in front of
21    us.
22        So I'm going to object to this
23    because we cannot see what comes
24    before -25        MS. BROZ: That's fine.

2    from approximately four to six hours."
3        Mr. Cassity: Okay. Thank
4    you."
5        Did Norfolk Southern vent and
6 burn these railcars because it was a quicker
7 way and an easier way to get their rails back
8 up in operation instead of actually removing
9 the liquid from the cars, which would have
10 taken an additional five days?
11        MS. PUJARI: Objection. Asked
12    and answered.
13        THE WITNESS: No.
14 QUESTIONS BY MS. BROZ:
15    Q.   Why not?
16        That's all. I'm done.
17        MS. PUJARI: Yeah.

So Mr. McCarty testified: 6 "So extraction, assuming it was 7 still liquid and not polymerizing, it 8 would have taken a long time to do, to 9 inventory five cars, like, days." 10 Mr. Cassity asked: 11 "So for the hot tap, you're 12 saying it would have taken a very long 13 time, correct?" 14 Mr. McCarty says: "Correct." 15 Mr. Cassity said: 16 "So in comparison to the vent 17 and burn, the vent and burn, is it fair 18 to say it was a much quicker process?" 19 Mr. Day responded: 20 "So the vent and burn 21 operation, it takes about three and a 22 half hours to set up once the crew is 23 on screen {sic}.
