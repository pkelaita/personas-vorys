Yes.\nQ.   Great.\nNorfolk Southern responds\nthat it is currently unaware of any employee or\ncontractor who may have been aware, between\nFebruary 3rd and the time of the vent and burn on\nFebruary 6th, that the specific TILX -- specific\ncar, TILX 402025, contained aluminum.\nThat's -- did I read that\ncorrectly?\nA.   Yes, yes.\nQ.   And that's an accurate statement,\nright?",

I don't have a reason to disagree.\nQ.   So it's true that at the time of\nthe vent and burn on February 6th, no Norfolk\nSouthern employee or contractor was aware of any\naluminum in the Trinity car, right?",
  "MS. PUJARI: Objection: form;\nmisstates the document.\nTHE WITNESS: I agree that's\nwhat's stated here.\nBY MS. BENAVIDES:\nQ.

If I did, I did not go into it in 4 detail, if it's in this deck or not. 5 Q. And if you could please turn to 6 Page 15, Interrogatory Number 8. 7 It reads that -- Identify every 8 Norfolk Southern employee or contractor who was 9 aware of any supposed aluminum in TILX 402025 -- 10 And you understand that's what 11 I've been referring to as the \"Trinity car,\" 12 right? 13 A. Yes. 14 Q. Great. 15 -- or any of its components 16 (including the spring on the pressure relief 17 device for TILX 402025) and how and when each 18 such individual became aware of the supposed 19 aluminum. 20 Did I read that correctly? 21 A. Yes. 22 Q. And if you could please look to|Page 237 1 I'd probably rely on the testimony -- or 2 response. 3 BY MS. BENAVIDES: 4 Q. Right -- 5 A. Yeah -- 6 Q. -- you would have -- 7 A. -- yeah. 8 Q. -- you wouldn't disagree with 9 Norfolk Southern's written responses in this 10 case, correct? 11 A. I don't have a reason to disagree. 12 Q. So it's true that at the time of 13 the vent and burn on February 6th, no Norfolk 14 Southern employee or contractor was aware of an 15 aluminum in the Trinity car, right? 16 MS. PUJARI: Objection: form; 17 misstates the document. 18 THE WITNESS: I agree that's 19 what's stated here. 20 BY MS. BENAVIDES: 21 Q. And so you would agree, then, that 22 at the time of the vent and burn, no Norfolk|\nSouthern employee or contractor would be aware of\na specific aluminum-coated spring on the pressure\nrelief device of the Trinity car, right?",
  "MS. PUJARI: Objection: form.\nTHE WITNESS: Yeah. I -- I -- I\nsee nothing to the contrary.\nBY MS. BENAVIDES:\nQ.   Therefore, any coating did not play\nany role in Norfolk Southern's decision-making\nduring its response to the derailment, right?",

  "assumes facts.\nTHE WITNESS: Yeah. I -- I don't\nknow the facts around it.\nBY MS. BENAVIDES:\nQ.   But you did agree that the coating\nplayed no role in Norfolk Southern's response,\nright?",
  "MS. PUJARI: Objection: form.\nTHE WITNESS: Unless there was\nsomeone that we were not aware of that\nknew about it, that's correct.\nBY MS. BENAVIDES:\nQ.   I'm sorry. I don't know if I\nunderstood.\nSomeone that Norfolk Southern\nwas not aware of?\nA.   I believe it says that we -- we\nstate and respond that no one was aware of it,\nbut I don't know for certain that that was\ncomprehensive and accurate. But -21     Q.   You're not certain if Norfolk\nSouthern's responses in this case were accurate?\nPage 239 1 burn? 2 A. I agree that's what it says here. 3 Q. So, therefore, there would not be 4 any way for something that Norfolk Southern 5 didn't know about to have impacted its response 6 to the derailment, correct? 7 A. If we did not know about it, that's 8 correct. 9 Q. And ultimately, the Trinity car was 10 intentionally blown up in a vent and burn 11 operation conducted by Norfolk Southern and its 12 contractors on February 6, right? 13 MS. PUJARI: Objection: form. 14 THE WITNESS: I believe it was 15 part of the vent and burn group of cars. 16 BY MS. BENAVIDES: 17 Q.

I -- I have seen nothing that 9 concretely says that somebody was on the ground 10 and knew about the presence of aluminum for this 11 car. 12 Q. And then if we could -- if you 13 could please put that to the side. 14 And if you can look back to 15 Exhibit 17, which was the NTSB's Group Chair's 16 Factual Report. 17 Do you still have that handy? 18 A. Yes. 19 Q. And if you could please look to 20 Page 34. 21 And let me know when you're 22 there.|\nA.   I'm here.\nQ.   Great.\nThe last sentence of that\nparagraph, which is discussing the equipment\ndetails of the Trinity car, notes that the\nprotective housing cover was fabricated from\ncarbon steel.\nDo you see that?\nA.   I do see that.\nQ.   You have no reason to disagree with\nthe NTSB's finding on that point, right?",
