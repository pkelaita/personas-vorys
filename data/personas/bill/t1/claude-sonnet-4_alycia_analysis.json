  "chunk_0-0": "Focus immediately on defining and pinning down the witness's understanding of \"incremental sales\" versus baseline sales. This is a critical admission that could undermine their damages calculation methodology. Get them to confirm on the record that their analysis may have included sales that would have occurred regardless of any alleged wrongdoing, which directly impacts the causation and damages elements of the case.",
  "chunk_0-1": "Focus immediately on establishing the exact timeline and irrevocable nature of the stock transaction decisions. Specifically, nail down that the March 12, 2012 vesting election form (Exhibit 855) created a binding, irrevocable commitment that preceded the March 27, 2012 actual trade date (Exhibit 854) by 15 days, and that this election was made before any alleged inside information could have influenced the decision. This creates a clear temporal defense showing the trade decision was locked in well before any potentially material information became available.",
  "chunk_0-2": "Focus immediately on pinning down the specific timeframe and circumstances of when the deponent was prohibited from trading. The vague \"I don't recall\" responses about a significant restriction period are suspicious and potentially damaging. \n\n**Next strategic move:** Lock down concrete details with a methodical series of questions: \"Was this restriction within the last 5 years? Within the last 10 years? Was it related to a specific transaction or deal? Did it last weeks, months, or longer?\" Force specificity before allowing any further evasion - this restriction period could be central to establishing pattern or knowledge of trading limitations.",
  "chunk_0-3": "**Next Strategic Move:** Immediately follow up on the witness's apparent agreement that Mr. Wurl's changes did NOT cause the 2012 poor performance. \n\nAsk: \"So what specifically DID cause the poor performance in 2012?\" \n\nThis capitalizes on a critical admission that could eliminate a key defense theory while the witness is in an agreeable pattern, before opposing counsel can rehabilitate or the witness can backtrack.",
  "chunk_0-4": "**Objection to form - compound question.**\n\nThe question improperly combines two distinct inquiries: (1) whether tablets were \"relatively new\" generally, and (2) whether they were \"relatively new to Big Lots specifically.\" These require separate factual foundations and could elicit inconsistent or confused responses.\n\n**Next strategic move:** After the objection is ruled upon, I would prepare follow-up questions to clarify the witness's knowledge foundation about Big Lots' historical tablet inventory and sales experience, ensuring any testimony about \"newness\" is grounded in specific, factual knowledge rather than speculation.",
  "chunk_0-5": "I cannot provide a strategic recommendation based solely on \"MR. LAVELLE: Object to form.\" This excerpt lacks the necessary context - I need to see the question that prompted the objection, the deponent's potential response, and the surrounding testimony to assess what strategic move would be most effective next.\n\nTo provide meaningful strategic guidance, I would need to understand what substantive issue is being explored and how this objection fits into the broader examination."
