  "chunk_0-0": "Based on this brief excerpt, I need to **immediately secure and examine Exhibit 837 in detail** before proceeding with any questioning. \n\nThe witness was discussing incremental sales analysis and testing methodology when interrupted to review this exhibit. Given my approach of knowing documents \"like the back of my hand,\" I would stop all questioning until I can thoroughly review what this exhibit contains, understand how it relates to the witness's testimony about incremental sales measurement, and identify any inconsistencies between the document and the witness's claims about their testing methodology.\n\nOnly after mastering this exhibit's contents can I craft effective follow-up questions that might expose gaps in their analysis or contradictions in their approach to measuring advertising effectiveness.",
  "chunk_0-1": "**Focus immediately on the timing discrepancy between the vesting election form (March 12) and the actual trade (March 27) in relation to when the deponent had access to the positive circular performance data.**\n\nThe deponent has established that multiple circulars in February-March 2012 significantly outperformed prior year results, creating potentially material non-public information. With the vesting election signed March 12 and trade executed March 27, you need to pin down exactly when he knew about these strong performance metrics and whether this influenced his irrevocable vesting decision. This timing issue could be central to any insider trading allegations.",
  "chunk_0-2": "Focus immediately on the documents that would show when and why the trading restriction occurred. Demand production of all trading compliance records, internal communications, and policy documents from that time period. The witness's convenient memory lapses about a significant trading restriction suggest either deliberate evasion or potentially damaging facts - the paper trail will reveal which one and likely contain the smoking gun that explains the true circumstances.",
  "chunk_0-3": "Focus immediately on the stock trading documents and timeline discrepancy. The witness executed a document on 3-12 (Exhibit 855) but stock was sold on 3-27 - explore whether this 15-day gap coincides with any blackout periods, earnings announcements, or material non-public information that would explain the trading restriction mentioned earlier. This timing could reveal insider trading issues or knowledge of undisclosed poor performance before the 2012 results were public.",
  "chunk_0-4": "**Next Strategic Move:** Immediately object to the leading question and then pivot to establish the witness's personal knowledge and involvement in tablet return rate discussions through open-ended questions.\n\nStart with: \"What specific discussions about tablet return rates did you personally participate in during this time period?\" Then follow with: \"What was your role in analyzing or addressing these return rates?\" \n\nThis prevents opposing counsel from continuing to spoon-feed testimony about tablets being \"new\" and forces them to establish foundation through the witness's actual knowledge rather than leading suggestions. The witness has already confirmed discussions occurred - now make them prove what the witness actually knew and did, not what counsel wants them to agree happened.",
  "chunk_0-5": "Looking at this minimal excerpt showing only a form objection, I need more substantive content to provide a meaningful strategic recommendation. \n\nWith only \"Object to form\" available, the most important next step would be to **immediately clarify the specific basis for the form objection and rephrase the question to eliminate any ambiguity**, ensuring the deponent provides substantive testimony rather than allowing opposing counsel to obstruct through procedural objections.\n\nHowever, I need to see the actual question that prompted this objection and the surrounding context to provide the specific tactical approach this situation demands."
