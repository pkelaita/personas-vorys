  "chunk_0-0": "Based on the transcript excerpt provided, I would focus on **defining and quantifying \"incremental sales\" with mathematical precision**. \n\nThe witness has introduced a critical distinction between total sales and \"incremental\" sales (those directly attributable to advertising rather than baseline sales that \"would be there anyway\"). This is likely central to damages calculations or promotional effectiveness claims.\n\nMy next line of questioning would systematically establish:\n1. The specific methodology used to calculate incremental vs. baseline sales\n2. What data systems captured this distinction\n3. Who had access to these calculations and when\n4. Whether this incremental sales data contradicts any damage claims or marketing effectiveness representations made elsewhere\n\nThis aligns with my systematic approach to understanding the underlying data architecture while building toward either corroborating or undermining key financial claims in the case.",
  "chunk_0-1": "Focus immediately on the timing gap between the restricted stock award vesting election form (March 12, 2012) and the actual trade execution (March 27, 2012). This 15-day window is critical - explore what material information the deponent had access to during this period, particularly any sales data, financial results, or internal communications that could have influenced the stock price. The systematic pattern of positive circular performance data being reported throughout February and March 2012 creates a potential timeline of material non-public information that needs to be mapped against the pre-planned stock transaction.",
  "chunk_0-2": "Focus on systematically reconstructing the specific blackout period through document-driven questioning. Ask: \"Let's walk through your employment history year by year and identify when this trading restriction occurred - do you recall if it was during a merger, acquisition, earnings period, or other corporate event? What records would show when you were restricted from trading?\" This leverages the deponent's admission of a restriction while using your systematic approach to uncover the underlying system architecture that would document when and why trading was prohibited.",
  "chunk_0-3": "Focus immediately on the specific nature and timing of the trading restrictions mentioned on page 199. Ask: \"What was your role or access to material information during the periods when you were prohibited from trading?\" This line of questioning could reveal the witness's knowledge of sensitive company information and establish their position as an insider with material knowledge relevant to the performance issues being discussed.",
  "chunk_0-4": "**Next Strategic Move:** Immediately follow up with specific questions about what \"relatively new\" meant to Big Lots operationally - when they first started carrying tablets, what their experience level was with tablet returns compared to other electronics, and whether this newness created any gaps in their return processing procedures or staff training.\n\nThis leverages the witness's admission about tablets being \"relatively new\" to explore whether Big Lots had adequate systems and expertise in place to properly handle tablet returns, potentially exposing operational deficiencies that could support liability or damages arguments.",
  "chunk_0-5": "I need to see the actual deposition transcript excerpts to analyze the situation and provide a strategic recommendation. The only text provided is \"MR. LAVELLE: Object to form.\" - which is just a standard form objection without any context about the question asked, the witness's response, or the surrounding testimony.\n\nTo provide meaningful strategic analysis as Mark Abramowitz, I would need to see:\n- The question that prompted this objection\n- The witness's response (if any)\n- The broader context of the line of questioning\n- What facts or admissions are being sought\n\nPlease provide the relevant transcript excerpts so I can analyze the opposing counsel's strategy and recommend the most important next step."
