This ensures you lock down the witness\u2019s understanding and prevent later ambiguity regarding the data\u2019s interpretation.",
  "chunk_0-1": "Request that the deponent elaborate on the process and timing of receiving internal sales results versus public disclosure, and clarify exactly when material, nonpublic information was known to them relative to the timing of any stock trades\u2014specifically to preempt any implication of insider trading and reinforce their adherence to company protocols.",
  "chunk_0-2": "Immediately clarify and lock in the testimony regarding the witness\u2019s lack of recollection: ask directly, \u201cIs it your testimony, under oath, that you have no memory of any instance where you were told you could not trade stock during an open window, other than the episode you referenced\u2014but that you do not know when or why that occurred?\u201d This nails down their claimed lack of memory and avoids ambiguity or later backtracking.",

  "chunk_0-5": "Ask opposing counsel to state the basis for the objection on the record to clarify any potential ambiguity for the witness, then immediately rephrase the question in a clear, non-leading form to elicit the same information without giving the witness an opening to hedge or change their prior testimony."
