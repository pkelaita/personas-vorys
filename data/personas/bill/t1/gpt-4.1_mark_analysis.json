  "chunk_0-1": "Focus on precisely mapping the **chain of custody and approval process** for all stock trades by the deponent, establishing (1) who from legal and compliance had authority and actual involvement at each approval step, (2) exactly what forms/documentation were generated and where they reside, and (3) whether any communications or system logs exist memorializing the deponent's compliance. Ask the deponent to visually walk through (scene paint) the process for a specific trade (e.g., the March 27, 2012, trade), starting from their decision to trade through notification, approval, documentation, and execution\u2014eliciting granular, sensory, and procedural details at each step.",
  "chunk_0-2": "I would methodically drill down into the **system architecture and procedural triggers** underlying the trading window restrictions:  \n\"Can you walk me through, step-by-step, the process by which you would ordinarily become aware that the trading window was open or closed for you? Who or what system provided that notification, and do you recall any specific communications\u2014email, portal messages, or otherwise\u2014regarding closed windows during your tenure?\"",

  "chunk_0-4": "Focus on clarifying the internal communication channels and who specifically initiated or participated in the discussions about tablet return rates\u2014names, roles, and the formats (emails, meetings, reports). This establishes a roadmap for system architecture: who knew what, when, and how information about return rates moved within Big Lots.",
  "chunk_0-5": "Request that Mr. Lavelle clarify the basis of his objection to form, then calmly re-ask the question using slightly different wording to address any perceived ambiguity\u2014ensuring the question is clear, answerable, and maintains the narrative flow so the witness remains comfortable and forthcoming."
