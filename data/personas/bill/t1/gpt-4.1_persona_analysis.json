  "chunk_0-164": "Clarify and quantify explicitly: \u201cPlease specify the number of years by which you believe Mr. Dukeshire\u2019s life expectancy was reduced, and describe in detail the medical or factual basis for your belief\u2014what sources, records, or opinions are you relying on for that estimate?\u201d",
  "chunk_0-165": "Direct the witness to clarify the medical or factual basis supporting their view on life expectancy\u2014specifically, whether their opinion relies on independent analysis, published life expectancy tables, or specific records regarding the decedent\u2019s health, and to detail all sources underlying the conclusion.",
  "chunk_0-166": "Before allowing further narrowing or potentially impeaching questions on research versus clinical care, I would instruct the deponent (if I\u2019m representing the witness) to clearly and affirmatively delineate their clinical versus research roles: \u201cLet\u2019s clarify the distinction\u2014explain precisely how your medical responsibilities and patient interactions differ (or overlap) in your research role versus your primary care practice, and state whether your research patients are ever under your direct clinical care as treating physician.\u201d This hedges against implied minimization of the witness\u2019s clinical experience with the relevant patient group and preempts any attempt to box the witness into a supposed lack of hands-on clinical involvement."
