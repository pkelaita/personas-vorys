  "chunk_0-2": "For the record, counsel, let me be clear. We reserve the right to take a break at any time, including to confer before a pending question is answered. We will proceed on that basis.",
  "chunk_0-3": "Before the next question is asked, I would take a break to reinforce with my client that this is not a memory test, to listen carefully to the precise question about his conversations with Mr. Marshall, and to not guess or speculate about discussions that happened years ago.",
  "chunk_0-4": "Focus subsequent questioning on establishing that the deponent's understanding of the \"market price\" was formed *entirely* by Mr. Marshall's specific representations about the lack of Ohio infrastructure, reframing the issue from the deponent's failure to investigate to his reasonable reliance on the landman's specialized knowledge.",
  "chunk_0-5": "Call for a brief recess to confer with my client, disrupt opposing counsel's rhythm, and reinforce our strategy privately.",
  "chunk_0-6": "On re-direct, establish what information or whose expertise my client was relying upon for pricing, to demonstrate the reasonableness of them not conducting their own market analysis.",
  "chunk_0-7": "On redirect, I will focus exclusively on the misrepresentation regarding the company\u2019s right to take gas from underneath the property by law. I will have the witness establish that the agent, Mr. Marshall, presented himself as an authority on the subject and explained this was not a possibility but a legal certainty, and that my client, as a layman, reasonably relied on this false statement of law from the company's agent when deciding to sign the lease.",
  "chunk_0-8": "Object on the basis of attorney-client privilege and instruct the witness not to answer any question concerning our discussions.",
  "chunk_0-9": "Re-state the proposition in a simple, affirmative question to eliminate the double-negative ambiguity and lock down the witness's testimony, for example: \"Just so the record is clear, is that statement correct?\"",
  "chunk_0-10": "Instruct the witness: \"Answer based only on what you knew at the time of the events in question, not on what you believe now in hindsight.\"",
  "chunk_0-11": "Object that the question has been asked and answered, and immediately take a break to refocus my client on answering only with facts within their personal knowledge, not argument or speculation.",

  "chunk_0-14": "Instruct the witness not to answer. State the basis for the objection clearly and concisely for the record, then tell opposing counsel to ask his next question.",
  "chunk_0-15": "Instruct the deponent not to answer any question regarding communications with his attorneys, state clearly on the record that the entire subject is protected by the attorney-client privilege, and warn counsel that even confirming the *topic* of legal advice constitutes a waiver.",

  "chunk_0-20": "Go off the record immediately to address counsel's unprofessional conduct and establish proper deposition protocol before continuing.",
  "chunk_0-21": "Instruct the witness not to answer the pending question until counsel rephrases it to provide a proper foundation, as his personal belief in the witness's capability is not a substitute for a well-formed question.",
  "chunk_0-22": "During the next break, coach the deponent to re-frame Marshall's statement about \"expecting activity\" by tying it to any specific facts Marshall provided at the time (e.g., \"He told us to expect it *because* they had already completed surveys/were moving in rigs\"), shifting the focus from an unenforceable promise to a potentially fraudulent misrepresentation of fact.",
  "chunk_0-23": "Object to the form of the question as compound, vague, and assuming facts. Instruct the witness not to adopt counsel's \"fairness\" characterization, but to listen to each part of the question separately if counsel re-asks it properly.",
  "chunk_0-24": "Immediately rephrase the question to eliminate the speculative word \"may,\" asking instead about what actually happened, what the witness recalls, or what a specific document states.",
  "chunk_0-25": "Re-establish that the client's negotiation proposal in Exhibit 4 was based entirely on his conversations with and reliance upon Mr. Marshall's explanation of the option period, not on an independent legal interpretation of the lease, thereby reframing it as the action of a layman rather than a sophisticated party.",
  "chunk_0-26": "On redirect examination, I will focus exclusively on the pre-signing conversations with the landman, Mr. Marshall. I will elicit testimony establishing why his specific representation that Mason Dixon was the drilling company\u2014and not a speculator who would flip the lease\u2014was a material factor that induced my client to sign the agreement, thereby reframing the assignment not as a standard contractual right, but as proof of the original fraud.",
  "chunk_0-27": "On redirect, I will ask: \"To clarify, did your counsel invent a new understanding for you, or did they analyze the contract's language and explain its legal meaning and consequences, which you, as a non-lawyer, had not previously considered?\"",
  "chunk_0-28": "Object on the record that opposing counsel is improperly instructing the witness, and state, \"Counsel, you are not to instruct my witness. Please ask your next question.\""
