  "chunk_0-0": "Given the fourteen exhibits listed in the index and the deponent's stated inexperience, my next move is to immediately and firmly instruct my client to take all the time necessary to read every document presented, in its entirety, before answering a single question about it, thereby controlling the pace and preventing him from being led into an error by a prepared, document-based examination.",
  "chunk_0-1": "I would immediately interject to coach my witness and clarify the record: \"Excuse me. For the record, the witness nodded affirmatively, but I need to instruct him to answer all questions verbally. Sir, could you please answer counsel's last question with a 'yes' or 'no'?\"",
  "chunk_0-2": "Interject immediately to clarify on the record: \"Just so we're clear, while we won't use breaks to improperly coach answers, I absolutely reserve the right to confer with my client after a question is asked but before it is answered to determine if a privilege needs to be asserted or if the question is otherwise improper.\"",
  "chunk_0-3": "My next strategic focus is to ensure the deponent, having established that his sole contact was with Mr. Marshall and that he doesn't recall the specifics of their first interaction, continues to anchor his testimony to the documents. He must consistently state that the emails he reviewed contain his best and most accurate recollection of the negotiations, preventing opposing counsel from creating contradictions by exploiting his decade-old memory.",
  "chunk_0-4": "On the next break, I would prepare the deponent to reframe the issue away from his failure to investigate market prices. He must be ready to clarify that he didn't investigate because he accepted and relied upon Mr. Marshall's specific, factual explanation for the low price\u2014the lie about the lack of infrastructure in Ohio\u2014which he only later discovered was false.",
  "chunk_0-5": "Ask counsel to state the basis for the objection on the record.",
  "chunk_0-6": "Object that the question is argumentative and assumes a duty to investigate that has not been established. I will instruct the witness not to speculate about what they could have done, thereby forcing opposing counsel to first attempt to establish a legal or contractual basis for that duty before proceeding down this line of questioning.",
  "chunk_0-7": "Focus the deponent's entire case on the landman\u2019s representation about the law of unitization (that the company could take the gas regardless of a lease). This is a potentially verifiable misstatement of law, unlike the other claims, which have been exposed as unsupported hearsay that my client failed to investigate.",
  "chunk_0-8": "Object to the question as vague and incomplete, and instruct my witness not to answer until opposing counsel finishes the question and lays the specific factual predicate on the record.",
  "chunk_0-9": "On the record, ask my client to clarify their ambiguous double-negative, stating whether they believe the preceding assertion to be true or false.",
  "chunk_0-10": "On redirect, I will have the witness anchor his \"hindsight\" to a specific document or event with a date, transforming his basis from a vague feeling into a concrete, fact-based timeline of when and how he learned the statement was false.",
  "chunk_0-11": "Object to the question as an improper attempt to exhaust the witness's recollection. Instruct my client that they are not required to list every single basis from memory and to limit their answer to what they recall at this moment, reminding them that their position is based on the totality of the documents and facts, not just what can be recalled under pressure.",
  "chunk_0-12": "Immediately identify the specific document opposing counsel will use to impeach this denial and prepare to neutralize their attack by distinguishing the document's context.",
  "chunk_0-13": "Before the next question, interject to clarify on the record that the witness must carefully consider and testify as to any and all *non-privileged* conversations, ensuring he hasn't inadvertently adopted an inaccurate or incomplete answer.",
  "chunk_0-14": "Stand firm and answer the challenge directly by stating the specific, defensible legal basis for the instruction (e.g., \"attorney-client privilege,\" \"work product doctrine\"). Then, instruct Mr. Kloss to move on to his next question, forcing him to decide whether to escalate the matter with a motion to compel that I am prepared to defend.",
  "chunk_0-15": "Ask the witness to identify every fact or piece of information, completely setting aside any conversations with his attorneys, that forms the basis for his belief that the statement is false.",
  "chunk_0-16": "Call for a break to privately confer with my client, disrupt opposing counsel's momentum, and reinforce our prepared testimony for what is clearly a sensitive line of questioning.",
  "chunk_0-17": "Object to counsel's characterization and demand he clarify on the record precisely what he is asserting was done \"without assistance\" before another question is asked.",
  "chunk_0-18": "Immediately seek to clarify and strictly limit the terms of this commitment on the record, defining \"necessary\" as being determined solely by a formal, written discovery request to which we are legally obligated to respond.",
  "chunk_0-19": "Address my witness directly and state for the record: \"Listen carefully to the question. If you understand it, answer it. If you don't understand it, just say so.\"",
  "chunk_0-20": "Request a brief recess to confer with my client, get him refocused after the lawyer colloquy, and ensure he understands the pending question so he can provide his own complete answer.",
  "chunk_0-21": "Intervene before my client can answer, state that the question calls for speculation and lacks foundation, and take a break to confer with the witness about the basis of his knowledge on this topic.",
  "chunk_0-22": "Take an immediate break. The deponent is systematically destroying his own case by agreeing to every fence-building question posed by opposing counsel\u2014admitting he had no basis for his claims beyond what I told him, that the universe of conversations is closed, and that the other party answered every question he ever asked. I need to get him out of the room to stop the bleeding and reinforce that he must listen to the precise wording of the question and not concede foundational elements of our claim.",
  "chunk_0-23": "Object to the compound question that assumes facts. Then, instruct the witness to address only one piece at a time: first, whether they recall any *other written* guarantees, and only then, if asked, address any separate, non-written discussions.",
  "chunk_0-24": "Advise my client, \"Listen to the question carefully. If it requires you to guess or speculate, state that you can't speculate and can only testify to what you actually recall.\"",
  "chunk_0-25": "During the break, I will prep the witness on the lease's assignment clause. My redirect examination will focus entirely on his testimony that the landman assured him Mason Dixon would be the drilling company, that he was unaware the lease could be assigned, and that he relied on the identity of that specific company when agreeing to the terms.",
  "chunk_0-26": "Instruct the witness not to answer any questions concerning the substance of conversations he had with counsel after retaining him. I will state for the record that counsel is inquiring into privileged attorney-client communications and that we are asserting that privilege to prevent him from further exploring how the legal theories of the case were developed.",
  "chunk_0-27": "On redirect, I would ask my client to confirm that his lawyer did not invent a new theory for him, but rather directed his attention to the specific language in the lease itself, which he had previously overlooked, leading him to a corrected understanding based on the document's actual text.",
  "chunk_0-28": "Go on the record to object to counsel testifying and improperly instructing the witness, and then advise my client to disregard the instruction and answer proper questions truthfully."
