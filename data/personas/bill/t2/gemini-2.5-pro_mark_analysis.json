  "chunk_0-0": "Given the deponent just confirmed he is a novice, I will immediately interject to withdraw our stipulation waiving his right to read and sign the transcript, stating on the record that a first-time witness must be afforded the opportunity to review his testimony for accuracy.",
  "chunk_0-1": "I would interject and instruct my client on the record: \"Ma'am/Sir, I'm sorry to interrupt, but the court reporter can't take down a nod. For the entire deposition, you must answer out loud so she can get a clear record. Please answer the question verbally.\"",
  "chunk_0-2": "Interject to state for the record: \"Just so we're clear, my client can request a break at any time, including after a question is asked and before it is answered, to confer with counsel. Please proceed.\"",
  "chunk_0-3": "Focus on ensuring the client anchors all future answers about his discussions with Mr. Marshall to the e-mails he reviewed, explicitly stating that those documents contain the accurate record, thereby preventing him from being impeached on the specifics of conversations he may not perfectly recall.",
  "chunk_0-4": "Focus the next line of questioning on establishing that the deponent saw no need to investigate market rates precisely because Mr. Marshall's explanation about the lack of Ohio infrastructure seemed credible and definitive, thereby making any such investigation appear futile.",
  "chunk_0-5": "State the specific legal basis for the objection on the record and, if appropriate, instruct my client not to answer.",
  "chunk_0-6": "Focus all subsequent questioning on defining the witness's specific, assigned duties and the standard procedures they were trained to follow, in order to establish that discovering the \"market price\" was outside the scope of their responsibilities.",
  "chunk_0-7": "Pivot from my client's current, hearsay-based knowledge and instead focus questioning on the company agent's misrepresentation of the law. I would elicit the specific, step-by-step process Mr. Marshall claimed allowed the company to \"take the gas anyway,\" establishing that he presented a complex legal procedure (unitization) as an automatic and inevitable right to coerce my client into signing the lease.",
  "chunk_0-8": "Object on the grounds that the question is incomplete and, to the extent it seeks to elicit conversations with counsel, it is protected by the attorney-client privilege, and instruct the witness not to answer.",
  "chunk_0-9": "Instruct the witness to break down the preceding statement counsel is referring to as \"that\" and explain, in their own words, which specific parts they believe are true and which are not.",
  "chunk_0-10": "Object to form, ambiguous as to time. Instruct the witness to answer based only on the information they had at the time of the events, not on what they may have learned in hindsight.",
  "chunk_0-11": "Object on the grounds that the question improperly asks the witness to marshal all evidence and exhaust his recollection, and instruct my client to answer only what he can recall at this moment, explicitly stating that discovery is ongoing.",
  "chunk_0-12": "Call for a break to confer with my client to confirm their understanding of the question and the full implication of their categorical denial.",
  "chunk_0-13": "Interject to object and instruct my client on the record that the attorney-client privilege and work product doctrine protect not just the content of our \"conversations,\" but all aspects of their preparation for this deposition undertaken with my guidance.",

  "chunk_0-22": "Focus questioning on the substance and context of Mr. Marshall's answers, specifically exploring how his statement to \"expect\" activity by a specific date was understood by the deponent and how it influenced the decision to sign the lease, regardless of whether it was a formal \"guarantee.\"",

  "chunk_0-27": "On redirect, I will focus on clarifying the nature of the \"change.\" I will ask the deponent whether counsel *invented* a new position for him, or whether counsel simply reviewed the specific clauses of the pre-existing lease agreement and *explained* the legal meaning of the language he had already signed.",
