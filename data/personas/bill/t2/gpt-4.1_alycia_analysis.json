My next move would be to methodically pin down whether the deponent admits, under oath, that all written documents in their possession before signing\u2014including the emails and addendum\u2014disclosed the actual drilling plan and timelines, and whether the deponent acknowledges that their understanding necessarily came from these writings, not from any promise of drilling on their land during the first five years.
