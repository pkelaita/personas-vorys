  "chunk_0-1": "Clarify on the record that an affirmative nod is not an audible answer and instruct the witness to answer verbally to ensure a clear transcript, thereby eliminating ambiguity and preventing opposing counsel from exploiting any silence or unclear responses later.",
  "chunk_0-2": "Make sure the record is clear by stating: \"Let the record reflect that the witness nodded affirmatively.\" Then, gently remind the witness to give verbal answers to ensure a complete record.",
  "chunk_0-3": "I would focus next on locking down a **precise, chronological account of all communications with Mr. Marshall (and Mason Dixon) prior to the lease signing.** I would methodically walk the deponent through each identified communication, referencing specific documents when possible, to establish exactly what was said, when, and by whom\u2014pressing for details and any supporting documentation or recollections. This will identify any inconsistencies, omissions, or leverage points about disclosures, negotiations, or representations made before executing the lease.",
  "chunk_0-4": "Establish, through documentary evidence, what the actual market rates were in Ohio for similar land in 2008 and whether the deponent could reasonably have relied on Marshall\u2019s representations as to value\u2014then tie the deponent\u2019s actions (or lack thereof) to reasonable reliance or due diligence, to bolster the defense against any claim of reliance on alleged misrepresentations.",
  "chunk_0-5": "Clarify the basis for Mr. Lancione's objection on the record and assess whether the objection signals a sensitive area; then, repeat or rephrase the question to ensure the witness is able to answer fully, protecting the testimony and preserving the issue for the record.",
  "chunk_0-6": "Drill down on **why** the deponent lacked knowledge of the market price\u2014specifically, who was responsible for obtaining or providing that information, what steps (if any) the deponent took to inform themselves, and whether there was any policy, procedure, or expectation about knowing or verifying market price at the relevant time.",
  "chunk_0-7": "I would immediately focus on pinning down *precisely* what representations the witness was told regarding infrastructure, neighboring leases, and pooling/forced integration, and then lock in\u2014with specificity\u2014the basis (or lack thereof) for the witness\u2019s present beliefs about the truth or falsity of those statements. I want a tight record identifying exactly what was said, whether the witness relied on it, and to what tangible or verifiable evidence (if any) he is referencing, with names, dates, and any documents. This includes:\n\n**\u201cLet\u2019s be as specific as possible about what Mr. Marshall said, your understanding at the time, and what, since then, caused you to believe each point was or wasn\u2019t true. Is there anything\u2014documents, conversations, or other sources\u2014you relied on, other than what you\u2019ve mentioned? If not, let\u2019s be clear: your current belief is based only on those unverified conversations, true?\u201d**\n\nThe ultimate goal is to expose unsupported hearsay, lack of diligence, and the absence of a sound factual basis, limiting any later attempt to supplement or backfill with new sources.",
  "chunk_0-8": "Ask the witness to clarify what they understood the question to mean or, if they hesitate, promptly and specifically clarify the ambiguous \"that\"\u2014pinning down exactly what information, instruction, or allegation is being referenced, to avoid confusion and ensure a clear, unequivocal record.",
  "chunk_0-9": "Follow up immediately by asking the witness to clarify what specific aspect they are disputing:  \n\u201cCan you please specify exactly what you believe is false about that statement?\u201d  \nThen, drill down step-by-step using the relevant documents to pin down the facts and expose any inconsistency or lack of support for their denial.",
  "chunk_0-10": "Press the witness to **articulate their reasoning with specificity**, insisting on concrete facts and documents supporting their belief. Ask: \"What specific facts or documents lead you to conclude it is false? Please walk me through your reasoning step by step.\"",

  "chunk_0-13": "Ask the witness: \u201cHave you discussed the subject matter of this litigation with anyone other than your lawyers? If so, with whom, when, and what was discussed?\u201d Then follow up meticulously for details, clarifying whether any documents or communications (emails, notes, texts) relating to those discussions exist.",
  "chunk_0-14": "Press to clarify the scope: \"Counsel, I need a clear answer\u2014are you instructing the witness not to answer questions on this subject, or are you permitting questions on this topic?\"",
  "chunk_0-15": "I would focus next on clearly establishing on the record exactly what factual information\u2014if any\u2014the deponent received from his lawyers that led him to believe the statement was false, without inquiring into the content of legal advice, to demonstrate the factual, not privileged, basis for his belief.",
  "chunk_0-16": "Listen closely to the witness's next answer for any indication that opposing counsel's interjection has influenced or coached the testimony, and be prepared to follow up immediately with a question clarifying whether the witness was answering based on their own memory and knowledge, unaided by counsel\u2019s suggestion.",
  "chunk_0-17": "Listen carefully for any indication that opposing counsel may be improperly coaching or suggesting answers to the witness, and be prepared to make a clear record objecting to any such conduct. Then, ask the witness directly and on the record whether anyone has provided them with suggested answers, talking points, or instructions regarding the subject matter at issue, either prior to or during the deposition, to eliminate any suggestion of improper influence.",
  "chunk_0-18": "Clarify specifically what \u201cassistance\u201d was provided\u2014when, how, and to what extent\u2014by referencing any relevant documents contemporaneous to the alleged assistance. Pin down the details to test for inconsistencies or overstatements that may affect credibility.",
  "chunk_0-19": "Make a clear record: Ask the witness directly if he understood the question and is answering based on his own knowledge, not from anything counsel is suggesting or indicating, to reinforce the integrity of the testimony and deter further improper objections or coaching attempts.",
  "chunk_0-20": "Press opposing counsel, on the record, to clarify and confirm that all answers provided are solely from the deponent and not influenced or supplemented by counsel, and, if necessary, request a break to instruct the witness regarding independent responses.",
  "chunk_0-21": "I would focus next on directly asking Mr. Absalom, \u201cWhat information were you basing that on?\u201d and require him to identify, with specificity, the documents, data, or communications he relied upon. Then, I would follow up by referencing each document in the record that could potentially contradict or undermine his answer, listening carefully for inconsistencies or gaps in his explanation.",
  "chunk_0-22": "Immediately lock down what, if anything, the deponent relied on\u2014outside of the attorney\u2019s statements\u2014for contradicting the key fact, and systematically pin the witness to the fact that the sole basis for their belief is attorney assurance, not direct knowledge or independent investigation. This will set up impeachment or an argument that their testimony on the truth or falsity of the statement lacks foundation.",
  "chunk_0-23": "I would focus next on locking down the absence of any **oral assurances or side agreements** outside the written lease regarding the December 2008 date, to eliminate avenues for the opposing party to later claim unwritten promises. This cements the evidentiary record and closes off potential escape hatches.",
  "chunk_0-24": "Clarify with the witness exactly what, if anything, was meant or understood by the use of \"may\" in the previous question, and nail down whether any action was actually authorized, contemplated, or taken. Pin them to specifics, eliminating ambiguity.",
  "chunk_0-25": "I would focus next on pinning down\u2014document by document\u2014the precise timeline and content of when the deponent received each version of the lease and addenda, and exactly what was reviewed and relied upon before signing, particularly in light of the confusion over option terms and missing sections. This will eliminate ambiguity around what constituted the \u201cfinal\u201d agreement, clarify any gaps in negotiation or disclosure, and allow me to later exploit any inconsistencies or failures in delivery or explanation.",
  "chunk_0-26": "Focus next on pinning down\u2014using the actual language of the lease and bonus agreement\u2014what the deponent\u2019s contemporaneous understanding was at the time of signing regarding (1) the option for a second five-year extension (who could exercise it, whether there was any negotiation or uncertainty about it), and (2) why he accepted the delay rentals without protest for multiple years, only raising concerns after the assignment to Hess. Use the lease\u2019s assignment and renewal provisions to walk through his awareness and intent at each step, and clarify (with reference to documents he acknowledged receiving and cashing) any inconsistencies in his claimed understanding and actual conduct. This both shores up the defense against claims of misrepresentation and highlights any later-invented theories formed only after consulting counsel.",
  "chunk_0-27": "Immediately clarify and firmly assert attorney-client privilege regarding any further questions about the substance of communications or advice from counsel, while succinctly restating that only the timing\u2014not the content\u2014of the change in understanding has been acknowledged. Prepare to object and instruct the witness not to answer if opposing counsel attempts to probe into privileged discussions.",
  "chunk_0-28": "Lock down exactly what\u2014if anything\u2014the deponent has already revealed about discussions with counsel, then pivot immediately to clarifying what information, decisions, or actions were made *outside* the scope of privileged conversations, to isolate facts from advice and prevent improper invocation of privilege going forward."
