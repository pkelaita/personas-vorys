  "chunk_0-0": "Begin with authentic rapport-building questions to put Mr. Absalom at ease\u2014ask about his background, daily routine, or how he prepared for today\u2014so as to foster trust and encourage open, accurate testimony in this unfamiliar setting.",
  "chunk_0-1": "Establish rapport by briefly acknowledging opposing counsel\u2019s ground rules, then pivot immediately to begin asking the deponent about their personal role or perspective\u2014using an open, comfortable question (\u201cLet\u2019s start by having you tell me a little about your responsibilities on X date...\u201d). This sets a tone of authentic engagement and positions you to start \u201cscene painting\u201d while the witness is at ease.",
  "chunk_0-2": "Clarify on the record that the witness\u2019s affirmative nod is being recorded as an agreement and explicitly confirm their understanding verbally, to ensure unambiguous consent and prevent later dispute over whether the ground rule was accepted.",
  "chunk_0-3": "My next strategic move would be to **ask the witness to describe, in granular detail, the earliest memory they have of the interaction or communication that led to being approached about the lease\u2014including where they were, who first contacted whom, what was said, and by what means (phone, in-person, email).** This \u201cscene painting\u201d will both help reconstruct the timeline and potentially expose missing steps, unacknowledged contacts, or inconsistencies in gatekeeping or inducement related to the lease transaction.",
  "chunk_0-4": "I would focus next on methodically pinning down each specific factual misrepresentation or \u201cfalse\u201d statement the deponent recalls Mr. Marshall making during that key meeting: using granular, scene-painting questions to elicit precisely what was said, who said it, in what words, and the context (time, place, tone). I would proceed item by item, separating each alleged representation, and drawing out all accompanying sensory and circumstantial details. This will both clarify the factual record for later comparison to documentary/expert evidence and expose any inconsistencies or corroborative overlaps with other witnesses.",
  "chunk_0-5": "Ask the witness, \u201cDid you understand the question?\u201d and rephrase the previous question in clear, neutral language to ensure an unambiguous record\u2014then proceed with focused follow-up to clarify the underlying facts that prompted the objection.",
  "chunk_0-6": "Clarify precisely **what information regarding market price was accessible to the deponent at the relevant time, through which systems, channels, or personnel, and whether any protocols or tools existed within their organization to check or verify market price**\u2014then methodically trace **who else, if anyone, did have access or was responsible for ensuring knowledge of market price in this transaction.**",
  "chunk_0-7": "My immediate strategic focus would be to methodically establish the **specific representations made by Mr. Marshall regarding \"drilling underneath\" and pooling/unitization**, then elicit whether the witness understood these as *statements of law*, *company policy*, or *mere opinion*\u2014and document whether the witness relied on these representations in making their decision to sign the lease. This includes nailing down verbatim phrasing, context, who was present, and what, if any, follow-up or independent verification the witness undertook, thereby providing a clear record for challenging the accuracy and materiality of these representations in light of relevant statutory or regulatory regimes.",
  "chunk_0-8": "Ask for clarification: \u201cI want to make sure I understand your question\u2014can you clarify 'told you that'? What specifically are you referring to, and in what context?\u201d",
  "chunk_0-9": "Ask the witness to clarify specifically which aspect is false and to explain, in detail and in their own words, what the truth is\u2014prompting them to describe the scene or facts step by step to expose potential inconsistencies or reveal new information.",
  "chunk_0-10": "Ask the witness to clarify, in precise and concrete terms, what specific facts or observations they now know or have learned \"in hindsight\" that lead them to believe the statement is false\u2014pinning them down on the actual evidence or experience informing their belief, rather than speculation or retrospective reasoning.",
  "chunk_0-11": "Ask the deponent: \u201cCan you walk me through, step by step, any conversations, documents, or data you personally relied upon in forming your belief that this statement was false? Let\u2019s focus specifically on what information you had access to\u2014who provided it, where it resided, and when you reviewed it\u2014so we can clarify the foundation for your conclusion.\u201d",
  "chunk_0-12": "I would immediately follow up with: \"Can you help me understand why not?\"\u2014delivered in an open, non-confrontational tone, to encourage the witness to elaborate. This not only fosters trust but also begins to uncover the 'system architecture' behind their negative answer, exposing rationale, process gaps, or potential inconsistencies.",
  "chunk_0-13": "Ask the witness: \u201cCan you describe, in as much detail as possible, every conversation you had regarding this incident, excluding anything discussed with your lawyers? Who was present, what was said, and when did these conversations take place?\u201d",
  "chunk_0-14": "I would clarify the record by calmly stating, \"Counsel, could you please specify exactly what area or document you wish to inquire into, and for what purpose? I want to ensure we\u2019re operating within the agreed scope, but if there\u2019s a foundation for your question, let\u2019s make it explicit for the record before my client responds.\"",
  "chunk_0-15": "Clarify on the record the precise scope of the privilege being asserted: Ask Mr. Lancione to identify specifically whether any facts communicated to or from counsel are being withheld, and to distinguish between protected legal advice and underlying factual information, ensuring the witness answers all permissible factual questions about the basis for his beliefs or any facts learned, regardless of lawyer conversations.",
  "chunk_0-16": "Request a clarification from the witness\u2014gently but firmly\u2014regarding any prior interruption: \u201cJust to clarify, before counsel interjected, you were about to say something in response to my last question. Please go ahead and finish your answer.\u201d This ensures the witness\u2019s full narrative is on the record and signals that you will protect their space to testify truthfully and completely.",
  "chunk_0-17": "Ask the witness to clarify in granular detail the circumstances under which they would or would not provide assistance, using \"scene painting\" to establish specifically what they observed, what cues led them to act (or not act), and who else was present, to lock down the factual boundaries of their involvement.",
  "chunk_0-18": "My next step is to clarify and detail what specific circumstances the witness considers \"necessary\" for providing assistance\u2014by eliciting concrete examples and criteria, I can both expose potential inconsistencies and precisely map out the witness\u2019s decision-making process for later factual or credibility analysis.",
  "chunk_0-19": "Request a clear statement on the record delineating who is testifying, then directly ask the deponent, in your calm, co-pilot style: \u201cLet\u2019s clarify\u2014are you answering based on your own personal knowledge, or are you relying on information provided by someone else?\u201d This both re-centers control with the witness and preserves the authentic fact-finding tone.",
  "chunk_0-20": "Request the court reporter to mark for the record the interruption and improper coaching attempt by opposing counsel, and then calmly re-establish direct communication with the witness by restating: \"Let's continue\u2014I'm interested in hearing the information directly from you, in your own words, without any assistance from counsel.\"",
  "chunk_0-21": "I would focus next on reaffirming Mr. Absalom\u2019s independent knowledge base: \"Mr. Absalom, can you describe in your own words exactly what information you relied upon and how you accessed it, without reference to anyone else\u2019s input or interpretation?\"",
  "chunk_0-22": "Politely but firmly place on the record that you are entitled to make objections as to form but should refrain from coaching or making speaking objections that suggest answers. Then, as soon as the question is answered, immediately follow up with a targeted, open-ended question to your client: \u201cCould you clarify, in your own words, exactly what Mr. Marshall told you regarding the timing of activity on your property, and what your understanding was about any guarantees or expectations?\u201d This both neutralizes the objection\u2019s effect and methodically pins down the facts in a way that is insulated from coaching or reinterpretation.",
  "chunk_0-23": "I would focus on clarifying the system and process by which lease terms\u2014including guarantees\u2014are documented, communicated, and tracked, asking:  \n\"Can you walk me through, step-by-step, how any guarantees or amendments to your lease\u2014whether written or verbal\u2014would normally be created, documented, and conveyed to you? Who would be involved in that process, and where would that documentation ultimately reside?\"",
  "chunk_0-24": "Request that opposing counsel clarify and state the specific basis for their objection on the record, then calmly reframe the question to eliminate ambiguity regarding \"may\"\u2014substituting it with precise, fact-based language that anchors the witness to actual knowledge or actions, ensuring the record is clear and defensible.",
  "chunk_0-25": "I would focus next on pinning down *exactly how and when the deponent received critical lease documents*\u2014specifically the original lease and addenda\u2014by referencing the metadata: email headers, cover letters, and any file names or timestamps. I would methodically ask the deponent to trace, step-by-step, their recollection of receiving, opening, printing, and reviewing each document, and to identify any possible gaps, including whether any document or attachment is missing from their files or memory. This would clarify the document flow for later arguments about notice, reliance, or the completeness of disclosures, and expose any inconsistencies the opposing counsel might exploit regarding what was actually reviewed before signing.",
  "chunk_0-26": "Assert the witness's subjective understanding and intent at the time of contracting\u2014specifically, clarify in granular detail what representations (if any) were made to the witness by the landman (Mr. Marshall) or Mason Dixon regarding assignability, duration, and delay rental rights, and document any expectations, promises, or written statements the witness relied upon before execution. This line best leverages the system architecture of both the negotiation and the executed documents to establish the witness\u2019s state of mind and potential misrepresentation, while \u201cpainting the scene\u201d of the formation process for later corroboration or impeachment.",
  "chunk_0-27": "I would immediately focus on clarifying the **timeline and the precise facts or communications that triggered the change in understanding**, anchoring the sequence of events around any written records, emails, meeting notes, or other documentation. My next step:\n\n\"Let\u2019s walk through exactly when you first contacted legal counsel and what prompted you to seek their review\u2014what specific events, communications, or documents made you decide to reach out at that time?\"",
  "chunk_0-28": "Clarify on the record that the witness will not disclose privileged communications, and ask the witness to specify, for the clarity of the transcript, what topics or subject matter (without revealing content) were discussed with counsel\u2014framing the question to delineate the boundary of privilege, ensuring no inadvertent waiver, and identifying the general areas covered in preparation, to assess the scope of any potential privilege disputes."
