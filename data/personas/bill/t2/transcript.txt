     7 BY MR. KLOSS:

```
8 Q.
###### �[Can you state your full name for the record, ]
```
     9 please.
    10 A. Edmund Walter Absalom.
  �

```
11 Q. `Mr. Absalom, have you had your deposition`
###### �
```
    12 taken before?
     13 A. No.
  �

```
`14` Q. `The ground rules are pretty simple. Let me`
###### �
```
    15 finish my question, and I -- and then I’ll try to let
    16 you finish your answer. Even though sometimes in a
    17 conversation we may know what each other is going to

```
18 `say, she’s trying to take down everything we say. So`
```
    19 if we talk at the same time, her fingers will get all
     20 tangled up, and then she’ll get mad at us.
     21 If I ask you a question that doesn’t make
    22 sense, it’s not intentional. It will probably happen,
    23 but I’m not doing it on purpose. Please let me know
    24 if that happens, and I’ll try to rephrase it so it

```

-----

```
                                           Page 6
     1 does make sense. And the same thing, if I ask you
     2 something that you don’t hear, let me repeat -- or
     3 tell me that, and I’ll repeat it.
      4 Is that all right?
 �
     5 A. (Nodding affirmatively.)
  �

```
`6` Q. `And contrary to popular belief, it’s not an`
###### �
```
     7 endurance test, so if you want to take a break, you
     8 can take a break. Just let me know. I usually take a
     9 break about an hour -- every hour or so. All I ask is
    10 that if there’s a question pending, that you answer
     11 it, and then we can go. Okay?
     �
     12 A. (Nodding affirmatively.)

```
`13` Q. `And last` `rule is shaking your head doesn’t`
```
    14 work. I’m going to need your answers out loud.
     15 A. (Nodding affirmatively.)
  �
     16 Q. "Yes" or "No" is better than a "Uh-huh" or an
  �
    17 "Huh-uh." Because sometimes it’s hard for her to tell
    18 the difference. All right?
    I 19 A. Yes.
  �

```
`20` Q. `Okay. What’s your current home address?`

     3 A. He told me it looked like a standard lease, as

     4 far as he could tell, but that he wasn’t familiar with
     5 anything involving gas and oil. And he didn’t make

  �
     8 and gas lease; correct?
     9 A. Yeah.
  �
    10 Q. He didn’t -- he didn’t make any

    18 Mr. McKeen?

  �
     21 A. Just upon -- when I contacted him with it, he
  �
    22 said he’d look at it. And the conversation we had,
    23 which I’ve already told you, was -- that was the
    24 extent of our contact.

```

`Page 14` I
```
     1 Q. Okay. So you contacted him, and you somehow

     2 got him a copy of the lease?
      3 A. (Nodding affirmatively.)

    � �
     10 told you it looked like a standard oil and gas lease?
###### Ill A. Yeah. But that he wasn’t familiar with oil

    112 and gas.
    13 Q. Okay. How many discussions do you think you
  �
    14 had -- actual face-to-face discussions, do you think
    15 you had with Mr. Marshall prior to signing the
    16 lease?
    17 A. I can’t remember for sure. There was two that

    18 I can remember.
     19 Q. And then you had a number of e-mails;

     12 and knock on your door, or how did that happen?

     19 A. Not very long. I would assume maybe less than
    �
     20 an hour.

```
`21` Q. `Okay.`
```
     22 A. I don’t think it was very long.

    19 remember what I can recall. Okay?

```
`20` Q. `Okay. That’s all I’m asking.`
###### �
```
    21 A. I don’t remember a lot, but I remember details
  �
    22 that came into play later after all of these things
    23 transpired --
    24 Q. Okay.

                                          Page 17
     1 A. -- which leads to the reason why we’re sitting
  �
     2 here.
     3 Q. Let’s just get to it. What do you recall
  �
     4 about the meeting?
     5 A. Okay. I remember him telling me, when I
  �
     6 questioned him on certain things, the answers to
     7 certain questions. I remember him talking -- offering
     8 what they were offering, $100.00 an acre or 12.5.
     9 Okay? I remember asking him at one point why then is
    10 it that -- why then is it that across the river
    11 property values are high- -- that, you know, they’re
    12 higher? The lease rentals are higher.
     13 He informed me that it was because that Ohio
 �
    14 has no infrastructure -- or piping infrastructure.
    15 That Cameron was already an established gas facility.
    16 And because of that, the oil and gas companies were
    17 attracted to that side of the river, because the cost
    18 of development in Ohio was going to be so expensive,
    19 it wasn’t feasible for them to develop. It was too
     20 expensive.
     21 Q. Okay. Let me stop you there.
  �
     22 Let’s -- let’s talk about this first point,
 �
    23 and then we’ll cover the next point. The offering
    24 price you discussed was $100.00 per acre; is that

```
     1 right?
     2 A. Yes.
  �

```
`3` Q. `And that was the ultimate price agreed upon;`
###### �
```
     4 true?
     5 A. True.
  �
     6 Q. Okay. Did you make any investigation as to
  �
     7 what the rates were in Ohio on land similarly situated
     8 to yours in 2008?
     9A. No.
  �

```
10 Q. `Okay. Do you have any evidence to suggest`
###### �
```
    11 that the going rate in Ohio for land similarly
    12 situated at the time, in 2008, when your lease was
    13 structured that there were prices -- higher prices
    14 being given?
     15 A. No.
  �

```
`16` Q. `Okay. So as far as you know, for land`
###### �
```
    17 similar- -- similarly situated in Ohio in 2008, being
    18 similarly situated to your land, that was about the
    19 market price as far as you -- you were aware?
     20 MR. LANCIONE: Objection.
 �

```
`21` Q. (By `Mr. Kloss) You can go ahead and answer.`
###### �
```
     22 A. I did not know what the market price was.
  �

```
`23` Q. `You had no knowledge that it wasn’t the market`

```
    24 price? Would that be fair?

```

```
                                          Page 19
     1 A. I had no knowledge of the market price.
 �

```
`2` Q. `Okay. Nothing prevented you from`
###### �
```
     3 investigating that? Would that be true?
     4 A. Nothing; true.
 �

```
`5` Q. `All right. And you -- you were aware,`
###### �
```
     6 however, apparently, that across the river, presumably
     7 in West Virginia -- that’s what you’re referring to?
     8 A. (Nodding affirmatively.)
 �

```
`9` Q.
```
    I 10 A. Yes.
 �

```
11 Q. `You believed that the prices were higher?`
###### �
```
    12 A. Yes.
  �

```
`13` Q. `How were you` `aware` `of that?`
```
     14 A. Conversations from guys at work and the news
    I 15 media.

```
`16` Q. `And what was your understanding of the West`
###### �
```
    17 Virginia prices at that time in 2008, if you know?
     18 A. About $2,500 an acre.
  �

```
`19` Q. `Okay. And the explanation given to you was`
###### �
```
    20 that in West Virginia there was infrastructure,
    21 pipeline, ex cetera to transport the gas or oil; true?
     22 A. True.
  �

```
`23` Q. `Okay. And the explanation given to you was in`
###### �
```
    24 Ohio at this point in 2008 that infrastructure was not

```

-----

```
                                          Page 20
     1 as developed. That it wasn’t developed like it was in
     2 West Virginia; is that correct?
     3 A. He said there was no infrastructure.
 �

```
`4` Q. `Okay. And do you believe that was untrue in`
###### �
```
    6A. I do now.
 �

```
7 Q.
###### �[Okay. Tell me what the basis is that you ]
```
     8 believe that was untrue when it was told to you in
    10 A. Only -- only based on -- on what I’ve been
 �
    11 told by other people that there is -- there are
    12 existing gas lines that run in southern Ohio.

```
`13` Q. `Okay. Existing -- and who told you that?`
###### �
```
    14 A. Friends.
 �

```
15 Q. `What are their names?`
###### �
```
    16 A. Acquaintances.
  �

```
17 `Q.` `What are their names?`
```
  �
    18 A. It’s just con- -- conversation at work.
  �
    19 really couldn’t pinpoint names.
    20 Q. Well, who are the friends or acquaintances who
  �
    21 told you that were there -- there was some form of
    122 infra- -- infrastructure in 2008 that leads you to
    23 conclude that what you were told in 2008 was untrue?
     24 A. One of the fellow’s name was Mark Baker.

     1 Q. Okay. Who else?
 �
     2 A. That’s it that I can remember.
 �
     3 Q. Is Mr. Baker one of your friends that you work
 �
     4 with?
     5 A. Yeah.
 �
     6 Q. Does Mr. Baker still work with you?
 �
     7 A. Yes.
 �
     8 Q. Where does Mr. Baker live?
 �
     9 A. He lives in Moundsville somewhere. I do not
 �
    10 know where.
    11 Q. Do you know if Mr. Baker has signed any type
 �
    12 of oil and gas lease?
    13 A. No, I don’t know.
  �
    14 Q. Did you ever do any independent investigation
  �
    15 on your own to determine whether or not Mr. Baker was
    16 -- his information was accurate?
    17 A. No.
  �
    18 Q. So as you sit here today, other than what
  �
    19 Mr. Baker told you, you have no knowledge as to what
    20 the status of the oil and gas pipeline and
    21 transportation services were in Ohio in 2008; true?
    22 A. True.
  �
    23 Q. Okay. What else? That’s -- I think that’s
  �
    24 the first issue you covered with Mr. Marshall.

```
                                         Page 221
      1 What else do you recall during the first
 �
     2 meeting that you discussed with Mr. Marshall?
     3 A. Okay. Coming out of that about the pipe and
 �
     4 the infrastructure --

```
5 Q.
###### �[Yes, sir. ]
```
     6 A. -- the costs of development, it’s very
  �
     7 expensive, and that’s why it’s not attractive.
      8 The other thing he told me during the course
 �
     9 of our conversations was that -- he had told me that
    10 my neighbor, Mr. Kalirick, George Kalirick, had signed
    11 with Mason Dixon, and that several of my neighbors
    12 had, although he didn’t mention any other name other
    13 than Kalirick.

```
14 Q. `Kalirick, how do you spell that?`
###### �

15 `A.` `I do not know.`
```
  �
     16 MR. LANCIONE: I think it’s
 �
    17 K-a-l-l-r-i-c-- --
     18 MS. LLOYD: -- -k.
 �
     19 MR. KLOSS: Okay. It’s not Kalarick;
 �
    20 it’s Kalirick?
     21 A. Probably.
  �

```
`22` Q. `(By Mr. Kioss) All right. And do you`
###### �
```
    23 believe that to be untrue?
     24 A. I didn’t until last year. I was talking to a
  �

```

-----

```
                                          Page 23
     1 friend of mine. You can ask her name. Margie Koontz.
     2 She was told -- she told me that she was in a group of
     3 people that were in discussions with a lawyer from
     4 Bridgeport, Ohio, who were going in as a group to
     5 lease their property.
      6 And she told me that George Kalirick was -- I
 �
     7 believe his name is George. Mr. Kalirick was
     �
     8 included as part of that. That led me to believe that
     9 Mr. Kallrick didn’t sign with Mason Dixon.

```
10 Q. `Okay. But you’ve not had a conversation with`
###### �
```
    11 Mr. Kalirick to determine whether that’s true or
    12 false?
    13 A. No.
  �

```
`14` Q. `Would that be fair?`
###### �
```
     15 A. Yes.
  �

```
`16` Q. `And have you done any independent research to`
###### �
```
    17 determine whether that’s true or false? Whether you
    18 go through a property search or anything like that?
     19 A. I have not.
  �

```
`20` Q. `Okay.`
###### �
```
     21 All right. So we had the first issue or
 �
    22 issues about the prices and the cost of development
    23 of the facilities. And then the second issue is
    24 Mr. Kalirick had signed with Mason Dixon.

```

`Page 24` I
```
      1 What else do you recall about your first
 �
     2 conversation before you signed the lease?
     3 A. During the course of our conversations he also
  �
     4 told my -- me, and I believe that he told my Uncle Tom
     5 Absalom the same thing, because I do remember Tom
     6 telling me that they -- that we could expect that they
     7 would be putting a well on the property on 647, or
     8 possibly on Tom Absalom’s property above mine by
     9 December of 2008.
     10 Q. By Sept- -- December 2008, so within, call it,
  �
    11 a month or so of your signing?
     12 A. Yes. That they were going to be coming into
  �
    13 that area, and look to be seeing a well. That those
    14 were going to be potential spots where they were going
    15 to be putting a well, and to expect to see some
    16 activity by December of 2008.
     17 Q. Okay. Tom Absalom is your uncle; is that
  �
    18 right? Is that what you said?
     19 A. Yes. Yeah. He’s actually, I think, a second
  �
    20 cousin.
     21 Q. Okay.
  �
     22 A. He’s like my dad’s cousin.
  �
     23 Q. Your dad’s cousin?
  �
     24 A. I’m not exactly sure. He’s always been my

                                         Page 25
     1 Uncle Tom.
     2 Q. Got you. And -- and where is his proper- --
 �
     3 property located in connection to yours?
     4 A. His property adjoins my property on the south
 �
     5 side.
     6 Q. And do you have any estimate as to how large a
 �
     7 property your Uncle Tom has in acres?
     8 A. I believe its roughly 80.
 �
     9 Q. Okay. All right. What else do you recall
 �
    10 about your first conversation with Mr. Marshall?
    11 A. During the course of our conversations, he
 �
    12 also told me that, concerning the gas and oil leases,
    13 that the initial lease is not the part to concern
    114 yourself with as far as money is concerned. That the
    15 royalty payments is where the money is to be made.
     16 He also said that concerning the landowner,
 �
    17 that the drilling company had the right to drill
    18 underneath to take the gas from underneath my
    19 property, if I held out, and did not sign a lease. He
    20 said it really didn’t matter. That they could -- if
    21 they owned all the property around me, that they could
    22 come underneath me and take the gas as long as they
    23 paid the minimum requirement of 12.5 percent royalties
    24 to me.

```

-----

```
                                         Page 261
      1 And he said, so by not signing the lease, that
 �
     2 if they did -- if they drilled in my area, that they
     3 could take the gas anyway. So that all I would be
     4 missing -- I would be missing out on the initial lease
     5 money and would be receiving royalty payments anyway.
     6 Q. Okay. Let’s break those into two parts.
 �
     7 A. Okay.
 �
     8 Q. I’d like that. I like to work in bite-sized
  �
     9 pieces. The first part of that is that he indicated
    10 to you that the -- where the -- the biggest financial
    11 interest was, was the loyalty payments, if gas or oil
    12 was produced, as opposed to the bonus payments or
    13 rental payments that are made in association with the
    14 lease itself?
    15 A. Right.
  �
    16 Q. Any reason to believe that’s not true?
  �
    17 A. Do I have a reason to believe that’s not true?
  �
    18 Q. Yes.
  �
    19 A. I believe that it could potentially be true.
  �
    20 Q. Okay. So you don’t know whether it’s true or
  �
    21 false; fair?
    I 22 A. Fair.
  �
    123 Q. And then the other issue is that there existed
  �
    124 a possibility that, even if you did not sign a lease,

```

-----

```
                                         Page 271
     1 that oil or gas wells were drilled around you, that
     2 the oil or gas could be taken?
      3 MR. LANCIONE: I’m going to object to
 �
     4 the phrasing of the question. He didn’t state a
     5 "possibility." He was told that’s what would happen.
      6 MR. KLOSS: Okay. Right. That’s fair
 �
     7 enough.
     8 A. And he said that. He explained that to me,
  �
     9 being that one or two landowners -- the reason it’s
    10 set up that way -- of course he was telling me that
    11 was by law, and that was so that one or two landowners
    12 can’t halt production for all the other existing
    13 landowners and for the drilling company itself.

```
`14` Q. `(By Mr. Kioss) Has anybody told you that`
###### �
```
    15 that’s false?
     16 A. No.
  �

```
`17` Q. `Do you believe that to be true?`
###### �
```
     18 A. No.
  �

```
`19` Q. `Okay. You think -- so you think it is false.`
###### �
```
    20 Upon what basis do you think it is false?
     21 A. Because if -- on that basis now in hindsight,
  �
    22 if it was a false statement, then why would any -- why
    23 would companies offer what they do to lease property,
    24 if all they had to do was lease a couple of lands, and

```

```
                                         Page 281
     1 then come in and just drill under and take the minimum
     2 required by law and give it to the landowners?
      3 Q. Okay. Fair enough.
  �
 �
      4 Any other basis upon which you believe that is
 �
     5 false?
     6A. No.
  �
      7 MR. LANCIONE: Well, other than the
 �
     8 conversations with your lawyers.
      9 THE WITNESS: Right.
 �
     10 MR. KLOSS: Well, are you going to let
 �
    11 me inquire into that?
     12 MR. LANCIONE: No. You can ask him if
 �
    13 -- I mean, you can -- to the point that he’s had
    14 conversations with his lawyers that have told him it’s
    15 false, but I don’t think you could go into the detail
    16 of the discussions but.
     17 MR. KLOSS: With -- with all due
 �
    18 respect, I appreciate your -- your assistance, and I’m
    19 certain that it’s designed to make sure we get all the
    20 truth, but let’s let him testify --
     21 MR. LANCIONE: Sure.

     22 MR. KLOSS: -- and without your
 �
    23 assistance. All right?

     1 necessary for me to assist him, I will.
      2 MR. KLOSS: You’re going to -- you’re
 �
     3 going to intercede and testify for him? I can --
      4 MR. LANCIONE: No.

      5 MR. KLOSS: -- put you under oath, too,
 �
     6 if you want me to.
      7 MR. LANCIONE: I am not going to
 �
     8 testify for him, and I wasn’t testifying. I was
     9 trying to help him get all the information that he --
     10 MR. KLOSS: Okay.
 �
     11 MR. LANCIONE: -- was basing that on.
 �
     12 MR. KLOSS: I -- I think Mr. Absalom is
 �
    13 capable of giving me the information. If he misses
    14 something, we’ll deal with it. But I would appreciate
    15 it if you would not coach the witness in the middle of
    16 a question.

```
`17` Q. `(By Mr. Kioss) All right. The other basis,`
###### �
```
    18 apparently, is your lawyer has told you that’s false.
    19 Is that true?
     20 A. Yes, I asked.
  �

`21` Q. `And your lawyer being whom?`
###### �
```
     22 A. Mr. Richard Lancione.

    24 believe that statement to be false?

     1A. No.
      2 Q. All right. Any other topics you’ve talked
    �
      3 about with Mr. Marshall prior to signing the lease?
      4 A. Not that I can remember at this time.
      5 Q. Okay. Did you talk with Tom, your Uncle Tom,

      6 prior to signing the lease?

     11 that you did?

    �

```
`17` Q. `How about indirectly?`
```
     18 A. No.

```
`19` Q. `Okay.`
```
     20 A. Well, I’m assuming he did --
    �

```
`21` Q. `Okay.`
```
     22 A. -- because at one time he inquired about not
     23 receiving a lease payment. And I think that that’s in
     �
     24 the paperwork that you were given.

```

-----

`Page 31` I
```
     1 Q. Okay. I think I know what you’re talking
 �
     2 about, and we’ll -- we’ll go through the paperwork in
     3 a second.
      4 Tell me what you discussed with Tom about the
 �
     5 lease prior to signing the lease that you can recall.
     6 A. Oh, I asked -- we had discussions. He -- I --
 �
     7 being that he’s older than me, I kind of seeked some
     8 advise from him on it. He told me that he was talking
     9 to some friends of his, some business fellows that
    10 were also contacted and concerned and that. And they
    11 weren’t sure whether they were going to do it. But he
    12 told me -- you know, we talked.
     13 And I asked -- I asked him if he thought we --
 �
    14 if I thought we could do a -- come up with a better
    115 lease. And he said that he wasn’t sure, but that I
     16 could ask if I wanted to.
     17 Q. Okay. And I think you did, didn’t you?
        �
     18 A. Yes, I did.

      1 A. No, we didn’t talk too much about it.
    �
      2 Q. I take it in the family, in the family
       �
      3 confines, this -- this falls under the stuff you deal
   �
      4 with?
      5 A. Yes.
      6 Q. Okay.
      7 MR. KLOSS: I don’t mean any offense.
     �
      8 MRS. ABSALOM: No. No, I have my

     10 MR. KLOSS: Fair enough.

`11` `MRS. ABSALOM:` -- `and he has his.`

     �
     12 MR. KLOSS: Got it. All right. And
     ���
     13 we’ll -- we’ll talk to you shortly, but I didn’t want
     14 to create any -

`16` `MR.` `KLOSS:` -- `any problems there.`

     17 Q. (By Mr. Kioss) Well, is it fair to say that,
    ��
     18 as far as taking a look at this oil and gas lease and
     19 negotiating it, the ultimate decision to do it within
     20 your family, your family perimeter, that was -- that
     21 was you that did that as opposed to Mrs. Absalom?
     22 A. Yes.
     23 Q. Okay. Fair enough.
     24 All right. So we have Mr. -- you -- anything

     1 prior to signing the lease?
     2 A. As far as I can recall.
  �
     3 Q. All right. Now, when you first met with
  �
     4 Mr. Marshall, did he give you any documents, such as
     5 the lease itself?
     6 A. Not that I can remember.
  �
     7 Q. When was the first time you saw the lease
  �
     8 itself? Because I know you said you had -- you
     9 believe you had a couple of conversations, and I think
    10 we’ve kind of lumped them together. So let me -- let
    11 me ask it this way. Let me -- let me start with a
    12 fresh question.
     13 The first time you met with Mr. Marshall, do
 �
    14 you believe he gave you a copy of the lease to look
    15 at?
     16 A. I don’t remember.
  �

```
`17` Q. `Okay. Sometime` `prior to signing the lease,`

```
    18 obviously, you were given a copy; true?
     19 A. E-mailed, but I’m not for sure.
  �

```
`20` Q. `Okay. And you asked -- and we’ll cover the`

```
    21 e-mails. You asked Mr. Marshall a number of questions
    22 with regard to the lease?

     2 answer?
    3A. No.
 �

```
`4` Q. `Okay.`
###### �
```
     5 A. Not that -- not that I’m aware of. I can’t

     6 remember him not answering.

```
7 Q.
###### �[Now, you were told -- you said you were told ]
```
     8 that he thought there would be activity up by your
     9 property potentially in -- as the -- as early as 2000-
    10 -- December of 2008; true?
    I 11 A. Yes.
  �

```
`112` Q. `He didn’t guarantee that, though, did he?`
###### �
```
    113 A. He said to expect it; we could expect to see
  �
    I 14 it.

```
`15` Q. `Okay.` `But he` `didn’t guarantee` `it,` `and it`
```
     16 didn’t appear -- any term like that isn’t in your

```
117 `lease, is it?`
```
    118 MR. LANCIONE: I object to the
 �
    19 question.

`20` Q. `(By Mr. Kioss) Go ahead and answer.`
###### �
```
     21 A. There’s nothing like that, that I’m aware of,
  �
    22 in my lease.

    24 occur in December of 2008, he didn’t provide any type

     1 of other written guarantee or any other type of
     2 guarantee saying it would occur by December 2008.
      3 Would that be fair?
 �
      4 MR. LANCIONE: I object to the form of
 �
     5 the question, and the fact of the use of the word
     6 "May."
      7 You can answer, if you can.
 �
     8 A. Will you repeat the question --
  �

```
9 Q. `Sure.`

```
    �
    10 A. -- please?
  �

```
11 Q. `When somebody says "may," that may -- that`
###### �
```
    12 means it might occur or it might not?
     13 Would that be fair?
 �
     14 A. That would be fair.
  �

```
`15` Q. `And the term he used was May?`
###### �
```
     16 A. No, "expect."
  �

```
`17` Q. `Expect. All right. But what he didn’t use --`
###### �
```
    18 the term he didn’t use was any type of absolute

```
19 `certainty or guarantee that it would occur by December`
```
    20 of 2008; fair?
     21 MR. LANCIONE: Object.
 �
     22 A. I have no -- he didn’t offer a guarantee.
  �

```
`23` Q. `(By Mr. Kloss) He did not?`

```
     24 A. No.

`Page 37` I
1 Q.
###### �[Okay. ]
```
     2 A. I took him at his word --

     7 only person you talked with representing the oil

`16` Q. (By `Mr. Kioss) Why don’t you take a look at`

```
    17 Exhibit No. 1 there, if you can. The first page of
    18 Exhibit 1 is a -- it kind of looks like three e-mails.

     2 Q. Do you believe you received any other

     3 documents with this e-mail other than these two?
    4A. No.

     5 Q. All right.

     6 A. Not that I am aware of.
  �
     7 Q. Did you bring your documents with you today

     8 that you referred to earlier?
     9 A. Yeah, these (indicating)
  �
    10 Q. Those are the ones that you already

    11 transmitted to me.
    12 A. Yes.
  �
     13 Q. All right. So the addendum, did you -- did
  �
    14 you read that?
     15 A. To the best of my ability.

     16 Q. Okay. And the Mason Dixon Energy information,
  �
    17 did you read that?
     18 A. Yes.
  �
     19 Q. Okay. And -- and it talked about in the
  �
    20 bottom paragraph on the first page, the plan is to
    21 drill -- drill two evaluation wells in 2008, and if
    22 successful, 10 to 15 wells in 2009, 20 to 25 wells in
    23 2010, and incremental increases in the years to come.

     1 proximity to previously drilled successful wells; and
     2 No. 2, the amount of surrounding participating leased
     3 acreage available for additional development; right?
     4 A. Right.
 �
     5 Q. And then it says on the next page At the
 �
     6 present time the first two well- -- wells have been
     7 drilled in Section 20 of the Cross Creek Township and
     8 Section 3 of Wayne Township; correct?
     9 A. Yes.
 �
    10 Q. All right. So the information that he
 �
    11 provided to you said the plan is to drill two
    12 evaluation wells in 2008, and then it identified two
    13 wells that had been drilled; right?
     14 A. Yes.
  �
     15 Q. And it also says on the second page, "Actual
  �
    16 production won’t begin for approximately one month
    17 because pipeline right of ways must be secured and a
    18 pipeline built approximately seven miles to connect
    19 with an existing line capable of handling future
    20 volumes from multiple wells.
     21 "The absence of pipelines in Belmont and
 �
    22 Jefferson County, compounded by low oil and gas prices
    23 in the past, are the principal reasons that the area
    24 has generated little interest until now."

```
                                          Page 42
      1 This is consistent with what Mr. Marshall told
 �
     2 you, at least as it relates to the access to
     3 pipelines, is it not?
     4 A. It seems to be.
  �
     5 Q. Okay. Any reason to believe this is untrue?
  �
     6 A. Not this part of it.
  �
     7 Q. Okay. And going back to the prior page, it --
  �
     8 it talked about the wells that were drilled in 2008;
     9 two evaluation wells; correct? That seems
    110 inconsistent with the -- your recollection that he
    11 told you that there would be activity on your property
    12 in 2008; true?
     13 A. Would you read -- go over that again, please?
          �
     14 Q. Sure. On the last paragraph of the first
    15 page, and going onto the first paragraphs -- paragraph
    16 of the second page, it says, "The plan is to drill two
    17 evaluation wells in 2008, and if successful, 10 to 15
    18 wells in 2009," et cetera.
     19 A. Uh-huh.
  �
     20 Q. On the next page it says, "At the present time
  �
    21 the first two wells have been drilled in Section 20 of
    22 Cross Creek Township and Section 3 of Wayne Township."
    123 Those first two wells weren’t on your
 �
    124 property; true?

```

```
                                          Page 43
     1 A. True.
 �
     2 Q. And the fact that it says two wells are going
 �
     3 to be drilled and two wells have been drilled, that’s
     4 inconsistent with what you told me Mr. Marshall told
     5 you.
     6 A. What is inconsistent?
  �
     7 Q. It says two -- two wells were going to be
  �
     8 drilled in 2008, and at the present time the first two
     9 wells have been drilled.
     10 A. Okay. And if successful.
  �
     11 Q. 10 to 15 wells in 2009.
  �
     12 A. Right.
  �
     13 Q. It says nothing about drilling any more wells
  �
    14 in 2008, does it?
     15 A. It doesn’t seem to.
  �
    116 Q. Okay. And you had this documentation, this
  �
    117 written documentation, from Mason Dixon before you
    118 signed the lease; correct?
    119 A. Correct.
  �
     20 Q. And you reviewed it before you signed the
  �
    21 lease, to the best of your ability; true?
     22 A. To the best of my ability.
  �
     23 Q. All right.
     24 A. One other thing that makes -- that this brings

```

```
                                         Page 441
     1 to mind is what Mr. Mason [sic] told me.
     2 Q. Okay.
 �
     3 A. I asked him if Mason Dixon Energy was the
 �
     4 drilling company and would be the one who was
     5 actually drilling on my property or on the pool that I
     6 would be in. And he assured me that Mason Dixon --
     7 and of course, this says Marquette Exploration -- was
     8 the joint company and would be doing the drilling.
     9 Q. Okay.
 �
    10 A. And it says here the office will be maintained
 �
    11 throughout the drilling and development phases.

```
`12` Q. `Okay. Are you aware in the lease that there`
###### �
```
    13 is an ability for the rights and obligations under the
    14 lease to be transferred --
    15 A. No.
  �

```
`16` Q. `-- to other drilling companies?`
###### �
```
    17 A. No.
  �

```
18 Q. `Okay. We’ll cover that in a moment.`
###### �
```
     19 All right. Did you reply -- we saw you
 �
    20 replied to these e-mails saying you got -- you got his
    21 inquiry.

    23 this.

 �
     4 Q. (By Mr. Kloss) Before we go on to Exhibit 2,
 �
     5 let me ask you a couple -- one more question with
     6 regard to Exhibit 1.
      7 The last -- the -- his last e-mail to you, the
 �
     8 one that appears on the top says, "Please review the
     9 attached addendum. This document will become part of
    10 the lease. The lease itself will remain as written."
     11 At this point in time, did you have a copy of
 �
    12 the lease in your possession?
    13 A. If not in my possession, probably in e-mail
  �
    14 form.
     15 Q. Okay. So you believe you received it at or
  �
    16 around this time period; the lease itself?
     17 A. I do believe so.
  �
     18 Q. Because I was unable to find any e-mail of the
  �
    19 original lease. So my question is did -- did he give
    20 it to you? How did you get it? Do you recall?
     21 A. I do -- you know, he did -- I think he did
  �
    22 either mail it to me --
     23 Q. Okay.
  �
     24 A. -- or give me a -- a lease.

     1 lease, or this was things that we talked about that --

```
`2` Q. `Okay.`
###### �
```
     3 A. -- came from that.
  �

```
`4` Q. `So what is clear is that, before you signed`
###### �
```
     5 the lease, you had an opportunity -- you had the copy
     6 of the lease, and you had an opportunity to review it?
     7 And the same thing is true with regards to the
     8 addendum before you eventually signed them? You had a
     9 copy of it, and you had an opportunity to review it?
     10 A. Yes.
  �

```
11 Q. `All right.`
###### �
```
     12 All right. Let’s move on to Exhibit 2. This
 �
    113 looks like a two mail -- two e-mail exchange; correct?
    I 14 A. Yes.
  �

```
`15` Q. `The first one is an e-mail from you to`
###### �
```
    16 Mr. Marshall, dated October 9, 2008 at 8:14 p.m. It
    17 says, "John, I was wondering if the people in the pool
    18 are responsible for any portion of the maintenance
    19 cost of wells and any pipelines that might be taken
    20 out of the royalties before or after production
    121 starts"; correct?
    I 22 A. Yes.
  �

```
`23` Q. `And then he answered you at the top, and he`
###### �
```
    24 provided an addendum. I don’t think we need to read

```

-----

```
     1 that whole thing, but the addendum language there,
     2 which is bolded, makes it clear that there is no
     3 deduction from royalty for costs associated with
     4 gathering, compression, or marketing the gas produced
     5 and sold from the lands covered under the lease;
     6 correct? I’m paraphrasing a bit, but I’m just trying
     7 to --
     8 A. Yes.
  �
     9 Q. -- speed things up.
  �
    10 A. Yes.
  �
    11 Q. Okay. Did that answer your question
  �
    12 satisfactorily?
     13 A. Yes.
  �
     14 Q. Okay.
  �
     15 A. I believe that was made part of the addendum.
  �
     16 Q. Okay. And if you look, attached to the -- to
  �
    17 the e-mail is another copy of the addendum; correct?
     18 A. Yes.
  �
     19 Q. And if you look down at the bottom, there’s
  �
    20 some bolded language, if you will. Do you see that on
    21 the second paragraph --
     22 A. Yes.
  �
     23 Q. -- from the bottom?
  �
     24 A. Yes.

1 Q.
###### �["Lessee shall make no deduction to lessor’s ]
```
     2 royalty for lessee’s operating costs for gathering,
     3 compression and marketing gas produced and sold from
     4 lands covered hereunder"; correct?
     5 A. Yes.
 �

```
6 Q.
###### �[So ] [he answered your question and said No, ]
```
     7 there weren’t going to be any costs. And that
     8 language was admitted into the addendum and included
     9 in the addendum that he transmitted to you; fair?
    10 A. Fair.
 �

```
11 Q. `All right. Now, at this point what was your`
###### �
```
    12 understanding as to the length of the term of the
    13 lease that you were discussing?
    14 A. Five years.
  �

```
`15` Q. `Okay. A five-year initial term, and there was`
###### �

16 `also an option period?`
```
    17 A. I guess. My understanding of the option
  �
    18 period was that after -- that after the five years,
    19 they would agree to pay me 500 an acre or something
    20 like that in the sixth year in order to renew --

```
`21` Q. `Okay.`
###### �
```
    22 A. -- the lease.
  �

```
`23` Q. `Fair enough. Let’s talk about what you`
###### �
```
    24 understood, and then we’ll get to the lease.

```

-----

```
                                         Page 501
     1 A. All right.
 �
     2 Q. But during this time period, what was your
  �
     3 understanding? You understood it was supposed to be a
     4 five-year initial term. Were you supposed to be given
     5 any type of payment up-front?
      6 Was that the $100.00 you referred to?
 �
     7 A. Yeah, whatever was agreed to in our bonus
  �
     8 rental agreement.
     9 Q. Okay. So for signing the lease you got a
  �
    10 bonus; right? Is that your understanding?
    11 A. I got the agree- -- the rental agreement,
  �
    12 yeah.
     13 Q. Okay.
  �
     14 A. Per acre, I guess.
  �
     15 Q. And then what did you receive on a yearly
  �
    16 basis? What did you understand you were going to
    17 receive on a yearly basis during that first five-year
    18 period?
     19 A. What was agreed upon on a yearly basis was
  �
    20 $100.00 an acre.
     21 Q. Okay. That’s sometimes referred to as the
  �
    22 delayed rental?
     23 A. (Nodding affirmatively.)
  �
     24 Q. Yes, sir?
  �

```

-----

`Page 51` I
```
     1 A. Yes.
 �
     2 Q. And your understanding is the delay rental is
 �
     3 rental that’s paid if there’s no drilling activity on
     4 your property; correct?
     5 A. Yes.
 �
     6 Q. Okay. So your understanding of the lease that
 �
     7 you signed was you were going to get an initial
     8 payment up-front, the bonus payment; right?
     9 A. There was no up-front payment.
 �
    10 Q. Well, you were going to get a payment after --
 �
    11 after the lease was signed as a bonus payment?
    12 A. I was going to get a yearly payment.
  �
    13 Q. Okay. And each year that there was no
  �
    14 drilling activity during the first five-year period
    15 you were going to get the delay rental of $100.00 per
    16 acre; true?
    17 A. $100.00 per acre was the said amount.
  �
     18 Q. Okay. For each year during the first five
  �
    19 years; correct?
    20 A. For each year that we were in a contract; yes.
  �
    21 Q. Okay. And then, if no drilling activity had
  �
    22 happened during the first five years, the primary or
    23 the initial term of the contract, you were provided to
    24 be paid another bonus of $500.00 per acre a year?

```

-----

`Page 52` I
```
     1 A. Yes.
  �
     2 Q. Okay. And then that extended for another
  �
     3 five-year period the lease?
     4 A. That would extend the lease.
  �
     5 Q. Okay. And were you still, if that instance
  �
     6 occurred or if that occurred, the option to exercise,
     7 in addition to the $500.00 per acre bonus payment for
     8 each year, if there was no drill activity, you would
     9 receive $100.00 per acre per year; true?
     10 A. True.
  �
     11 Q. Okay. And that was your understanding of the
  �
    12 agreement you reached with Mason Dixon in October of
    13 2008; true?
     14 A. Not necessarily. There seems to -- there
  �
    15 appears to be a misunderstanding on my part, because
    16 -- or somebody, you know, what I told, whatever.
     17 But I thought that after five years, they
 �
    18 agreed to $500.00 an acre. If I didn’t accept that,
    19 then the lease was done.
     20 Q. Okay. We’ll -- we’ll get into the option
  �
    21 period.
     22 A. That’s why the $500.00 bonus was trying -- was
  �
    23 -- you know, was to -- to offer -- to make an offer to
    24 me to resign again.

                                         Page 531
     1 Q. Okay. Well, let me -- let’s break it down
 �
     2 into two pieces.
     3 A. Okay.
 �
     4 Q. The initial or the primary term, let’s just
 �
     5 talk about that first.
     6 A. Yes.
 �
     7 Q. Your understanding was that that was five
  �
     8 years; true?
     9 A. Five-year lease.
  �
    10.Q. Okay. And there was an initial payment, after
  �
    11 the lease was signed, of $100.00 per acre; correct?
    I 12 A. Yes.
  �
    13 Q. And if nothing was drilled after the first
  �
    14 year, you would receive another $100.00 per acre;
    15 correct?
    I 16 A. Yes.
  �
     17 Q. And if nothing was drilled after the second
  �
    18 year, you would receive another $100.00 an acre; true?
     19 A. Yes.
  �
     20 Q. The third year you’d receive another 100- --
  �
    21 $100.00 an acre if no drilling had commenced; true?
     22 A. Yes.
  �
     23 Q. Fourth year you’d receive another $100.00 per
  �
    24 acre if no drilling was commenced; true?

`2` Q. `And in the fifth year, same deal; $100.00 per`

`5` Q. `That was your understanding about the initial`

     6 or primary terms for the first five-year period of the

```
9 Q.
###### �[Okay. And then after the first period, you ]
```
    10 were -- you understood you were supposed to then
    11 receive $500.00 per acre?

```
`13` Q.
```
     14 A. Yes.
  �

```
`15` Q. `And after you received the $500.00 per acre,`

```
    16 that that would extend another -- it would extend the
    17 option period another five -- at least another five
    18 years?

  �

```
`20` Q. `Okay.`

     21 A. -- after -- with $500.00 an acre.

    24 the --

`Page 55` I

     1 Q. Okay.
 �
     2 A. -- sixth-year payment.
 �

```
`3` Q. `Fair enough.`
###### �
```
     4 A. And not continue the lease.
 �

```
`5` Q. `All right. The initial -- given that the`
###### �
```
     6 initial term was five years, the lease was signed in
     7 October of 2008?
     8 A. Yes.
 �

```
9 Q.
###### �[The initial five-year period of the lease went ]
```
    10 into October of 2013?
    11 A. Yes.
  �

```
`12` Q. `All right. So there’s no lack of clarity in`
###### �
```
    13 your mind as to the primary term, but perhaps a lack
    14 of clarity in your mind as to the option term; is that
    15 fair?
    16 A. Fair.
  �

```
`17` Q. `And -- strike that.`
###### �
```
     18 Let’s go back to Exhibit No. 2. We’ve talked
 �
    19 about that he answered your question satisfactorily.
     20 Is there any other -- do you believe you had
 �
    21 any other communications with him on this issue? Or
    22 at this point of the lease regarding discussions with
    23 Mr. Marshall, are we now just talking to him by
    24 e-mail? I’m just trying to see if we’re missing any

```
                                         Page 561
     1 oral conversations?
     2 A. We’re talking about e-mail mostly now.
 �

```
`3` Q. `Okay. Fair enough.`
###### �
```
     4 A. Most of these e-mails I have, when they
 �
     5 started, that’s when we were discussing things by
     6 e-mail.

```
7 Q. `Fair enough.`
###### �
```
 �
      9 (ABSALOM Deposition Exhibit
 �
    10 No. 3 marked for purposes of identification.)
 � �

```
`12` Q. (By `Mr. Kioss) All right. I’m handing you`
###### �
```
    13 Exhibit 3. This is an e-mail dated October 12th, 2008
    14 on the bottom; correct?
    15 A. Yes.
  �
     16 Q. It’s from you, October 12,000 -- 12th, 2008 at
  �

```
17 `9:20 p.m. from you to Mr. Marshall; correct?`
```
    18 A. Yes.
  �
    19 Q. And then the top half of it is Mr. Marshall’s
  �
    20 response to your e-mail; correct?
    21 A. Yes.
  �

```
`22` Q. `All right. The question says "This should be`
###### �
```
    23 my last question." And then you ask a -- I don’t
    24 think we need to go through this in great detail, but

```

-----

```
                                          Page 57
     1 you ask about the property description that occurs in
     2 Section 1 of the lease; right?
     3 A. Yes.
  �
     4 Q. And you asked what certain language in there
  �
     5 meant. The language says, "In addition to the above
     6 described land, this lease also covers accretions and
     7 strips or parcels of land now or hereafter owned by
     8 lessor which are contiguous or adjacent to the above
     9 described land, including any interest therein, which
    10 the lessor may hereafter acquire by reversion,
    11 prescription, or otherwise"; right?
     12 A. Yes.
  �
     13 Q. So the gist of your question is, Hey, if I get
  �
    14 -- get additional land in the future, will it be
    15 subject to this lease?
     16 Is that a fair paraphrase?
 �
     17 A. Yes.
  �
     18 Q. And what tripped that is the language that I
  �
    19 just quoted. That raised the question in your mind as
    20 to what effect that would have on land you acquire in
    21 the future; is that fair?
     22 A. Yes.
  �
     23 Q. And Mr. Marshall responded and told you what
  �
    24 that language meant, and that it didn’t -- it didn’t

```

```
                                        Page 581
     1 necessarily apply to property that you got -- you get
     2 in the fut- -- that you acquired in the future. Okay?
      3 Is that a fair paraphrase of what he said when
 �
     4 he described the meaning of the language?
     5 A. Could you repeat that, please?
 �
     6 Q. Sure. That was a pretty sloppy question. I
 �
     7 apologize. Mr. Marshall answered your question, did
     8 he not?
     9 A. With this e-mail, yes.
 �
    10 Q. Okay. Did he answer it to your satisfaction?
 �
    11 A. At the time, yes.
 �
    12 Q. Okay.
 �
     13 All right. Now, the oil and gas -- this is
 �
    14 the first time we’ve seen a copy of an oil and gas
    15 lease attached --
    16 A. He’s --
 �
    17 Q. Or strike that.
 �
     18 What?
 �
    19 A. To what hers saying here, from my
  �
    20 understanding here is -- no, this does not -- this
    21 lease does not come into play as to any other property
    22 that I acquire.
    23 Q. Yes. Yes. Paraphrasing, that’s right. I
  �
    24 agree with you. And attached to this e-mail is an oil

                                         Page 591
     1 and gas lease. This is the first copy of an oil and
     2 gas lease that came in the documents you produced?
     3 A. (Nodding affirmatively.)
  �
     4 Q. Do you believe you had this prior to the
  �
     5 e-mail?
     6 A. I don’t know that this -- this was attached to
  �
     7 the e-mail.

```
8 Q.
###### �[Fair enough. Do you have your documents ]
```
     9 there? You could look through to verify if it was or
    10 it was not; right?
    11 A. I don’t know how this was put together.
  �

```
`12` Q. `Okay.`
###### �
```
     13 A. So no, I -- I don’t know if this was attached
  �
    14 to the e-mail. This is a copy of -- this is a copy of
    15 an agreement that I seen before.

```
`16` Q. `Okay.`
###### �
```
     17 A. Because it’s missing Section 5.
  �

```
18 Q. `You’re right, it is.`
###### �
```
     19 A. So I have seen that before.
  �

```
`20` Q. `Well, let -- let me ask this. I can short cut`
###### �
```
    21 this.
     22 The bottom line is, when you sent your e-mail
 �
    23 on October 12th, would you agree with me that you’re
    24 asking him a pretty specific question with regard to

```

-----

```
                                         Page 601
     1 the terms of the lease?
     2 A. Yes.
 �

```
`3` Q. `Okay. Given that, would you agree with me`
###### �
```
     4 that certainly by October 12, 2008, because we weren’t
     5 able to locate it before, you had a copy of a proposed
     6 lease at that point that you were reviewing; true?
     7 A. Yes.
 �

```
`8` Q. `Okay.` `That’s` `all` `I want to` `establish by`
```
  �
   �
     9 that. And whether or not what was attached to this,
    10 you’re not certain if this is the lease that you were
    11 referring to?
    12 A. No, I’m not sure and -- no, I’m not -- yes,
 �
    13 I’m not. Because this e-mail doesn’t seem to say that
    14 there’s an attachment.

```
`15` Q. `Okay.`
###### �
```
     16 A. So where this -- in this form that it’s in
  �
    17 right now, I don’t know who attached this on here.

```
18 Q. `Okay. But you’re not disputing this is a true`
###### �
```
    19 and accurate copy of the e-mail exchange that you had
    120 with him?

```
I `[21 A. ]` `Right.`
```
  �

```
`22` Q. `Okay. Fair enough. Fair enough.`

                                         Page 621
     1 Q. The first one is from you, dated October 13,
  �
     2 2008, 8:09 p.m. to Mr. Marshall again; correct?
     3 A. Correct.
  �
     4 Q. It says, "John: Thank you for answering my
  �
     5 questions. In reply to your question, please do add
     6 my wife to the lease agreement."
      7 And then it says, "I am satisfied with the
 �
     8 bulk of the agreement. My proposal to you is I would
     9 like to leave the lease in the format that we have
    10 been discussing with the attached addendum and changes
    11 made to the lease for myself and for Tom, including
    12 the sixth year $500.00 per acre amount.
     13 "However, the annual per acre amount, I would
 �
    14 like to increase to $140.00 per acre every five years,
    15 and thereafter, 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th. This figure
    16 would better suit my personal plans for the rental
    17 income of my property during the rental period,
    18 whatever that may be. I have been discussing this
    19 with Tom, and if this proposal is acceptable, we will
    20 agree to sign with Mason Dixon Energy.
     21 "Thank you for your consideration."
 �
     22 Okay. This is talking about the option period
 �
    23 of the lease, is it not? That’s the second five-year
    24 period?

```

-----

```
                                          Page 63
     1 A. Yeah.
 �
     2 Q. Okay. And what you’re proposing here is that,
 �
     3 under the option period, you get the $500.00 per acre
     4 payment; correct?
     5 A. Yes.
  �
     6 Q. And then every year thereafter, the delay
  �
     7 payment would go up from $100.00 to $140.00 per acre;
     8 correct?
     9 A. Yes.
  �
     10 Q. Okay. There’s no mention in here about any
  �
    11 confusion in your mind that, in fact, there is a
    12 $500.00 per -- or excuse me -- a -- a five-year option
    13 period on this lease; correct?
     14 A. Five-year option, yes.
  �
     15 Q. Okay. And the option is -- the proposal
  �
    16 you’re making here is the option can be exercised by
    17 the oil company, Mason Dixon, if it pays you $500.00
    18 per acre to exercise the option and then $140.00 for
    19 delay rental for the -- each year thereafter for that
    20 second five-year period; correct?
     21 A. Correct.
  �
     22 Q. And the gist of Mr. Marshall’s response, which
  �
    23 appear -- or strike that.
     24 Let me ask you this: Were you discussing this
 �

```

-----

```
                                          Page 64
     1 -- well, obviously you were discussing this with your
     2 Uncle Tom?
     3 A. Yes.
  �
     4 Q. Okay. Do you recall anything more about the
  �
     5 conversation with your Uncle Tom? I think you
     6 referred to that earlier, which is "Try to negotiate
     7 the delay rental up to a higher amount."
      8 Is this your effort that you referred to
 �
     9 earlier?
     10 A. Yeah.
  �
     11 Q. Okay. The gist of Mr. Marshall’s response was
  �
    12 he would take it to the oil company, but $100.00 per
    13 acre is the highest that he had seen, and it’s
    14 probably the only -- the only amount that they’re
    15 going to agree to.
     16 Is that a fair characterization of his
 �
    17 response?
     18 A. Yes.
  �
     19 Q. Okay. And in your question you don’t ask
  �
    20 anything about whether you have an option to accept or
    21 reject the oil company -- any decision by the oil
    22 company to exercise the fifth-year option, that is,
    23 the second five-year option; is that fair?
     24 A. It’s not mentioned in here.

```
                                         Page 651
     1 Q. Okay. Did you get a response from
 �
     2 Mr. Marshall or from Mason Dixon with regard to your
     3 $140.00 proposal for the delay rental during the
     4 second -- during the option period; the second
     5 five-year period?
     6 A. Yes.
  �
     7 Q. And what was its response?
  �
     8A. No.
  �
     9 Q. Okay. It -- it said it would pay the $100.00
  �
    10 per acre? Would that be fair?
     11 A. Yes.
  �
     12 Q. And ultimately you went ahead and signed the
  �
    13 lease, did you not?
     14 A. Yes.

     3 describe the conditions under which it may do that;

     6 points that you made earlier that I wanted to loop
     7 back around to was that you didn’t believe there was

`3` Q. `Now, do you believe you received the check`

     6 dates.

`7` Q. `Do you have the ability? You brought your`

     8 records with you today. Do you have the ability to

     22 A. No.

     1 I just stated earlier.
     2 Q. The transfer of the property -- or excuse me
  �
     3 -- the lease from Mason Dixon to Hess?
     4 A. Yes.
  �
     5 Q. That’s the notice that you received in Exhibit
  �
     6 No. 10?
     7 A. Yes.
  �
     8 Q. Any other reason?
  �
     9 A. As I stated, that was an indicator to me that
  �
    10 Mason -- that Mr. Marshall was not honest and
    11 forthright with me from the beginning of our
    12 conversations discussing any type of oil and gas
    13 lease.
     14 Q. Okay. Nonetheless you do acknowledge that
  �
    15 under Section 10 of the lease there is an ability of
    16 Mason Dixon to transfer its rights under the lease to
    17 another entity, such as Hess?
     18 Would that be fair?
 �
     19 A. I acknowledge that that’s what you read to me.
  �
     20 Q. Okay. And that -- you acknowledge that’s part
  �
    21 of your lease?
     22 A. Section 10 is part of my lease.
  �
     23 Q. All right. Any other reason that you didn’t
  �
    24 sign this, other than the transfer? I’m just trying

```

```
     1 to understand the full reason.
     2 A. Why I didn’t cash the check?
 �

```
3 Q.
###### �[Yeah, that you didn’t cash the check; yes, ]
```
     4 sir.
     5 A. Those reasons led me to seek counsel.
 �

```
6 Q.
###### �[Okay. So you received the notice from Hess ]
```
     7 and you received the check, and at that point then you
     8 went to a lawyer?
     9 A. I received a check and I received the notice.
 �
    10 I don’t know what order, but yes --

```
11 Q. `Fair enough.`
###### �
```
    12 A. -- at that point I went to seek legal
  �
    13 counsel.
    14 Q. And who did you go see?
  �
     15 A. I believe I contacted Mr. Costirie in
  �

```
16 `St. Clairsville.`
`17` Q. `That isn’t who you talked to before, is it?`
###### �
```
     18 A. What do you mean?
  �

```
19 Q. `It’s a different lawyer than you talked to`

    20 before?
     21 A. Yes, it’s a different lawyer.

     21 meeting; what you learned.
     22 A. I learned there was a lot of other people who
     23 were misled in signing oil and gas agreements.

`24` Q. `Misled in what way?`


-----

`Page 84` I
```
      1 A. Misled by their landmen.

     6 I’ve had a little bit of a health problem. I set
     7 aside two hours for the deposition. I’m hopeful that
     8 you can get most of what you want done by 3:00
     9 o’clock, and it’s about 20 till 3:00.
     10 MR. KLOSS: I’m going to try.
 �
     11 MR. LANCIONE: Okay. Because I thought
 �
    12 we would have to terminate the deposition at 3:00
    13 o’clock.
     14 MR. KLOSS: Wow. Are you going to come
 �
    15 -- come to Columbus if we’re not done? I’m not -- I’m
    16 certainly not going to get her done (indicating). I’m
    17 not going to come over here a second time. If I would
    18 have known there was some limitation on your ability,
    19 but I can’t understand. I would have assumed that
    20 Tracey could handle this.

     4 A. The understanding of the claims is that I was
  �
     5 very, very -- to sum this up, that I was very misled
     6 is one of the claims. And the other claim is that
     7 under the bonus agreement after the -- we had an
     8 option to delay rent twice.
     9 Q. To delay it twice or to delay it once?
  �
     10 A. I’m not clear on that.
  �
     11 Q. Okay. Well, you understood that when you
  �
    12 signed the lease, because you told us that your
    13 understanding is that they could pay you on a yearly
    14 basis for the first five years for the primary term of
    115 the lease.
    116 That was your understanding in the lease that
 �
    17 you signed; correct?
     18 A. My understanding is that the rental agreement
  �
    19 was for $100.00 per year.
     20 Q. $100.00 per year, and it could be up to five
  �
    21 years during the primary term; correct?
     22 A. It could be up to five years.
  �
     23 Q. And where is it you came up with this theory
  �
    24 that you could only extend it once, which seems

     1 contrary to the -- which is contrary to your

      4 MR. LANCIONE: I’m going to object at

      7 But go ahead.

     8 Q. (By Mr. Kioss) Go ahead.

       �
     17 to be sensitive to is the discussions you had with
    118 your counsel after he’s been retained.
     19 Suffice it to say this: Would you agree with

    20 me that your theory or your view on this that it could
    21 only be extended once, that view arose after you
    22 contacted counsel?

**i) I) MI "131**
This Addendum is attached to and made a part of that certain Oil and Gas Lease dated � , by
and between Edward Absalonj [as Lessor, and MASON DIXON ENERGY, INC., as Lessee. If any of the ]
following provisions conflict with or are inconsistent with any of the printed provisions or terms of this Lease, the
following provisions shall control,
The location of wells, roads, tanks, pipelines and other appurtenant facilities shall be mutually agreed upon by
Lessor and Lessee. Lessor’s consent to any such locations shall not be unreasonably withheld.
This lease does not cover the right to install pipelines from any wells not located on the above leased premises or
unitized herewith.
Lessee agrees it will protect and save and keep Lessor harmless and indemnified against and from any penalty or
damage or charges imposed for any violation of any laws or ordinances, whether occasioned by the neglect of
Lessee or those holding under Lessee, and Lessee will at all times protect, indemnify and save and keep harmless the
Lessor against and from any and all loss, damage or expense, including any injury to any person or property
whomsoever or whatsoever arising out of or caused by any negligence of the Lessee or those holding under Lessee.
In the event Lessee’s operations conducted pursuant to the terms of this lease materially damages any fresh water
supply located on these leased premises, Lessee shall, at its sole cost and expense, make reasonable efforts to correct
any such damages.
Upon cessation of operations on the leased premises, the surface of any portion of the leasehold utilized by Lessee in
conducting operations under the lease shall be restored, as nearly as is reasonably possible, to the conditions which
existed prior to the commencement of such operations and in accordance with good oilfield practices and relevant
laws.
Prior to the drilling of a well on the leased premises, the Lessee shall pay to the Lessor an initial damage settlement
equal to Two Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($2,500.00). Such payment shall be made to Lessor by Lessee prior
to commencement of actual drilling by Lessee on the leased premises. This initial damage settlement is not intended
to cover actual damages caused to growing crops and timber caused as a result of Lessee’s operations on the leased
premises.
Lessee agrees that any oil produced from a well located on Lessor’s lands subject to this lease shall be sold and
removed on a reasonable schedule and not stored on Lessor’s lands.
Notwithstanding intervention by any governmental agency having jurisdiction over such matters, Lessee agrees that
no well drilled on Lessor’s lands or lands pooled therewith shall be shut-in for more than a two year continuous
period.
Lessee agrees that this lease does not cover any coal rights belonging to Lessor, nor impairs any rights of the Lessor
to convey such coal as may underlie the leased premises by deed, lease or otherwise. However, it is understood that
the lease does cover coalbed methane gas which may be contained within coal formations which may underlie the
leased premises.
The above-described leased premises cannot be used for the storage of gas and all reference to storage shall be
deleted from this lease.
Lessee agrees that no rental amounts or bonus payments made to Lessor by Lessee may be recouped.
Lessee agrees that Lessor’s royalty payment for production sold from Lessor’s property will be based on the price
received by Lessee at the wellhead for gas and the oil price paid by the purchaser on the day of oil sale.
Prior to the plugging of a well or wells drilled on lands subject to this Lease, Lessee shall have the right of first
refusal to purchase said well(s) at the salvage price of all pipe and equipment less the cost of plugging. Lessee shall

St Clairsvllle, Ohio _43950_
###### (The Marquette Exploration Project in Jefferson & Belmont Counties)
I hope the following information will be helpful to you. As you know, Mason Dixon
Energy, Inc. has been contracted to acquire oil and gas leases on behalf of Marquette
Exploration, LLC, 2002 Timberloch P1., Suite 440, ’The Woodlands, Texas 77380, for the
purposes of exploring for, developing and producing natural gas in Jefferson and
Belmont Counties, Ohio. This office will be maintained throughout the drilling,
development and production phases.
Marquette is a Delaware limited liability company formed jointly in 2006 by Richard W.
Wilken, President, Gerald P. Zieche, Vice-President of Exploration, James B. (Trey)
Shepherd HI, Vice-President of Land and Terry J. Huchton, Vice-President of
Operations, all of whom are former Burlington Resources employees prior to the Conoco
buyout of Burlington. As stated in their website, Marquette’s financial partner is Encap
Investments LT who has, for the past 18 years, successfully funded conventional and
unconventional oil and gas projects in the U.S.
Permitting, drilling and operations will be managed by Brammer Engineering, Inc., 400
Texas Street, Suite 600, Shreveport, La 71101, bonded as an Ohio Operator.
Drilling and completions will be supervised by Wilson Consulting Services, LLC, 5600
Skyline Drive, Cambridge, Oh _43725._
Mason Dixon Energy, Inc. has acquired in excess of 55,000 acres of oil and gas rights to
date in Belmont and Jefferson County, Ohio. The highest concentration of acreage is in
Jefferson County, the primary area of interest. We are striving to acquire an additional
25,000 acres in strategic locations in Belmont and Jefferson, one of which is where your
property is situated.
The plan is to drill two evaluation wells in 2008 and if successful, 10-15 wells in 2009,
20-25 wells in 2010 and incremental increases in the years to _come._ Each well location
will be chosen based on (1) proximity to previously drilled successful wells and (2) the
amount of surrounding participating leased acreage available for additional development.


-----

At the present time the first two wells have been drilled in section 20 of Cross Creek
Township and section 3 of Wayne Township. These locations are drilled to an
approximate depth of 7,800 feet, penetrating to the bottom of the Clinton sandstone
formation. Based on Marquette’s geological evaluations of available data, the wells
should produce a moderate but profitable amount of natural gas. The logs and production
from the wells will provide valuable information in determining the potential of the area
and the location of additional wells.
Actual production won’t begin for approximately one month because pipeline right of
ways must be secured and a pipeline built approximately seven miles to connect with an
existing line capable of handling future volumes from multiple wells. The absence of
pipelines in Belmont and Jefferson County, compounded by low oil & gas prices in the
past are the principal reasons that the area has generated little interest until now.
Although gas pricing is not at a peak at this time, its level, in combination with
unconventional completion techniques is favorable to exploration investment. The cost
of drilling, completing and preparing each well for production will be between $750,000
and $900,000, depending on well site construction and gathering line costs.
In summary, the project was initiated after a great deal of study and evaluation and is
long term, comprehensive, well funded and professionally staffed. I believe that you
would be well satisfied as a participant.
If I may provide you with additional information, please give me a call.
Sincerely,
John Marshall 724-495-9964 cell

Ed,
The addendum written below will be added to your lease and should satisfy your questions regarding
the responsibility for any portion of the maintenance cost of wells and any pipe lines that _might be_
taken out of the royalties before or after production starts. Please refer to the attached addendum. I
have included the clause written _below. I_ emailed you an addendum and a project letter previously
did you receive the attachments? Let me know if not I will resend those documents.
**Lessee shall make no deduction to Lessor’s royalty for Lessee’s operating costs for gathering,**
**compression or marketing gas produced and sold from lands covered hereunder.**

This is a common question asked by landowners. It is a good question. First let me assure you this clause
dose not mean that any land purchased after signing this lease automatically becomes part of the tease. The
_reason for this clause can be explained by an example, and highlighting a few words in the clause itself._ _"In_
_addition to above described land, this lease also covers accretions and strips_ _or parcels of land now_
_or hereafter owned by lessor which are contiguous or adjacent to the above described land,_
_including any interest therein which the lessor may hereafter acquire by reversion, prescription, or_
_otherwise_ _"Reversion- Refers to your land that might be used for or by the state of Ohio, the courts, or some_
other institution, for roads, easements, Etc.and reverts back to you when no longer useful or applicable to
these said institutions. **Accretions**                       - Refers to land gained by erosion of streams, the increase of land
_by the action of natural forces,_ _Etc._ _Prescription - Land that might be mandated by law to you by the_
courts as a result of a divorce, inheritance, death, Etc. The lands referred to are lands already owned or
included in your farm and surrounding contiguous land. Or otherwise - refers to basically the same
concept, and will be stricken from your lease. The word "otherwise" is an all inclusive word and is
not required in this lease. Please refer to the attached lease and the clause highlighted in black. This
tease is talking about property that surrounds your property and that may come into your possession. I
hope this explanation and revision will resolve this issue.
Thank you for your concern in this matter. Feet free to contact me with any more questions and concerns.
Sincerely,
John Marshall
PS: I have the lease heading referring to you as married. Your wife is not on the deed. Are you married? If so
MOE would like to include your wife on the lease just in case God forbid something happens to you. If this
creates a problem the lease heading can remain as written.

Subject: Question?
Hi John,
This should be my last question. In section 41 of the lease in the last section it talks
about "in addition to above described land, this lease also covers accretions and strips or parcels of
land now or hereafter owned by lessor which are contiguous or adjacent to the above described
land, including any interest therein which the lessor may hereafter acquire by reversion,
prescription, or otherwise.’
Does this mean that any land that! may acquire in the future that is not attached to my
existing property is also subject to this lease or is it talking about property that surrounds my
property that may come into my possession?
Thanks Ed

of leased premises or rights therewith with any other land in the vicinity thereof, or with any leasehold, operating, or other rights or interests in such other land so as to
create units of such size and surface acreage as Lessee may desire but containing not more than eighty (80) acres for an oil well and not more than six hundred forty
(640) acres for a gas well plus in each case a ten percent (10%) acreage tolerance. If at any time larger units we specified under any then applicable law, rule,

Ed,
I will be glad to forward to you the completed lease with all the necessary addendums and the $500.00 per
acre amount as designated in the order of payment document. I will present your $140.00 per acre counter
offer to my project foreman. It is my understanding and Tom has this understanding also that $100.00 per acre
for every year except year 6 is the highest offer available. If Tom has expressed anything different please have
Tom contact me with this information. As I have explained to Tom, I have taken higher offers to my superiors
in the past and they were all declined. Mason Dixon Energy and Marquette Exp. has given me the authority to
approve $100.00 per acre for every year except year 6, (nothing higher). I will contact you in regards to their
decision but I feel certain the delay rental payments must remain as initially proposed.
Thank you,

###### John,
Thank you for answering my questions. In reply to your question please do add my wife to
the lease agreement.
I am satisfied with the bulk of the agreement. My proposal to you is I _would [like to leave ]_
the lease in the format that we have been discussing with the attached addendums and changes
made to lease for myself and for Tom including the sixth year $500.00 per acer amount. However
the annual per acer amount I _would like to increase to $140.00 per acer every five years and_
thereafter 7th,8th,9th and 10th this figure would better suit my personal plans for the rental income
of my property during the rental period whatever that may be. I have been discussing this with Tom
and if this proposal is acceptable we will agree to sign with Mason Dixon Energy
Thank you for your consideration.

jurisdiction, such market value or net proceeds shall in no event exceed the amount received by Lessee, not subject to refund, calculated, or allocated back to the wells
from which produced, making allowance and deduction for a fair and reasonable charge for gathering , compressing, and making merchantable such gas, and which
amount may be further adjusted up or down prospectively or retrospectively when the price or rateauthorized by such governments] agency is finally determined.
Lessor agrees to pay any and all taxes levied or assessed upon its interest in the production of oil and gas from the leased premises and Lessee is hereby authorized to
pay such taxes and assessments on behalf of Lessor and to deduct the amount so paid from any monies payable to Lessor hereunder. In the evens any extraneous
substance (being any substance that is obtained from sources other than the leased premises or lands pooled or unitized therewith) is injected into subsurface strata in
connection with secondary, tertiary, or other enhanced recovery operations hereunder, any like substance thereafter produced hereunder, or contained in oil or gas
thereafter produced hereunder, from such strata shall be deemed to be part of the extraneous substance so injected until the total volume thereof equals the total volume
_of the extraneous substance so injected, and no royalty shall be payable hereunder on any such extraneous substance. During any period (whether before or after_
expiration of the primacy term hereof) where there is a gas well on the leased premises or on a unit that includes all or a part of the leased premises, however designated,
capable of producing gas and gas is not being sold or used on or off the leased premises and the well or wells are shut-in and there is no current production of oil or
operations on any part of said leased premises sufficient to keep this lease in fbrce. Lessee shall be obligated to pay or tender as shut-in rental the amount of Ten Dollars
($10.00) per net acre of this lease contained in the drilling unit (which shall be the same and shall be paid regardless of the number of shut-in wells and regardless of
whether the shut-in well or wells be located upon said teased premises or upon such other acreage as is embraced in such unit) for each six (6) month period during the
shut-in period and it will be considered that gas is produced, for all purposes of this lease, during any period that such well or walls are so shut-in; such amount for the
font six (6) month period lobe payable within ninety (90) days following shutting-in of the last well, and payment for each subsequent nix (6) month period, if required.

Lessor by chock or draft of Lessee and such payments may be commenced and continued either during or beyond the primary term. Lessee’s failure to property pay
such rental payments shall render Lessee liable for the amount due but shall not operate to terminate this lease. Lessee shall use reasonable diligence to market gas
capable of being produced from such shut-in well or wells, but shalt be under no obligation to market such gas under terms, condition, or circumstances which, in
Lessee’s judgement exercised in good faith, are unsatisfactory.

purchase of Marquette and our plans for the future.
We have been working closely with Marquette and we will commence work as Hess
immediately. Work is underway to develop a long term plan for developing Hess’ acreage in
the Utica Shale. While there will be some operations this year, the activity level in 2012 will
increase significantly. Early next year, we will hold meetings totell you more about our plans
