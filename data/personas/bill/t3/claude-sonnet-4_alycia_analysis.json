  "chunk_0-0": "Based on the limited information provided (just the deposition caption and stipulations), I would focus on **immediately establishing Amy Absalom's relationship to Edmund Absalom and her specific knowledge of the underlying dispute with Mason Dixon Energy**. \n\nThis foundational questioning will reveal whether she's a fact witness with direct knowledge or primarily a damages witness, which will dictate the entire strategic approach for the remainder of the deposition. Given that Edmund is present, there may be spousal privilege considerations or she may have unique insight into family financial impacts that need to be carefully explored before diving into substantive areas.",
  "chunk_0-1": "Focus immediately on the deponent's statement that the lease language is \"very confusing\" and \"not clear\" - this creates a strong foundation to challenge her understanding of key lease terms and potentially undermine any testimony about what she believed the lease required or permitted. Use this admission to systematically go through each disputed lease provision and establish that she cannot reliably testify about the parties' intentions or her understanding of specific terms.",
  "chunk_0-2": "Focus on establishing the deponent's complete lack of independent decision-making and reliance solely on Ed for all lease-related matters. \n\nNext strategic move: **Immediately lock down testimony that she made zero independent inquiry into lease terms, had no discussions with anyone except Ed about the lease substance, and signed based entirely on Ed's representations without her own due diligence.**\n\nFollow with: \"So you're telling this court that you signed this lease without ever asking a single question about its terms to anyone - not the oil company, not Mr. Marshall, not even Ed - is that correct?\"\n\nThis creates an unambiguous record of her passive role and complete dependence on Ed's judgment, which could be crucial for any claims about her knowledge, consent, or liability regarding lease terms.",
  "chunk_0-3": "Focus immediately on pinning down the exact timing and sequence of when the deponent retrieved the lease documents from Hess's office relative to the September transfer notice. The witness is being evasive about the timeline (\"I couldn't say for certain\") which suggests this timing may be crucial to establishing whether they had actual or constructive knowledge of the transfer before taking certain actions. Press for specific dates, who sent them, what letter they carried, and why Ed needed this particular copy if he already had the original lease."
