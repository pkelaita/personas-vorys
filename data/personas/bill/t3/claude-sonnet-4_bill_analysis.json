  "chunk_0-0": "Looking at this preliminary page of the deposition transcript, I see the standard case caption and appearances, but no substantive testimony yet. Given my approach of exhaustive preparation and document mastery, my immediate focus would be:\n\n**Ensure I have complete access to all documents referenced in discovery and verify that plaintiff's counsel has produced everything required - particularly any communications, agreements, or records between the Absaloms and Mason Dixon Energy that could reveal the true nature of their relationship and any potential damages claims.**\n\nThis foundational step is critical because, as I always emphasize, \"you gotta know your documents\" and \"it's all about eliminating surprise.\" Without seeing the actual testimony yet, I need to be certain I'm armed with every piece of documentary evidence before proceeding with substantive questioning of Amy Absalom.",
  "chunk_0-1": "Focus immediately on exploring what specific aspects of the lease language she found \"confusing\" and \"not clear.\" Ask her to identify the exact provisions that were unclear to her and what she thought they meant versus what she was told they meant. This directly attacks the validity of her informed consent to the lease terms and could establish grounds for reformation or rescission based on mutual mistake or lack of understanding of material terms.",
  "chunk_0-2": "Focus on the deponent's complete reliance on Ed for all lease-related decisions and communications. The key strategic move is to establish through detailed questioning that the deponent had no independent understanding of the lease terms, relied entirely on Ed's interpretation and judgment, and was essentially a passive signature on the document. This creates a foundation to argue the deponent lacked the knowledge or capacity to make informed decisions about the lease, which could be crucial for challenging the validity of their consent or establishing grounds for rescission based on lack of informed consent.",
  "chunk_0-3": "**Focus immediately on the timeline discrepancy and the witness's access to documents at Hess.**\n\nThe witness just admitted to retrieving documents from Hess's office, but there's a critical gap in the chronology that needs to be pinned down. The witness cannot definitively place when this document retrieval occurred relative to the September transfer notice, yet claims to have obtained the \"same\" contract from Hess that they already had. This suggests either: (1) multiple versions of documents exist, (2) the witness had premature access to Hess files, or (3) there's confusion about what documents were actually retrieved and when.\n\nNail down the exact date of the Hess office visit, who authorized the witness to access these files, what specific documents were actually retrieved, and why the witness was sent to get documents they allegedly already possessed. This timeline issue could reveal premature coordination between parties or document irregularities that undermine the opposing party's position."
