  "chunk_0-0": "Based on this opening portion of the deposition transcript, I would focus on **establishing Amy Absalom's foundational knowledge and relationship to the core factual issues** through systematic questioning about her background, her connection to Edmund Absalom (likely a family member given the shared surname), and her direct observations or involvement with Mason Dixon Energy's operations.\n\nThe most critical strategic move is to immediately begin \"scene painting\" - getting Amy comfortable through personal rapport-building questions, then methodically establishing her vantage point and what she personally witnessed, heard, or experienced related to the defendants' conduct. This foundational testimony will determine whether she's a key fact witness or primarily providing corroborative details, which will shape the entire trajectory of the deposition and reveal what system architecture elements (corporate operations, communications, decision-making processes) she can illuminate.",
  "chunk_0-1": "**Focus immediately on the deponent's confusion about lease terms and leverage her admission that the contract language is unclear.**\n\nThe deponent has already admitted she read the lease but found the wording \"very confusing\" and \"not clear\" - not understandable \"in layman's terms.\" This creates a perfect foundation to systematically explore each lease provision she claims to have understood, exposing gaps between her stated understanding and the actual contract language. Use her own words about the contract's complexity to undermine any assertions that she had meaningful comprehension of critical terms like the option period, delay rental duration, and other key provisions.\n\nThis \"scene painting\" approach will reveal the true extent of her understanding while building a record that the lease terms were not reasonably comprehensible to a layperson.",
  "chunk_0-2": "Focus on establishing the specific timeline and sequence of when the spouse became involved in lease discussions versus when key lease terms were finalized. Ask: \"When exactly did Ed start talking to you about the lease terms - was this before or after the lease language was already drafted and ready for signing?\" This will expose whether the spouse had any meaningful opportunity to influence or understand the lease terms before they were locked in, which is critical for establishing informed consent and potential duress/undue influence claims.",
  "chunk_0-3": "Focus immediately on establishing the exact timeline and sequence of when the witness retrieved the lease documents from Hess in St. Clairsville relative to the September transfer notice. This witness has revealed a critical gap in their knowledge about document timing that could expose whether they had actual authority or knowledge of key lease terms when they acted. Pin down specifically: (1) whether they retrieved documents before or after the September notice, (2) what letter they were given to present at Hess, and (3) who exactly instructed them to retrieve these documents and why the original couldn't be located."
