  "chunk_0-0": "Carefully observe the demeanor of Amy L. Absalom as the deposition begins, watching for signs of discomfort, confusion, or over-preparation. Immediately direct the first questions to low-stakes, foundational personal background topics to establish her comfort, build rapport, and provide a baseline for detecting shifts in her demeanor as questioning becomes more substantive.",
  "chunk_0-1": "Focus on clarifying and documenting the *limitations of the deponent\u2019s understanding* of the lease terms\u2014specifically, what aspects of the contract language she found confusing and what, if any, representations were made to her to explain those terms\u2014by asking her to specify which provisions were unclear and whether she sought or was offered clarification from any party prior to signing.",
  "chunk_0-2": "Lock down and clarify the scope of the deponent's actual knowledge and involvement by asking a precise, closed-ended question: \u201cIs it fair to say that aside from being present for the signing and basic introductions, you had no substantive involvement in negotiating or communicating about the lease terms with anyone from Mason Dixon or the oil company?\u201d This makes explicit their limited personal knowledge, insulating future testimony from overreach and later impeachment.",
  "chunk_0-3": "Lock down the timeline and chain of custody regarding the lease document: Pin the witness to specific dates, people involved, and the exact process of obtaining and transferring the lease and Order for Payment, using direct document references to clarify any confusion or contradiction for later impeachment or corroboration."
