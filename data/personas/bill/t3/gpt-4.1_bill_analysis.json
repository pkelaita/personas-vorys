  "chunk_0-1": "Given the deponent's repeated references to the lease's \"confusing wording,\" my next strategic move is to **methodically walk her through the critical lease language, provision by provision, to nail down exactly what she did and did not understand at the time of signing, creating a detailed record of ambiguities or misunderstandings that could be crucial for any arguments about intent or contractual clarity.**",
  "chunk_0-2": "Focus immediately on clarifying and pinning down exactly what (if any) independent understanding the deponent had of the lease terms before signing\u2014specifically their knowledge of the critical clauses, and whether they relied entirely on Ed and Mr. Marshall, or reviewed any documents themselves\u2014because this will control both their credibility and any agency/knowledge defenses. Get the deponent to admit, as precisely as possible, to having no substantive discussions, no independent questions, and no individualized understanding of the lease's key provisions prior to signing.",
  "chunk_0-3": "Drill down on **the chronology and purpose behind retrieving Exhibit 12**: Lock down exactly when the witness picked up the contract, what triggered that action, and whether any instructions or communications (emails, letters, phone calls) exist documenting that sequence. Pin the witness on details\u2014dates, communications received or delivered, the identity of who sent them, and how Exhibit 12 compares to other versions of the lease\u2014to expose any inconsistency or ambiguity the opposing counsel may be probing for."
