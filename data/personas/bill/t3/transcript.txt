     3 being first duly sworn, was examined and testified as
     4 follows:
 �
      6 EXAMINATION
 �
     7 BY MR. KLOSS:
     8 Q. Mrs. Absalom, have you ever had your
  �
     9 deposition taken before?
     10 A. No.
  �
     11 Q. You just saw the process. It’s the same.
  �
     12 A. Okay.
  �
     13 Q. Give me your answers out loud. Let me know if
  �
    14 I ask a question that doesn’t make sense. I want to
    15 make sure we’re communicating. All right?
     �
     16 A. Okay.
  �
     17 Q. Did you have anything to do with the
  �
    18 negotiation of this lease?
     19 A. Only in the signing of it, yes.
  �
     20 Q. Did you have any discussions with Mr. Absalom
  �
    21 prior to the execution of the lease?
     22 A. Just briefly, like what he went over with
  �
    23 John, what you heard that he testified --
     24 Q. Okay.
  �

`Page 6` I
```
      1 A. -- to.
    �

```
`2` Q. `You understood that it was a five-year lease`
```
      3 with a five-year option?
      4 A. That was my understanding, yeah.
        �

```
`5` Q. `And there was an amount paid at or around the`
```
      6 time the lease was signed, that is, the initial
      ��
      7 $3,744.00 that we --
    �
      8 A. Yes.

```
`9` Q. `You understood that was to be paid?`
```
     10 A. Yes.

```
`11` Q. `And then you also -- did you also understand`
```
     12 that for every year, if there was no activity, no
     � �
     13 drilling on your property, that you would receive that
     14 amount which is referred to as a delay rental; the
     15 $3,774.00, or the $100.00 per acre?
     16 A. For a certain amount of time --

```
`17` Q. `Yes.`
```
     18 A. -- yes.
    �

```
`19` Q. `Okay.` `What was the "certain amount of time"?`
```
   �
     20 A. I was not -- I’m not certain on that --

```
`21` Q. `Okay.`
```
     22 A. -- because the wording in the contract is --

```
`23` Q. `All right.`
```
     24 A. -- very confusing.

```

-----

`Page 7` I
```
     1 Q. All right. And you understood that -- but you
  �
     2 also understood that there was a possibility that
     3 there could be an option for a second five years that
     4 could be exercised?
     5 A. I’m not -- I’m not sure.
  �
     6 Q. All right.
  �
     7 A. I can’t say "yes" or "no" to that, no.
  �
     8 Q. Did you ever read the lease prior to signing
  �
     9 it?
    10 A. Yes.
  �
     11 Q. You did?
  �
     12 A. Yes.
  �
     13 Q. Okay.
  �
     14 A. Before in -- in the bank we had talked about
  �
    15 it again, and we had looked it over. And just the
    16 wording in the contract is not --
     17 Q. Okay.
  �
     18 A. It’s not clear.
  �
     19 Q. Okay.
  �
     20 A. It’s not something that you can just sit down
  �
    21 and think you’re going to understand it in layman’s
    22 terms.
     23 Q. It’s a legal document; is that fair?
  �
     24 A. Exactly, yes.
  �

```

`Page 8` I
1 Q. `But nonetheless, you did have the opportunity,`
###### �
```
     2 and you did, in fact, review it?
     3 A. Yes.
  �

```
`4` Q. `Did you, yourself, ask Mr. Marshall or anybody`
###### �
```
     5 else any questions?
     6 A. Not myself, no. No, Ed did most of the
  �
     7 talking. I didn’t.
  �
     8 Q. And did you ever ask Ed to rely -- relay any
  �
     9 specific questions that you had about the lease prior
    10 to signing it?
    11 A. No.
  �

```
`12` Q. `What about anyone from the oil company?`
###### �
```
    13 A. No. He took care of that.
  �

```
`14` Q. `All right. You said you went to the bank.`
###### �
```
    15 take it you went to the bank because that’s where a
    16 notary was?
    17 A. Yes. Uh-huh.
  �

```
18 Q. So `the -- so both signatures were done in the`
###### �
```
    19 bank before a notary?
    20 A. Yes.
  �

```
`21` Q. `Did you attend the meeting with Mr. Lancione`
###### �
```
    22 that Mr. Lancione held?
    23 A. The one --
  �
    24 Q. The one prior to retaining him?
  �

```

-----

`Page 9` I
```
     1 A. No. No, I did not.
 �
     2 Q. Did you have -- ever have any discussions with
 �
     3 anybody from Mason Dix- -- Mason Dixon or anybody
     4 associated with Mason Dixon about the lease?
     5 A. No. Other than John Marshall, that was --
  �
     6 Q. Okay.
  �
     7 A. I mean, there was -- we had met him once. I
  �
     8 recall meeting him one time. And then it was when we
     9 signed.
    10 Q. All right. Was Mr. Marshall present when you
  �
    11 signed?
    12 A. Yes.
  �
    13 Q. The one time that you did meet Mr. Marshall
  �
    14 prior to signing the lease, was that just a "Hello.
    15 How are you," or was there some substance of the lease
    16 discussed?
     17 A. The only thing I remember is that it was just
  �
    18 like a basic introduction. And he had come to our
    19 house, but I don’t remember any of the conversation.
    20 That was too long ago.
     21 Q. So Mr. Marshall didn’t sit down with you and
  �
    22 go through the pieces and parcels of the lease, or did
    23 he?
     24 A. I think at that time there wasn’t a whole lot

                                          Page 10
     1 that was said when he initially talked until when
     2 there was actually the signing. In the beginning, Ed
     3 was just inquiring about it. There wasn’t a whole lot
     4 that I was involved in.

```
5 Q.
###### �[Okay. ]
```
     6 A. He wasn’t even sure that -- that we were going
 �
     7 to go that route. And then later down the road, just
     8 because I am the spouse and having my name put on the
     9 document itself, that’s when Ed started talking to me
    10 a little bit about it. But by then, there had been so
    11 much that had transpired that I wasn’t --

```
`12` Q. `The train had left the station?`
###### �
```
     13 A. Yes. I was not there from Day 1 --
  �

```
`14` Q. `All right.`
###### �

15 `A.` `-- exactly.`
```
  �

```
`16` Q. `And so you understood the basics of it, but`
###### �
```
    17 not the specifics?
     18 A. Exactly, yes.
  �

```
`19` Q. `And the basics were that it was a --`
###### �
```
    20 A. Just what the documents showed so...
  �

```
`21` Q. `Okay. There was going to be some rent. There`
###### �
```
    22 was a five-year initial lease. There was going to be
    23 some yearly rent paid?
     24 A. Yes.
  �

```

-----

`Page 11` I
```
     1 Q. Okay. Now, when you -- when you actually went
 �
     2 to signing -- to the signing of the lease at the bank,
     3 do you recall anything about your conversation with
     4 Mr. Marshall then?
    5A. No.
  �
     6 Q. Exhibit 12 that we previously marked, you
  �
     7 seemed to know something about that?
     8 A. It looked like the copy that we used when we
  �
     9 obtained the contract at Hess, I think.

```
I `[10 Q. ]` `Okay.`
```
  �
    ill A. I went and picked that document up --
  �

```
I `[12 Q. ]` `Okay.`
```
  �
    113 A. -- in St. Clairsville. And I think that that
  �
    114 maybe was it. I’m not 100 percent sure. I did go.
    15 That was prior to coming here to -- to the lawyer’s
    16 office. It was before Ed even set up that with him
    17 that he wanted to get the contract just to make sure
    18 it was the same one that we had. I think he was --
    19 he was looking -- looking for the contract. I don’t
    20 think he could find it at home. And he sent me to go
    21 get that. And --
     22 Q. Okay.
  �
     23 A. -- that’s, I think -- to the best of my
  �
    24 knowledge, I think that that was what that pertained

     1 to.

```
`2` Q. `So you believed this happened after the notice`
###### �
```
     3 came out that was in September of --
     4 A. Which notice are you talking about?
  �

```
5 Q.
###### �[The notice that came out about the transfer to ]
```
     6 Hess.
     7 A. I couldn’t say for certain.
  �

```
8 Q.
###### �[Okay. ]
```
     9 A. But I’m -- I couldn’t say for certain or
  �
    10 absolute.

```
11 Q. `And you said you went in and actually picked`
###### �
```
    12 up a copy of the lease and the Order for Payment?
     13 A. Yes.
  �

```
`14` Q. `Where did you pick that up?`
###### �

15 `A.` `That was in St. Clairsville, if that is what`
```
  �
    16 that pertains to.

```
`17` Q. `Okay. Do you believe there’s another document`
###### �

18 `that that could pertain to?`
```
     19 A. Not -- not that I know of. I mean, I know I
  �
    20 went to go pick that up, and I think -- I think he did
    21 send me with a letter.

```
`22` Q. `Who’s office was that?`
###### �
```
     23 A. Hess.
  �

```
`24` Q. `Hess?`
###### �


-----

`Page 13` I
```
     1 A. (Nodding affirmatively.)
 �

```
`2` Q. `So let me make sure. I don’t want to belabor`
###### �
```
     3 this. Lawyers are masters at doing that.
      4 So you think you actually took this to the
 �
     5 Hess office?
     6 A. If it is the one that I’m thinking of. I know
  �
     7 I had gone to Hess to pick up the contract.

```
8 Q.
###### �[Okay. ]
```
     9 A. Whether that is the specific note that we
  �
    10 had, I’m not sure. But I do know that we took a note,
    11 but since that is not dated on there --

```
`12` Q. `Yes.`
###### �
```
     13 A. -- I couldn’t say for certain.
  �
     14 Q. All right. Well, whenever you went to pick up
  �
    15 the contract, you do recall, however, that you went to
    16 the Hess office?
     17 A. Yes.
  �

```
18 `Q.` `So obviously, if it was the Hess office, you`
```
  �
    19 must have been aware to go to a Hess office. So is it
    20 safe to say it came out at the -- at that time?
     21 A. Well, we -- we knew that Hess was -- now had
  �
    22 our contract, yes.
     23 Q. That was my question.
  �
     24 A. Yes.
  �

```

-----

`Page 14` I
```
     1 Q. It came out after that notice from Hess?
 �
     2 A. Yes.
 �
     3 Q. Do you believe that there’s anything that
 �
     4 Mr. Marshall said to you that was untrue?
     5 A. We didn’t have -- we didn’t have a whole lot
 �
     6 of conversation together that I recall, so I can’t
     7 answer that.
     8 Q. Did you ever have any e-mail exchanges with
 �
     9 with Mr. --
   I1OA. No.
 �
    11 Q. -- Marshall?
 �
     12 A. No. Not personally, not myself; just my
  �
    113 husband.
     14 Q. Do you have a separate e-mail from him?
  �
     15 A. No.
  �
     16 Q. All right. Did you have any discussions with
  �
    17 your husband or his Uncle Tom with regard to the
    18 $140.00 or $100.00 an acre delay rental negotiations
    119 that went on that we covered?
     20 A. The only conversation that I recall vaguely is
  �
    21 that, when the initial contract was being negotiated
    22 for the $100.00, he had inquired about asking for a
    23 little bit more to -- I don’t recall what the specific
    24 amount was. But to my understanding, the rely back

```

`Page 15` I
```
     1 was no.
     2 Q. Okay. So suffice to say you knew there was
  �
     3 going to be some attempt to see if additional amounts
     4 could be -- if a higher figure could be received for
     5 the lease, but the response from the oil company was
     6 no?
     7 A. (Nodding affirmatively.)
  �
     8 Q. 100 bucks was it?
  �
     9 A. Yes. That’s what they did say.
  �
     10 Q. All right. We talked about all that you can
  �
    11 recall of the conversation that you had with
    12 Mr. Marshall; correct?
     13 A. Yes.
  �
     14 Q. You had no other conversations with anybody
  �
    15 from the oil company?
     16 A. Huh-uh. No.
  �
     17 Q. Okay. Did you ever have any discussions with
  �
    18 Uncle Tom about this?
     19 A. No.
  �
     20 Q. Did you have any discussions with anybody
  �
    21 about this lease other than your lawyers?
     22 A. No.
  �
     23 Q. And the signatures that appeared on the lease,
