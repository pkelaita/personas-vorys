6 CROSS-EXAMINATION
7 BY MR. GROEDEL:
8 Q Doctor, can you please state your name for the
9 record.
10 A William C. Becker.
11 Q Dr. Becker, my name is Marc Groedel. I
12 represent Dr. Gallagher. I'm going to ask you
13 some questions today about the opinions that
14 you hold in this matter.
15 I assume you have been deposed before?
16 A Yes.
17 Q So because we're doing this via Zoom, we might
18 have a few glitches along the way. I would
19 just ask that to the extent that you can, wait
20 for me to finish my question before you start
21 giving your answer, and I will try to do
22 likewise. If at any point in time, though, I
23 end up interrupting you inadvertently before
24 you finish your answer, please let me know,
25 okay?
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

5
1 A Okay.
2 Q You understand that my purpose here today is
3 to explore and have you identify all of the
4 standard of care criticisms you have of
5 Dr. Gallagher; you understand that?
6 A Yes.
7 Q I assume you understand that you're under oath
8 and you understand the implications of that
9 oath, correct?
10 A Correct.
11 Q Where are you now?
12 A I am in New Haven, Connecticut.
13 Q Is anybody with you in the room?

24 fair enough?
25 A Fair.
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

6
1 Q If you need to take a break for any reason,
2 let me know, I'm sure we'll be able to
3 accommodate you. The only thing that I would
4 ask is if there is a question pending, you
5 answer the question and you can then go ahead
6 and take the break. You can take a break for
7 any reason; understood?
8 A Understood.
9 Q All right. Very good. Doctor, I have a copy
10 of the report that you wrote in this case
11 that's dated November 27, 2020; is that the
12 only report that you have written in this
13 case?
14 A That's the final report.
15 Q Are there any other reports that you have
16 written?
17 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection.
18 Q You can answer.
19 A No.
20 MR. GROEDEL: Mark, are you the
21 screen?
22 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: I'm on this screen
23 here. Can you see me, as well?
24 MR. GROEDEL: I just wasn't sure if
25 you were hooked in as well.
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.

7
1 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: I'm turning here to
2 the right, that's why I might not show up.
3 MR. GROEDEL: Very good.
4 BY MR. GROEDEL:
5 Q Doctor, you have identified a number of
6 materials that you reviewed in your report of
7 November 27. Have you reviewed any additional
8 information since writing your report?
9 A No.
10 Q Is there any other information that you have
11 requested that you don't have that you think
12 you need to have in order to testify at trial?
13 A No.
14 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: I also sent him the
15 expert reports, all the expert reports, all
16 the defendants.
17 Q So you've received the expert reports that
18 were authored by physicians who are testifying
19 on behalf of the defendants?
20 A Yes.
21 Q Do you know any of those physicians either
22 personally or by way of reputation?
23 A No.
24 Q While you were reviewing the materials for
25 this case, did you prepare any notes of any
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

8
1 kind?
2 A No.
3 Q Doctor, your business address is what?
4 A It is there on the top of my report. It
5 should be 950 Campbell Avenue, West Haven,
6 Connecticut.
7 Q What sort of building, is that a hospital, is
8 that a free-standing office building, what is
9 that?
10 A That's a hospital.
11 Q Is that where your main office is located?
12 A Yes, that's correct.
13 Q Who is your employer?
14 A I have two employers. VA Connecticut Health
15 System and Yale School of Medicine.
16 Q So what are your responsibilities as an
17 employee of the VA Connecticut Health Care
18 System?
19 A I am the Medical Director of a clinic and I
20 run a number of research studies.
21 Q What are your responsibilities as an employee
22 of Yale?
23 A To run other research studies.
24 Q What you just told me, does that encompass all
25 of the professional work that you do?
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

9
1 A I do additionally teach medical students and
2 residents as part of both of those roles.
3 Q Both as an employee of VA Connecticut Health
4 and the Yale School?
5 A Correct.
6 Q We have been provided with a copy of your CV.
7 Did you bring a copy of that with you?
8 A Yes.
9 Q The CV that I have is 24 pages and the last
10 article or reference is number 126; is that an
11 up-to-date CV?
12 A Yes.
13 Q Are there any changes, additions, corrections
14 that you believe you need to make?
15 A I don't believe so.
16 Q So what I would like to do now is talk to you
17 a little bit or have you tell me a little bit
18 about your current practice, what it entails
19 professionally.
20 A My clinical practice is running a multi
21 disciplinary pain clinic at the VA Hospital,
22 where we help individuals, we treat
23 individuals with chronic pain, which sometimes
24 also have opiate addiction.
25 Q Well, is that the extent of your clinical
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

10
1 practice?
2 A I also serve as a teaching attending physician
3 on the inpatient hospital wards for four weeks
4 a year.
5 Q Where is that at?
6 A At West Haven VA.
7 Q So your clinical practice entails running the
8 pain clinic, and then serving as an attending
9 on the inpatient service several weeks out of
10 the year?
11 A Yes.
12 Q So do you see patients in an outpatient basis,
13 in an office basis?
14 A Yes.
15 Q Describe for me when you see patients on an
16 outpatient basis.
17 A That's the multi-disciplinary pain clinic runs
18 in an outpatient setting.
19 Q How many days a week do you work at that
20 outpatient clinic?
21 A One.
22 Q What day of the week is that?
23 A Tuesday.
24 Q So on Tuesday what are you doing during that
25 day?
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

11
1 A I am seeing patients and discussing patients
2 with my colleagues, making treatment decisions
3 and implementing them.
4 Q About how many patients do you believe that
5 you see in direct care on a hands-on basis on
6 that Tuesday?
7 A Usually approximately 12 to 20.
8 Q What do you do on Monday?
9 A The research studies that I am involved with.
10 Q What actually is entailed with these research
11 studies? What are you doing?
12 A Well, every research project has pretty
13 standard set of phases from designing the
14 research, writing up the manuals of
15 procedures, then carrying out the research,
16 collecting data, analyzing data, and then
17 publishing the data. So with approximately
18 ten projects ongoing, variety of those in a
19 different stage of completion, basically
20 seeing them through at their various stages to
21 completion.
22 Q On that Monday are you providing any clinical
23 care to patients?
24 A If there is a phone call that it is urgent
25 that no one else is able to help with, I will
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

12
1 sometimes get involved in a clinical case, but
2 that's not necessarily scheduled and could or
3 could not be the case on any given Monday.
4 Q Fair to say then that the vast majority of
5 your time on Monday is spent with handling
6 your research projects as opposed to actually
7 seeing patients?
8 A Correct.
9 Q So what do you do on Wednesday?
10 A Research projects.
11 Q Same thing that you were doing on Monday?
12 A Correct.
13 Q And the same limited, if any, involvement with
14 actual hands-on clinical care?
15 A Correct.
16 Q What do you do on Thursday?
17 A Research projects.
18 Q Same thing as Wednesday?
19 A Yes.
20 Q What about Friday?
21 A Friday we do have a team, a clinical team
22 huddle that lasts an hour, and we make sure
23 that there were -- if there were any events
24 that happened since our Tuesday clinic that
25 need to be addressed, we decide who is going
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

13
1 to manage them; but other than that hour
2 clinical huddle, I'm also working on research
3 projects.
4 Q If it's an eight hour day, one hour is spent
5 with that team clinical huddle that discusses
6 patients who are seen in the clinic?
7 A Yes.
8 Q And the remainder of that day is spent with
9 the research that you have already described?
10 A Yes.
11 Q Do you have any professional responsibilities
12 on either Saturday or Sunday?
13 A Well, I'm generally catching up with grant
14 writing and writing up manuscripts, but there
15 are no structured hours doing that.
16 Q And the same would be true on Sunday?
17 A Correct.
18 Q So I assume there is no hands-on clinical care
19 that you provide on either Saturday or Sunday?
20 A Correct. Unless it's during my four weeks of
21 inpatient hospital work.
22 Q What percentage of your professional time
23 would you say is involved handling
24 administrative responsibilities for the
25 various projects that you are involved in?
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

14
1 A I'm not sure if you're trying to separate out
2 the administrative responsibilities of those
3 projects, or that was just meant to mean
4 research in general; but my professional
5 effort is split 20 percent clinical, 80
6 percent research.
7 Q The 20 percent clinical, that would involve
8 the Tuesday that you're seeing patients?
9 A Yes.
10 Q The 80 percent research is what you already
11 told us about?
12 A Yes.
13 Q Are you saying then that you have some
14 administrative responsibilities within that 80
15 percent research?
16 A Yeah. I mean, I'm responsible for making sure
17 that the reports get back to the NIH and
18 things are being accounted for in the way they
19 need to, to show productivity, so yes.
20 Q So limiting your answer to your research
21 responsibilities, what percentage of your time
22 would you say is devoted to administrative
23 functions?
24 A 20 percent of the research effort.
25 Q I assume you know what Dr. Gallagher does for
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

15
1 a living?
2 A Yes.
3 Q Have you ever worked as a primary care
4 physician like Dr. Gallagher?
5 A Not in a community setting, no.
6 Q Well, have you ever worked as a primary care
7 physician at all?
8 A Yes.
9 Q In what respect?
10 A I was a primary care physician at the
11 Philadelphia VA from 2007 to 2009.
12 Q Would that have been the extent of your
13 experience as a primary care physician?
14 A No. I was also a primary care physician when
15 I returned to Yale from 2007 to 2012.
16 Q Anything else?
17 A No, that's all.
18 Q So tell me what sort of work you did and where
19 you did it as a primary care physician when
20 you were in Philadelphia?
21 A I was managing a panel of approximately 800
22 patients with their adult medical problems
23 full time at the Philadelphia VA.
24 Q You were employed by the VA at that time?
25 A Correct.
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

16
1 Q So were you working like in a big office or
2 out of a VA Medical Center? Explain that to
3 me.
4 A Yeah. Multi physician practice, 15 to 20
5 full-time internists out of the VA.
6 Q What about your work at Yale from 2009 to
7 2012, explain that for me.
8 A There I was teaching faculty, so I had my own
9 panel of patients; but I was also supervising
10 residents with their panel of patients.
11 Q Did you actually provide hands-on care to
12 patients while you were at Yale?
13 A Yes.
14 Q During that period of time?
15 A Yes.
16 Q How often were you doing that, roughly?
17 A Two and a half days a week.
18 Q About how often were you providing direct
19 hands-on care to patients when you were
20 working as a primary care physician in
21 Philadelphia?
22 A Seven half days a week.
23 Q I'm sorry?
24 A Seven half days a week.
25 Q So just tell us a little bit about the pain
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

17
1 clinic that you are working at now. What sort
2 of services does it provide, what type of
3 patients do you see?
4 A We take referrals from primary care providers
5 throughout VA Connecticut of their patients
6 who are struggling with chronic pain that have
7 not responded well to first line treatment.
8 So we get involved to add diagnostic expertise
9 and to try to match patients with improved
10 treatments to help them do better.
11 Q Are there physicians besides internal medicine
12 folks that work at this clinic?
13 A Yes.
14 Q What are the other specialists that work at
15 this clinic?
16 A We have a psychiatrist who works with me.
17 Q Anybody else?
18 A There are trainees who also rotate through us,
19 physician trainees, some of whom are
20 internists, some are psychiatrists; but the
21 only other attending level physician is a
22 psychiatrist.
23 Q So this clinic that you have been referring to
24 where you see patients on Tuesdays, there is
25 two attending physicians that work at this
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

18
1 clinic?
2 A Yes.
3 Q What's the role of the psychiatrist?
4 A Well, many of the patients we see have
5 co-occurring psychiatric disorders that's
6 complicating their chronic pain, and she helps
7 weigh in on optimizing their care plans.
8 Q If you have a patient at your clinic that you
9 think would benefit from medication assisted
10 therapy, such as methadone or Suboxone, do you
11 provide that sort of treatment at your clinic?
12 A We provide Suboxone. We can't -- well, we are
13 not allowed to prescribe methadone for opiate
14 use disorder, but we do refer patients to the
15 opioid treatment program to do so, but we do
16 provide Suboxone.
17 Q I assume you don't provide methadone because
18 you got to have special license from the
19 government to utilize that medicine?
20 A Correct.
21 Q The psychiatrist that works with you, is that
22 psychiatrist capable of recognizing when a
23 patient has an addiction disorder?
24 A Yes.
25 Q An opioid use disorder?
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

19
1 A Yes.
2 Q Is that a skill that most or if not all
3 psychiatrists have or should have?
4 A So I heard two different questions. That they
5 have or that they should have. I would say
6 not all of them -- most don't have it, but
7 most should have it.
8 Q Why do you say that?
9 A Well, the data shows that a majority of
10 psychiatrists don't feel comfortable
11 diagnosing addiction, but if they're taking
12 care of patients who have mental health
13 issues, addiction is very commonly
14 co-occurring, so they probably should gain
15 comfort with that.
16 Q Would you agree that most psychiatrists are
17 sufficiently skilled to recognize when a
18 patient might have an opioid use disorder or
19 an addiction disorder?
20 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but can
21 answer.
22 A Most physicians skilled? Yes.
23 Q I know you have written a number of articles
24 and have spoken on opioid use disorder. I'm
25 just wondering whether there are any
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

20
1 particular articles, one or more, that you
2 plan on citing to a trial to support the
3 opinions you plan on offering?
4 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
5 can answer.
6 A I have not made any plan to do that, any
7 particular articles.
8 Q Recognizing that you're well-versed in the
9 field, as you sit here today, you don't plan
10 on citing to any specific article that you
11 have written to support your opinions at
12 trial; is that correct?
13 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
14 may answer.
15 A I haven't made that plan. I may end up doing
16 that, but as I sit here today, I haven't made
17 a plan to do that.
18 Q Well, I mean, this is my one and only chance
19 to find out exactly what you're going to say
20 and why you're going to say it prior to trial,
21 so that's why I am asking the question; but
22 without waiving any objection that I might
23 have to what you may end up telling us later
24 on, I would ask that if you do plan on citing
25 to any of your specific writing to support
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

21
1 your opinions at trial, that you let
2 Mr. Abramowitz know as soon as possible so
3 that he can advise the rest of us about that,
4 okay?
5 A Okay.
6 Q Thank you. Can you give me an idea as to
7 approximately how many hours you have spent
8 reviewing records, depositions, and other
9 materials in this case?
10 A Approximately 12 to 15 hours.
11 Q Do you have any billing records that would
12 reflect what you billed Mr. Abramowitz thus
13 far?
14 A I do not have them all pulled together at this
15 time.
16 Q Would you be able to do that for us and send
17 them to him so that he can send them to us?
18 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Mr. Groedel, I'll
19 take care of that.
20 MR. GROEDEL: Thank you.
21 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: No problem.
22 Q I want to ask you a few questions about your
23 prior experience in medical malpractice
24 litigation.
25 Can you tell me approximately how many
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

22
1 other times you have been involved as an
2 expert in a medical malpractice case?
3 A Three prior times, so this is my fourth.
4 Q Those three prior times, can you tell me
5 whether they were on behalf of the family or
6 plaintiff bringing the case, or the defendant
7 medical provider?
8 A Twice with the plaintiff, once with the
9 defendant.
10 Q Were all three of these cases involving
11 narcotic usage?
12 A Yes.
13 Q What's your charge for reviewing records and
14 depositions?
15 A My charges for case review is $400 an hour,
16 and depositions $500 an hour.
17 Q Besides this case, have you given a deposition
18 in a medical malpractice case?
19 A Yes.
20 Q How many times?
21 A This will be my third time.
22 Q The two other times, were they for defendant
23 medical providers or plaintiffs?
24 A One plaintiff, one defendant.
25 Q Have you testified in trial before?
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

23
1 A No.
2 Q What do you charge for trial testimony?
3 A Looking up my fee schedule here. $5,000 per
4 day, plus travel expenses.
5 Q You say you got a formal fee schedule?
6 A Yes.
7 Q Would you send a copy of that to
8 Mr. Abramowitz so that he can send that along
9 to us; do you have any problem with that?
10 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: We have no problem
11 with that. We'll get that to you, Marc.
12 MR. GROEDEL: Thank you.
13 Q Are you scheduled to testify at the trial of
14 this matter?
15 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
16 can answer.
17 A I have not been scheduled, but I'm willing to
18 do so.
19 Q Besides this case, are there any other cases
20 that you have reviewed either for the DiCello
21 firm or for Mr. Stombaugh?
22 A No.
23 Q To your knowledge, are you on the roster of
24 any company that advertises its ability to
25 find expert witnesses?
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

24
1 A No.
2 Q I assume you don't advertise your services as
3 an expert witness?
4 A Correct.
5 Q How did the DiCello firm find you to review
6 this case?
7 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
8 can answer.
9 A I actually don't know. I don't know.
10 Q Do you recall how you were contacted, was it
11 by telephone, email, letter, in person?
12 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
13 can answer.
14 A I don't recall.
15 Q When you were reviewing the records in this
16 case, would I be correct in assuming that you
17 were aware that Mr. Dukeshire had died?
18 A You would be correct.
19 Q Would I be correct in assuming that when you
20 were reviewing these records, you knew that he
21 had died from narcotics?
22 A Yes.
23 Q Or illicit drugs?
24 A Yes.
25 Q We know from the records we received in
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

25
1 discovery that Mr. Dukeshire received
2 narcotics from other physicians before he came
3 under the care of Dr. Gallagher; I assume you
4 were aware of that?
5 A Yes.
6 Q Do you know which physicians provided
7 Mr. Dukeshire with narcotics prior to him
8 becoming a patient of Dr. Gallagher's?
9 A The names of those physicians you are asking?
10 Q Yes.
11 A No. I saw them in the record but I didn't
12 commit them to memory.
13 Q Sure. Well, these were physicians I believe
14 who are affiliated with Family Health Services
15 of Erie County, and you mentioned them as one
16 of the records that you reviewed, correct?
17 A Yes.
18 Q Do you believe that any of the physicians that
19 prescribed narcotics to Mr. Dukeshire before
20 he came to see Dr. Gallagher breached the
21 standard of care in providing those narcotics?
22 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
23 can answer.
24 A I don't believe I have a complete set of
25 records to be able to comment on their meeting
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

26
1 or not meeting the standard of care.
2 Q Well, assuming that you have received all of
3 the records from Family Health Services of
4 Erie County that exist, do you have an opinion
5 as to whether or not those physicians provided
6 care that met the standard of care when they
7 prescribed narcotics for Mr. Dukeshire?
8 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection. I'm not
9 sure that's a fair assumption here. We just
10 don't know that at this time, if we have all
11 the records or not.
12 Q Do you have an opinion?
13 A No.
14 Q Is there anything that you saw in the Family
15 Health Services record that caused you to
16 think gee, I don't have all of the records
17 from this office?
18 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection.
19 A I'm sorry. Was there anything in those
20 records that made we wonder whether I might
21 not have all the records?
22 Q Correct.
23 A I can't answer that.
24 Q As you sit here today, you are not prepared to
25 state that the doctors at Family Health

27
1 Services breached the standard of care; is
2 that correct?
3 A That's correct.
4 Q Were you aware from the records that the
5 family had reported to medical providers in
6 2010 that Mr. Dukeshire had a history of
7 polysubstance abuse?
8 A Yes.
9 Q What was your understanding as to what was
10 being abused?
11 A Cocaine and alcohol.
12 Q Not narcotics?
13 A I don't recall opioids being a piece of that.
14 Q So I assume you were aware that in 2011 and
15 2012 Mr. Dukeshire was being treated with
16 narcotics for back pain, correct?
17 A Correct.
18 Q To your knowledge, were those physicians aware
19 of Mr. Dukeshire's history of prior cocaine
20 and alcohol abuse?
21 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection. Calls for
22 speculation.
23 MR. GROEDEL: No, it doesn't. It
24 calls for him to give an answer based upon the
25 records.
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

28
1 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Of what they knew or
2 did not know, it's more than what's in the
3 records, so I think it is speculation. You
4 didn't ask what's in those records, you asked
5 what they knew. I think those are different.
6 I think that's speculation.
7 Q Based upon the records that you reviewed, were
8 the physicians who were treating Mr. Dukeshire
9 in 2011 and 2012 aware of Mr. Dukeshire's
10 history of cocaine and alcohol abuse?
11 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
12 can answer.
13 A I'm not sure.
14 Q Based upon the records that you have seen, was
15 there any evidence that the physicians at
16 Family Health Care followed the guidelines of
17 the Ohio Administrative Code with respect to
18 the use of narcotics?
19 A I'm not sure.
20 Q You couldn't tell from the records one way or
21 the other?
22 A Correct.
23 Q What's your understanding as to what opioids
24 Mr. Dukeshire received from the doctors at
25 Family Health Care?
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

29
1 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
2 can answer.
3 A I do not recall.
4 Q From your review of those records, could you
5 tell whether or not the narcotics that he
6 received from that facility alleviated his
7 pain?
8 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
9 can answer.
10 A I'm not sure.
11 Q Is there evidence in the records at Family
12 Health Care that in 2012 Mr. Dukeshire was
13 referred to a pain management specialist?
14 A I'm not sure.
15 Q If he had been referred to a pain management
16 specialist at that point in time, and we're
17 talking about May of 2012, would that have
18 been an appropriate referral?
19 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
20 can answer.
21 A I can speak in the general sense that if
22 someone's primary care group or primary care
23 provider is hoping to get expert opinion, that
24 referral to an expert is appropriate.
25 Q What do pain management physicians do?
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

30
1 A Well, in general help, use their expertise,
2 diagnostic and treatment expertise to improve
3 the patient's pain and functioning.
4 Q Do they utilize methadone or Suboxone?
5 A Well, so methadone, as you may be aware, can
6 be used for the treatment of pain, as well as
7 the treatment of opioid use disorder. So some
8 pain specialists do use methadone for the
9 treatment of pain. Increasingly, pain
10 specialists are getting themselves trained in
11 the use of Suboxone, but that's a more recent
12 phenomenon I would say.
13 Q I would assume that pain management physicians
14 would be particularly adept at recognizing
15 when a patient may be addicted to narcotics?
16 A You said you can assume that, so are you
17 asking me if I have that same assumption?
18 Q Yes.
19 A I don't have that same assumption.
20 Q You don't believe pain management physicians
21 are capable of determining when a patient may
22 have an addiction disorder?
23 A Some are capable. They are all capable. Some
24 are adept, which is the word you used, and
25 some are not.
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

31
1 Q You would agree that a pain management
2 physician generally would be capable of
3 recognizing when a patient should be referred
4 to an addiction medicine specialist?
5 A Yes.
6 Q Do you know whether or not Mr. Dukeshire saw a
7 pain management specialist in May of 2012 or
8 thereabouts?
9 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
10 can answer.
11 A I'm not sure.
12 Q Were you aware that a tox screen from Bellevue
13 Hospital in October of 2012 was positive for
14 methadone and cocaine?
15 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
16 can answer.
17 A No, I was not.
18 Q Assuming that that tox screen was accurate,
19 where would somebody like Mr. Dukeshire be
20 able to access methadone?
21 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
22 can answer.
23 A He could have gotten it as a pain management
24 prescription, he could have gotten it from the
25 streets, or he could have gotten it from an
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

32
1 opioid treatment program.
2 Q Do you have any knowledge as to where he would
3 have received methadone?
4 A No.
5 Q If a physician saw that tox screen result, in
6 other words, the result that was positive for
7 methadone or cocaine, should that physician
8 have referred Mr. Dukeshire to an addiction
9 medicine specialist?
10 A Well, you know, a little more context would be
11 necessary to fully answer that, but illicit
12 cocaine use would very often generate, me to
13 generate a referral to addiction specialists.
14 Q What was your understanding from everything
15 you know about this case as to when
16 Mr. Dukeshire was using cocaine?
17 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
18 can answer.
19 A That it was prior to -- well, the only
20 documentation of it was that it was prior to
21 him joining Dr. Gallagher's practice.
22 Q Do you have any information to indicate that
23 he was using cocaine at all after he was with
24 Dr. Gallagher?
25 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

33
1 can answer.
2 A I have no indication of that.
3 Q I mean do you have any reason to believe that
4 he was utilizing cocaine from when he started
5 treating with Dr. Gallagher?
6 A Well, there's a history of use of cocaine and
7 we have no urine drug test during his time
8 with Dr. Gallagher, so it's certainly possible
9 but we have no way to know.
10 Q Based upon everything that you have seen in
11 this case, is there any evidence that you saw
12 that Mr. Dukeshire was suffering any adverse
13 effects from the opioids that he was receiving
14 in 2010, 2011, 2012, or 2013 before he began
15 treating with Dr. Gallagher?
16 A I don't know.
17 Q What information would you need to have, if
18 you think there is information out there, that
19 might allow you to answer that question?
20 A I would need to re-review the records from
21 that practice.
22 Q When was the last time you looked at the
23 records in this case?
24 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
25 can answer.
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

34
1 A Those particular records or any records?
2 Q Any records?
3 A Yesterday.
4 Q What records did you review yesterday?
5 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
6 can answer.
7 A I focused on Dr. Gallagher's records.
8 Q Any other records?
9 A Hospitalization records.
10 Q While Mr. Dukeshire was under Dr. Gallagher's
11 care?
12 A Yes.
13 Q When is the last time you looked at the
14 records from Family Health Services of Erie
15 County?
16 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
17 can answer.
18 A When they were first sent to me. I would
19 have -
20 Q Which was when?
21 A I am not sure.
22 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection. You can
23 answer.
24 A I'm not sure off the top of my head.
25 Q Well, your report is dated November 27, 2020,
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

35
1 does that provide you with any guidance as to
2 when you would have reviewed those records?
3 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
4 can answer.
5 A Before then.
6 Q Well, yeah. You didn't really help me much
7 with that one, Doctor.
8 Can you be anymore definitive than
9 that?
10 A I would say roughly approximately three to six
11 months before then.
12 Q Do you have an understanding as to the length
13 of time in which Mr. Dukeshire was using
14 cocaine?
15 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
16 can answer.
17 A No, I don't.
18 Q So if somebody is using cocaine, does the
19 length of time and the frequency with which
20 they use it need to be considered before you
21 determine whether or not they are actually
22 addicted to it?
23 A Length of time and frequency are factors, but
24 ultimately it is how much impact the use of
25 the substance is having on their ability to
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

36
1 function in a normal life.
2 Q Do you have any knowledge as to whether or not
3 Mr. Dukeshire's cocaine usage was having an
4 adverse impact upon his ability to function?
5 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
6 can answer.
7 A I don't.
8 Q To your knowledge, did Mr. Dukeshire tell
9 Dr. Gallagher about his history of prior
10 cocaine use?
11 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, you can
12 answer.
13 A I don't believe that he did.
14 Q Is it your understanding that Mr. Dukeshire
15 had a history of alcohol addiction?
16 A Yes.
17 Q What's your understanding about that
18 condition?
19 A That it had resolved prior to him joining
20 Dr. Gallagher's practice.
21 Q Do you have an understanding as to how it
22 resolved?
23 A I don't remember.
24 Q Do you have an understanding as to how long he
25 had that addiction for?
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

37
1 A I don't remember.
2 Q Was it your understanding that Dr. Gallagher
3 made an attempt to obtain Mr. Dukeshire's
4 records from Family Health Care?
5 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
6 can answer.
7 A Yes.
8 Q Was it your understanding that those records
9 were ever sent to Dr. Gallagher?
10 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, you can
11 answer.
12 A I believe they were.
13 Q You believe they were?
14 A Yeah.
15 Q Upon what do you base that information?
16 I assume you are looking at something?
17 A Yeah. I thought I saw reference to it in his
18 records, but now I don't believe I -- I think
19 I am mistaken. I would need to go back and
20 check.
21 Q It's quite possible that although he asked for
22 them, he never received those records?
23 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
24 can answer.
25 A Okay. So what I'm -- I am not certain that he
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

38
1 asked for them, and I am not certain that he
2 received them.
3 Q Is it true that the narcotics that
4 Mr. Dukeshire received prior to him starting
5 with Dr. Gallagher was to help control his
6 back pain?
7 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
8 can answer.
9 A I believe that's true.
10 Q Is back pain the most common reason why
11 narcotic medications are prescribed in this
12 country?
13 A I believe that's true.
14 Q What was your understanding as to how long
15 Mr. Dukeshire had been suffering from back
16 pain prior to his starting up with
17 Dr. Gallagher?
18 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection. You can
19 answer.
20 A I'd say my understanding was in the order of
21 years.
22 Q I saw some reference in the record to him
23 having a history of 20 years worth of back
24 pain, does that sound about right to you?
25 A Yes.
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

39
1 Q So if Mr. Dukeshire had been seen by a pain
2 management specialist in 2012 or 2013 before
3 he started with Dr. Gallagher, do you have an
4 opinion as to what treatment he likely would
5 have received at that point?
6 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
7 can answer.
8 A No.
9 Q Is there a possibility that if he had been
10 seen by a pain management specialist in 2012
11 or early 2013, he would have been referred to
12 an addiction medicine specialist?
13 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
14 can answer.
15 A Is there a possibility of that?
16 Q Yes.
17 A Yes.
18 Q Is there a probability of that?
19 A I don't know.
20 Q So I know that in your report you discuss the
21 presence of red flags with respect to
22 Mr. Dukeshire, and your opinion that
23 Dr. Gallagher didn't appropriately respond to
24 those red flags.
25 What I would like you to do now is to
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

40
1 identify for me each and every instance where
2 you believe a red flag was present or
3 occurring.
4 A Okay.
5 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: You want him to go
6 through the records one-by-one, look at each
7 visit, or the gestalt of it? How would you
8 like to handle that, rather than just -
9 MR. GROEDEL: Well, I mean, I want
10 him to identify each and every red flag. I
11 mean, you can do it -- the doctor can do it
12 any way he thinks would be the best way to
13 communicate his opinions to me on that issue.
14 I'll leave it to Dr. Becker.
15 A Okay. Well, some I can be a little more
16 specific in terms of dates, but others will be
17 more general in terms of concepts.
18 So one of the major red flag categories
19 that pops up a number of times is running out
20 early from -- his prescription running out and
21 asking for early refills, which I believe
22 started happening as early of April of 2014,
23 and then again June 2014, then July 2015,
24 August 2015, November 2015, April 2016, and
25 then again October 2017, which is right before

41
1 he died.
2 Q Let me stop you for a moment there.
3 Do you have an understanding as to
4 whether or not Mr. Dukeshire was having
5 increased complaints of pain beyond his usual
6 baseline on those occasions that caused him to
7 run out of his narcotics early?
8 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
9 can answer.
10 A I know on several of those instances
11 Mr. Dukeshire was complaining of increased
12 pain.
13 Q Are there occasions when patients on narcotics
14 take more than they should because they are
15 having more pain than what they are usually
16 dealing with?
17 A So the treatment agreement signed says that if
18 you are having increased pain, call us and we
19 can talk about what we can do. This issue of
20 escalating one's dose on one's own is really
21 concerning for loss of control; and I have no
22 doubt that Mr. Dukeshire reported pain as a
23 potential reason for doing this, but doesn't
24 make it safe or consistent with the treatment
25 agreement.
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

42
1 Q When you say treatment agreement, what
2 agreement are you referring to?
3 A Well, he signed a treatment agreement in
4 November of 2016.
5 Q Is it your belief that any one of these
6 episodes where he ran out early required
7 different action on the part of Dr. Gallagher
8 than what was provided?
9 A That any one required a different action?
10 Q Yes.
11 A It's my belief that any one of them pass maybe
12 the initial one, should have been reacted to
13 differently.
14 Q For instance, when he ran out early, for
15 instance, say in June of 2014, you believe
16 that episode should have warranted some action
17 on Dr. Gallagher's part?
18 A Correct. Correct.
19 Q What action do you believe was required?
20 A We really needed a urine drug test there to
21 see if this patient is taking what I am
22 prescribing and not taking things that I am
23 not prescribing.
24 Q Anything else?
25 A Definitely a query of the prescription drug
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

43
1 monitoring program to see if there were other
2 sources of medication.
3 Q I'm not sure I understood what you mean by
4 that.
5 A Checking the prescription drug monitoring
6 program.
7 Q You mean to see whether or not he was being
8 prescribed other narcotics or other
9 medications?
10 A Right.
11 Q Do you have an opinion based on reasonable
12 medical probability as to what a urine drug
13 screen would have shown if one had been
14 obtained in June of 2014?
15 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
16 can answer.
17 A No, I don't.
18 Q Do you have an opinion as to what a urine drug
19 screen would have shown beyond his narcotics
20 that he was being given by Dr. Gallagher at
21 any point in time prior to his death?
22 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: You asked -- I
23 apologize, Marc. Can you ask it again?
24 Q The idea behind a urine drug screen,
25 Dr. Becker, is to see whether or not the
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

44
1 patient is taking medications other than what
2 is being prescribed, correct?
3 A Well, taking -- A, taking what is being
4 prescribed; and B, making sure nothing that
5 isn't being prescribed is being taken.
6 Q Are you able to tell us that a urine drug
7 screen obtained at any time before
8 Mr. Dukeshire's death would have shown that he
9 was taking something beyond what Dr. Gallagher
10 was prescribing?
11 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
12 can answer.
13 A I think it's possible, but I can't say with
14 any certainty.
15 Q So just that we're clear here, you are unable
16 to state to within a reasonable degree of
17 medical probability that a urine drug screen
18 taken at any point in time before
19 Mr. Dukeshire's death, would have revealed
20 anything other than what Dr. Gallagher was
21 prescribing, correct?
22 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
23 can answer.
24 A With medical certainty?
25 Q Probability, yeah.
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

45
1 A So I would say that it wouldn't have surprised
2 me to find something other than what was being
3 prescribed.
4 Q It also wouldn't surprise you to see a urine
5 drug test that showed only the use of
6 narcotics being prescribed, correct?
7 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
8 can answer.
9 A If all had shown only what was being
10 prescribed, that would have been surprising.
11 Q At what point do you believe a urine drug
12 screen would have shown something other than
13 narcotics being prescribed by Dr. Gallagher?
14 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
15 can answer.
16 A It's hard to say. It's too hard to speculate.
17 Q Because it would be speculation to say that a
18 urine drug screen would have shown something
19 other than narcotics at any point in time
20 while Mr. Dukeshire was alive, correct?
21 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection.
22 A No.
23 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: You can answer.
24 A He's fairly clearly demonstrating symptoms of
25 the disease of opioid addiction. It's a
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

46
1 relapsing disease that causes periods of more
2 intense use than others. We don't have any
3 urine drug tests to look at so I could match
4 his varying points of acting more erratically
5 to say well, there could have been something
6 in his urine if it had been looked for; but to
7 say exactly when these times would be, I am
8 not prepared to do that.
9 Q Because it would be speculation?
10 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, you can
11 answer.
12 A I don't know how else to describe imagining
13 what the results of the urine tox would be
14 that was never drawn, but should have been.
15 Q Which is why you can't say a urine drug screen
16 would have shown something other than
17 narcotics, true?
18 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection. You've
19 asked and he answered already.
20 Q Are you thinking about it?
21 A No.
22 Q No what?
23 A No, I am not thinking about it.
24 Q Can you answer the question then?
25 A No.
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

47
1 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: I think he's saying
2 that he already answered it.
3 Q Beyond these running out early instances, are
4 there any other red flags that you believe
5 were present in Mr. Dukeshire's case that
6 warranted different action on the part of
7 Dr. Gallagher?
8 A Yes. There were at least three episodes where
9 it appeared Mr. Dukeshire had an episode of
10 drug toxicity, which could have been due to an
11 overdose of opioids, opioids plus
12 benzodiazepines. One in February 2016, one
13 June 2017, and then another in August 2017,
14 where various points he was confused, slurring
15 his speech, required admission to the
16 hospital; and these episodes are compared to,
17 as I mentioned, overdose, and if we're trying
18 to be thoughtfully prescribing these
19 medications, which we should be, a patient is
20 experiencing these sorts of symptoms, they
21 need to be really delved into, and it doesn't
22 appear that they were.
23 Q So you believe the episodes of February 2016,
24 June 2017, and August 2017 represented
25 overdoses?
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

48
1 A Yeah.
2 Q Which you believe were red flags?
3 A Right. The harms of this treatment are
4 outweighing any benefit, and it's really
5 concerning for the diseased patients -- well,
6 his prior ability to control his use of the
7 medication.
8 Q Any other red flags that you believe are
9 present in this case?
10 A Well, I think the fact that his family,
11 various members of his family are coming to
12 Dr. Dukeshire to explain their concern about
13 the way Mr. Dukeshire is using his medication,
14 the way he had been acting; that they had set
15 up various ways to help him count his
16 medication, keep track of his medication; and
17 even with those pretty concerted efforts they
18 weren't able to. That is a red flag for sure,
19 red flags, plural.
20 Q In what respect was Dr. Dukeshire -- I'm
21 sorry, Dr. Gallagher told that Mr. Dukeshire
22 was using his medications inappropriately by
23 family members?
24 A I believe the son had come to -- either come
25 in person or made a phone call to
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

49
1 Dr. Gallagher to express concern. The wife
2 phone called, and I think came in person; and
3 then a daughter, as well, made a phone call.
4 Q Did any of Mr. Dukeshire's family members tell
5 Dr. Gallagher that he was purchasing narcotics
6 on the street?
7 A I am not sure.
8 Q Did any of Mr. Dukeshire's family members tell
9 Dr. Gallagher that Mr. Dukeshire was
10 purchasing narcotics on the street, crushing
11 them, and snorting them?
12 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
13 can answer.
14 A Not that I am aware of.
15 Q Based on your review of the deposition
16 testimony, would it be fair to -- well, would
17 you agree that Mr. Dukeshire's family members
18 were aware that Mr. Dukeshire was purchasing
19 narcotics on the street?
20 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
21 can answer.
22 A I am not sure what they were aware of.
23 Q Didn't you read Mrs. Dukeshire's testimony
24 where she said that she knew that her husband
25 was purchasing narcotics from friends of his?
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

50
1 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
2 can answer.
3 A I did read that.
4 Q Are there any other red flags that you believe
5 are present in this case?
6 A Let's see. The early refills, the overdoses,
7 the family concern, family rationing his
8 medication. Oh, another one. This is a
9 general kind of category, it's hard to point
10 to specific instances, per se; but the over
11 time not pursuing other aspects of his medical
12 care and kind of focusing all his energy on
13 filling the medication often early, sort of
14 letting everything else to do with his health
15 and wellness just kind of go. That to me is a
16 big red flag that this person has developed an
17 addiction.
18 Q In other words, the patient's non compliance
19 with respect to other aspects of his medical
20 care to you is a red flag?
21 A Yeah. Or maybe as I put it or I will rephrase
22 it, a singular focus on getting the
23 medications at the exclusion of pursuing other
24 necessary medical care.
25 Q Any other red flags?

1 A I think those are the main ones I can recall
2 at this time.
3 Q In your report you make reference to the Ohio
4 Administrative Code, and I'm wondering what
5 specific code you are referring to?
6 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
7 can answer.
8 A I don't know that I have the actual title of
9 the code, but the Federation of State Medical
10 Boards developed a model policy for the use of
11 controlled substances. And Ohio -- that came
12 out in 2013 -- and Ohio adopted its own
13 version, as many states did, that was modeled
14 after the Federation's policy.
15 I was just going to say, it essentially
16 outlines best practices and the stewardship
17 and how to safely manage controlled substances
18 to be patient centered and safe.
19 Q Do you know when Ohio essentially in its
20 Administrative Code adopted the information in
21 the Federation of State Medical Boards?
22 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
23 can answer.
24 A I do not know off the top of my head. I would
25 have to do some digging.
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

52
1 Q Well, do you know whether or not the Ohio
2 Administrative Code set out guidelines that
3 were in effect when Mr. Dukeshire was under
4 the care of Dr. Gallagher?
5 A I believe so, yes.
6 Q You're just not sure exactly when?
7 A Correct.
8 Q Do you believe that the information and the
9 recommendations contained in the
10 Administrative Code are standard of care
11 requirements?
12 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
13 can answer.
14 A I guess I'm not sure standard of care
15 requirements? Establishing a standard of care
16 is how I would say.
17 Q Well, so for instance, if a physician didn't
18 follow any portion of the Administrative Code
19 guidelines, would you consider a lack of or
20 the absence of following those guidelines to
21 be a breach of the standard of care?
22 A Yes.
23 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Marc, I don't want to
24 rush you for a break, but we've been going for
25 about an hour here. Is it a good time for
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

53
1 one?
2 MR. GROEDEL: We can take a break
3 now if you would like. Ten minutes or so; is
4 that okay with you, Doctor?
5 THE WITNESS: Yes.
7 (Recess taken)
9 MR. GROEDEL: Doctor, we're back on
10 the record. Just a couple of minor cleanup
11 points that I forgot to follow up on.
12 Q With respect to medical literature, I assume
13 based on what you've told us previously, as
14 you sit here today, you don't plan on citing
15 to any medical literature beyond what you have
16 written; is that correct?
17 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, you can
18 answer.
19 A I would -- I have a number of thoughtful
20 colleagues in the field who have written
21 impactful things. I would like to reserve the
22 right to also present or reference their
23 material, but I haven't identified what those
24 might be.
25 Q Without waiving my objection to the late
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

54
1 identification of that literature, I would ask
2 that if you do identify any literature from
3 other folks beyond yourself, you identify that
4 literature for Mr. Abramowitz so he can let us
5 know about it?
6 A Yes.
7 MR. MCMANUS: I will second that
8 request also as it relates to my client Rite
9 Aid. Thank you.
10 A Yes.
11 Q You made reference, Doctor, to the treatment
12 agreement that Mr. Dukeshire signed during the
13 course of his treatment with Dr. Gallagher,
14 correct?
15 A Yes.
16 Q That's treatment agreements that are
17 frequently entered into between patients and
18 physicians when those patients are receiving
19 narcotics on a regular basis?
20 A Yes.
21 Q Based upon everything you know about this
22 case, would you agree that Mr. Dukeshire
23 violated that agreement on a number of
24 occasions?
25 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection. You can
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

55
1 answer.
2 A He violated it and Dr. Gallagher did too.
3 Q In what respect did Mr. Dukeshire violate that
4 agreement?
5 A I'm fairly certain the -- one of the lines
6 is -- asks that the patient not increase the
7 dose of the medication on their own, which the
8 patient did.
9 Q Does the agreement also obligate the patient
10 not to purchase narcotics outside of those
11 that are being prescribed by Dr. Gallagher?
12 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
13 can answer.
14 A I'm not sure I would agree that it obligates
15 the patient not to do that. My understanding
16 of these documents is that it says if this -
17 we advise you not to do that, we think that
18 would be unsafe, and if that is to happen,
19 we'll have to reconsider the appropriateness
20 of this treatment.
21 Q Wouldn't you agree that it would have been a
22 breach of the treatment agreement if
23 Mr. Dukeshire was purchasing narcotics from
24 friends or other people besides Dr. Gallagher;
25 that's a breach of the agreement, isn't it?
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

56
1 A That is a breach of the agreement. I'm trying
2 to put a point on your phrasing that it
3 obligates patients to do something. I don't
4 think it obligates patients to do anything.
5 It advises them.
6 Q It tells them things that they shouldn't be
7 doing, correct?
8 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
9 can answer.
10 A Tells them things that if they do, the
11 appropriateness of the treatment will be
12 reassessed.
13 Q Do you have an opinion as to what
14 Dr. Gallagher likely would have done had he
15 been told that Mr. Dukeshire was purchasing
16 narcotics on the street and then crushing them
17 and snorting them?
18 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
19 can answer.
20 A What Dr. Gallagher would have done? No, I
21 don't have an opinion. I -- no, I don't.
22 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: This is a speculation
23 of what Dr. Gallagher himself would do, or
24 what a prudent physician would do in that
25 situation?
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

57
1 MR. GROEDEL: I'm going to ask the
2 next question.
3 Q Do you have an opinion as to what
4 Dr. Gallagher should have done if he had been
5 told by anyone that Mr. Dukeshire was
6 purchasing narcotics on the street, crushing
7 them, and snorting them on a fairly regular
8 basis?
9 A What he should have done is made the diagnosis
10 of opioid use disorder with that information,
11 and then provided addiction treatment himself
12 to the patient, or provided a warm handoff to
13 a treatment facility, so that that treatment
14 facility could provide addiction treatment.
15 Q Are you able to state an opinion to within a
16 reasonable degree of probability as to whether
17 a referral to that sort of facility would have
18 avoided Mr. Dukeshire's death?
19 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, you can
20 answer.
21 A A referral with the appropriate, you know,
22 what I am saying a warm handoff, meaning the
23 provider that's on the other end of the
24 referral knows of the patient, knows when to
25 expect them. A meaningful way that the
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

58
1 patient can actually engage with the
2 treatment, yes, that could have prevented
3 Mr. Dukeshire's death.
4 Q So when you say could have prevented, are you
5 able to say to within a reasonable degree of
6 medical certainty that referral to an
7 addiction center would have in all likelihood
8 prevented Mr. Dukeshire's death?
9 A Well, referral to an addiction center, and
10 initiation of appropriate medication, yes.
11 Q Are you able to state to within a reasonable
12 degree of medical probability that
13 Mr. Dukeshire would have been compliant with
14 the treatment that would have been offered to
15 him at an addiction center?
16 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection.
17 Speculation. You can answer, if you can.
18 A I'm not going to speculate on that.
19 Q Are you saying that because it requires
20 speculation to give an answer?
21 A It is -- hum? I think it is within reasonable
22 certainty that he would have been compliant
23 with that treatment, yes.
24 Q Why do you believe he would have been
25 compliant with that treatment?
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

59
1 A Because he would recognize that his source of
2 opioids was going away and that he would need
3 to pursue this treatment to forestall going
4 into opiate withdrawal.
5 Q Did you see any evidence of Mr. Dukeshire
6 exhibiting signs of opiate withdrawal while he
7 was under Dr. Gallagher's care?
8 A I don't believe that I did.
9 Q I may have asked you this before, if so, I
10 apologize: Are you going to have an opinion at
11 trial as to whether or not Mr. Dukeshire
12 utilized heroin at any point in time prior to
13 his death?
14 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection. Other
15 than the fatal dose, I mean, we know that he
16 did that.
17 MR. GROEDEL: Well, no, we don't.
18 Q But go ahead.
19 A So sorry? Am I going to -- could you please
20 repeat the question?
21 Q Let me just start at this point: We know the
22 autopsy showed there was evidence of morphine
23 in the toxicology report, correct?
24 A Right.
25 Q Is it your opinion that that morphine was due
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

60
1 to the ingestion of heroin?
2 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
3 can answer.
4 A I mean, it could have been, but you clearly
5 know that already.
6 Q So you are saying it's something that could
7 have been part of what he ended up taking on
8 the day that he died?
9 A Yes.
10 Q Forgetting about that day for a moment, the
11 day that he died, is there any evidence that
12 Mr. Dukeshire utilized heroin?
13 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, you can
14 answer.
15 A Not that I am aware of, other than if a urine
16 toxicology was done, we would have had more
17 basis to comment.
18 Q We know from the records that Mr. Dukeshire
19 had two back surgeries performed in December
20 of '2014, correct?
21 A Correct.
22 Q I assume you saw from the records that he had
23 documented significant degenerative changes in
24 his lumbar spine, correct?
25 A Correct.
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

61
1 Q And he was having a lot of back pain as a
2 result?
3 A Correct.
4 Q I assume you don't have any criticisms of the
5 decision to go ahead and provide two
6 operations in an attempt to alleviate his back
7 pain, true?
8 A I'm not a surgeon. I am not going to comment
9 on that.
10 Q Surgeries don't always alleviate back pain,
11 true?
12 A That is true.
13 Q Why is that?
14 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection. If you
15 can answer.
16 A Well, the back is complicated physiologically,
17 muscles, ligaments, bones. The target that is
18 aimed at for surgical decompression can
19 sometimes be the source of the pain, and
20 sometimes not.
21 Q Was it appropriate for Mr. Dukeshire to
22 receive narcotic medication following these
23 two operations?
24 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
25 can answer.
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

62
1 A So limited two to three day supply for
2 incisional pain is appropriate, but beyond
3 that, typically not needed, so inappropriate.
4 Q We know from the records that Mr. Dukeshire's
5 back pain returned in May of 2015 when he was
6 complaining of severe radiating pain. Do you
7 have an opinion as to whether or not it was
8 appropriate to treat him with narcotics for
9 those complaints of back pain?
10 A It would have been appropriate to take a very,
11 very close look at whether the benefit of
12 doing that would have outweighed the risk.
13 And there is a number of things working
14 against him on the risk side of things that
15 would have ultimately led me to think it was
16 probably too risky and the benefit would be
17 fairly minimal.
18 Q Is it your opinion that it was beneath the
19 standard of care to prescribe narcotics for
20 Mr. Dukeshire when he had recurrent low back
21 pain in May of 2015?
22 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
23 can answer.
24 A I am not going to say beneath the standard of
25 care, no.
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

63
1 Q We know from the records that Mr. Dukeshire
2 also had a history of right knee infection and
3 abscesses; is that correct?
4 A Yes.
5 Q Is it your understanding that a draining
6 abscess can be painful?
7 A Yes.
8 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection. You can
9 answer.
10 Q We know from the records that in early 2015 he
11 needed to be hospitalized in Toledo for
12 further care for that knee abscess, correct?
13 A Yes.
14 Q Are you critical of the decision to treat him
15 with narcotics for the right knee pain he was
16 suffering from at that point?
17 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
18 can answer.
19 A No, I am not critical.
20 Q We know that he was readmitted to the hospital
21 in April of 2015 because his knee pain
22 returned. Are you critical of the decision to
23 treat him with narcotics once again during
24 that admission?
25 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

64
1 can answer.
2 A Not critical of the use during admission for
3 the drainage procedure, which is painful, a
4 couple days post procedure. Ongoing use would
5 have required more consideration, and again,
6 harms probably would have outweighed the
7 benefits in my opinion.
8 Q I assume you are aware that Mr. Dukeshire
9 required seven separate surgical procedures
10 for his right knee over about a three year
11 period of time; is that correct?
12 A That's correct.
13 Q And you would agree that those recurrent
14 infections would be a source of pain?
15 A Yes.
16 Q And would require narcotics?
17 A Again, the sort of a blanket "requiring
18 narcotics" is a tough -- it's hard to answer
19 in a blanket way. A couple days surrounding
20 the procedures makes a lot of sense, but
21 having a year's worth, less sense, because of
22 the, again, the declining benefit of taking
23 them and the increasing risks.
24 Q Did you have an understanding as to whether
25 the left knee infections in 2017 was keeping
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

65
1 Mr. Dukeshire from working at all?
2 A I do not recall if that was the reason for
3 keeping him out of work.
4 Q You would agree, though, that his recurrent
5 left knee infections were an ongoing source of
6 pain for him over the last few years of his
7 life?
8 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, you can
9 answer.
10 A Yes.
11 Q Would that abscess that required seven
12 surgical procedures over the course of a few
13 years, would that have an impact upon his
14 gait?
15 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
16 can answer.
17 A I'm not sure.
18 Q We also know from the records that
19 Mr. Dukeshire developed ulcers on his buttocks
20 while he was under Dr. Gallagher's care,
21 correct?
22 A Yes.
23 Q What is your understanding as to how those
24 ulcers developed, what caused them?
25 A Well, he did have an admission to the hospital
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

66
1 I believe in 2014, heavy man, I think he was
2 in ICU, he was on mechanical ventilation.
3 Sometimes these develop, start as pressure
4 ulcers, I think that is how this one started,
5 and then once they are established, then they
6 are often hard to resolve because of the extra
7 fat tissue. The antibodies don't penetrate
8 very well, et cetera, et cetera. So yeah, I
9 think it started with the hospitalization.
10 Q These ulcers, they can be painful?
11 A Yes.
12 Q And it would not be unreasonable to treat
13 ulcers like that with narcotics?
14 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
15 can answer.
16 A It's fairly atypical to treat those with
17 opioids. The main treatment is to drain them,
18 dress them, try to debride the dead tissue.
19 Not a lot of innervation back there on your
20 posterior buttocks with a lot of adipose
21 tissue there, while I did say it would be
22 painful, I'm not sure painful enough to
23 warrant extended courses of opioids.
24 Q Do you believe any of the physicians who
25 prescribed opioids to treat those ulcers
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

67
1 breached the standard of care?
2 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
3 can answer.
4 A So anybody who used those in a long term
5 fashion without doing appropriate monitoring
6 of what was going on with those opioids was
7 breaching the standard of care. I'm not going
8 to say the decision to use them at all was
9 below the standard of care, but the decision
10 to not follow up appropriately and monitor
11 was.
12 Q Were you aware that Mr. Dukeshire was seen by
13 a pain management specialist in February of
15 A Yes.
16 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection.
17 Q Based upon everything you know about this
18 case, did that pain management specialist
19 refer Mr. Dukeshire to an addiction
20 specialist?
21 A I am not certain.
22 Q Well, do you believe that that pain management
23 specialist should have referred Mr. Dukeshire
24 to an addiction specialist?
25 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

68
1 can answer.
2 A So the responsibility for how the opioids are
3 being monitored and the harm that may be
4 accruing from them is on the prescriber to
5 manage. And so I don't -- the referring pain
6 physician was not the prescriber, I don't
7 think it was their duty to do so.
8 Q You don't have any criticisms of the pain
9 management specialist if he didn't feel that
10 addiction referral was required, correct?
11 A Correct.
12 Q We know from the records that Mr. Dukeshire
13 was an inpatient at Elmwood Health Care Center
14 in May and June of 2014 for his wounds, you're
15 aware of that?
16 A Yes.
17 Q Would it have been appropriate to treat him
18 with narcotics for those wounds?
19 A Again, I would have recommended short courses
20 for a matter of several days while those
21 wounds were being debrided, but in terms of
22 ongoing long term treatment, not appropriate.
23 Q We know from the records that in July of 2015
24 Mr. Dukeshire was admitted to Firelands
25 Hospital for a large painful buttocks ulcer,
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

69
1 was it appropriate for him to be treated with
2 narcotics during that admission?
3 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
4 can answer.
5 A During the admission, yes.
6 Q We know that his buttocks ulcer flared up
7 again in July of 2017 and he was treated for
8 that problem at the Bethesda Care Center, was
9 it appropriate for him to be treated with
10 narcotics during that admission?
11 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
12 can answer.
13 A Yes, during the admission.
14 Q It looks like Mr. Dukeshire started having
15 pain related to carpal tunnel syndrome
16 sometime in 2015, did you notice that in the
17 records?
18 A Yes.
19 Q That's a painful condition?
20 A Yes.
21 Q Would it be appropriate to treat somebody with
22 narcotics for that condition?
23 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
24 can answer.
25 A No. Really the treatment of choice for carpal
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

70
1 tunnel syndrome is braces, non steriodal anti
2 inflammatory drugs, and exercises, physical
3 therapy, and ultimately surgery.
4 Q What is your understanding as to whether
5 Mr. Dukeshire had surgery for his carpal
6 tunnel symptoms?
7 A I'm not sure.
8 Q Would an MRSA infection of the wrist be a
9 painful condition?
10 A Possibly.
11 Q Could require narcotics, potentially?
12 A Could require narcotics, potentially?
13 Potentially, yes.
14 Q I also saw some reference to Mr. Dukeshire
15 having a left biceps tear; were you aware of
16 that?
17 A Yes.
18 Q What's your understanding as to how that
19 injury occurred?
20 A I believe this was during a period of time he
21 was repossessing cars. He might have gotten
22 in a scuffle.
23 Q Would that sort of injury be painful?
24 A Yes.
25 Q Might require narcotics?
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

71
1 A It might, but it might not.
2 Q I want to switch gears a little bit and ask
3 you some questions about Mr. Dukeshire's
4 medical conditions.
5 We know from the records that he had a
6 history of severe obstructive sleep apnea,
7 correct?
8 A Correct.
9 Q CPAP is the appropriate treatment for that?
10 A Yes.
11 Q Mr. Dukeshire had the CPAP device?
12 A I believe he did. He did possess one.
13 Q Is it your understanding that he was non
14 compliant with respect to the CPAP?
15 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
16 can answer.
17 A Yes, it is my understanding.
18 Q I mean, it's not all that unusual for patients
19 with obstructive sleep apnea to not use the
20 CPAP device because they find it very
21 uncomfortable, correct?
22 A Correct.
23 Q So from your understanding, Mr. Dukeshire's
24 sleep apnea was essentially untreated because
25 he wasn't using his CPAP device?
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

72
1 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
2 can answer.
3 A Yes.
4 Q What sort of symptoms can a patient exhibit if
5 they have sleep apnea that's not being
6 sufficiently treated with a CPAP device?
7 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
8 can answer.
9 A Daytime somnolence is the most -- you know,
10 daytime sleepiness is the most common symptom.
11 Q They can become drowsy while driving?
12 A Yes.
13 Q It can affect their memory and concentration?
14 A Yes.
15 Q The records indicate that Dr. Gallagher
16 referred Mr. Dukeshire for a sleep clinic
17 evaluation on two occasions, I assume you're
18 aware of that?
19 A Yes.
20 Q Is it your understanding that Mr. Dukeshire
21 failed to keep those appointments?
22 A Yes.
23 Q Does the record indicate that Dr. Gallagher on
24 a number of occasions spoke to Mr. Dukeshire
25 about the importance of using his CPAP device?
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

73
1 A Yes.
2 Q Do you have an opinion in this case as to what
3 likely would have happened had Mr. Dukeshire
4 seen a sleep clinic physician as Dr. Gallagher
5 had recommended?
6 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
7 can answer.
8 A Not going to comment outside my area of
9 specialty.
10 Q Do you have an opinion as to whether an
11 evaluation by a sleep medicine specialist
12 would have led to a change in his narcotic
13 dosage?
14 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
15 can answer.
16 A Hum? I don't know.
17 Q Possible?
18 A Possible.
19 Q Do you know what would be involved with a
20 sleep clinic evaluation for somebody with
21 obstructive sleep apnea?
22 A Yeah. Typically do an overnight polysomnogram
23 and assess how many apneic episodes the
24 patient is experiencing.
25 Q Regardless of the result, is the essential
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

74
1 treatment for this condition using the CPAP
2 device?
3 A Well, there are -- I mean, first of all,
4 there's a variety of masks that they can try.
5 There are others. CPAP is one version of
6 ventilation. There are a couple others that
7 are sometimes better tolerated by patients,
8 but positive airway pressure is the main
9 modality, that is true.
10 Q It looks like Mr. Dukeshire was actually
11 scheduled for a sleep study in March of 2017
12 and was a no show for that; you're aware of
13 that?
14 A Yes.
15 Q If Mr. Dukeshire was able to regularly use his
16 CPAP device, what impact would that have had
17 on his overall health?
18 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
19 can answer.
20 A Typically leads to better quality sleep,
21 overall improved sense of restfulness, which
22 does tend to help improve mood and even pain.
23 Q Lessens the amount of pain one would have?
24 A It can, yeah.
25 Q We of course know that Mr. Dukeshire was
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

75
1 morbidly obese, correct?
2 A Yes.
3 Q Does the record indicate that Dr. Gallagher on
4 multiple occasions talked to Mr. Dukeshire
5 about the importance of losing weight?
6 A Yes.
7 Q To your knowledge, did Mr. Dukeshire follow up
8 on any of these recommendations?
9 A Not to my knowledge.
10 Q Would a bariatric evaluation have been helpful
11 to Mr. Dukeshire?
12 A Yes, probably.
13 Q Were you aware that he failed to appear for a
14 bariatric evaluation that had been scheduled
15 for him?
16 A Yes.
17 Q So based upon the records that you have seen
18 and the deposition testimony that you have
19 seen, would you agree that while he was under
20 Dr. Gallagher's care, Mr. Dukeshire had a
21 number of different stressors in his life?
22 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
23 can answer.
24 A Yes, I would agree.
25 Q What was your understanding as to what
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

76
1 different stressors were going on in
2 Mr. Dukeshire's life while he was under
3 Dr. Gallagher's care?
4 A I think he was experiencing a failing business
5 and having financial stress due to that. He
6 was also experiencing family stress, some of
7 which was due to his irritable and labile
8 mood, which was probably related to opiate
9 addiction.
10 Q Any other stressors?
11 A I think there was some junior colleague at
12 work who was problematic in some way, form, or
13 another. I can't remember exactly what.
14 Q Mr. Dukeshire also had erectile dysfunction
15 that Viagra was not helping?
16 A Hum?
17 Q Were you aware of that?
18 A I may have forgotten, but I did see erectile
19 dysfunction as a diagnostic code in one of the
20 visits.
21 Q That would be a stressor in his life?
22 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
23 can answer.
24 A Probably, sure.
25 Q I saw from the records that Dr. Gallagher
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

77
1 started Mr. Dukeshire on Zoloft for depression
2 and anxiety in 2014, was that appropriate for
3 him to do?
4 A Yes.
5 Q What is your understanding as to why
6 Mr. Dukeshire was having issues with
7 depression and anxiety?
8 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
9 can answer.
10 A Probably a multitude of factors, not limited
11 to, but including, genetics, psychosocial
12 stressors, and substance use.
13 Q When you say genetics, what are you referring
14 to there?
15 A Genetic predisposition to have a mood
16 disorder.
17 Q Is it your understanding that Dr. Gallagher
18 had recommended to Mr. Dukeshire that he
19 follow up with a psychiatrist?
20 A Yes.
21 Q Doesn't look like he actually followed up with
22 a psychiatrist until just a couple weeks or so
23 before he died, right?
24 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
25 can answer.
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

78
1 A That's correct.
2 Q It looks like the psychiatrist that he saw was
3 a Dr. Travis, correct?
4 A Yes.
5 Q And based upon Dr. Travis' records, it looks
6 like he was aware of the fact that
7 Mr. Dukeshire was taking narcotics and was, in
8 fact, on a benzodiazepine as well, correct?
9 A Yes.
10 Q It doesn't look like Dr. Travis recommended
11 that he either stop the narcotics or wean off
12 of them, correct?
13 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
14 can answer.
15 A That's correct.
16 Q It looks like from the records that Dr. Travis
17 did, however, discuss the black box warning on
18 the use of narcotics and benzodiazepines,
19 correct?
20 A Correct.
21 Q What is your understanding as to the purpose
22 behind that black box warning?
23 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
24 can answer.
25 A Data showing that co-occurring use or
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

79
1 concurrent use of benzodiazepines and opioids
2 increases the risk of opioid overdose by
3 double.
4 Q Is that because of the synergistic effect of
5 using the two medicines at the same time?
6 A Yes.
7 Q According to the records it appears as though
8 Mr. Dukeshire denied the use of illicit drugs,
9 correct?
10 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
11 can answer.
12 A It does appear so, yes.
13 Q That would be an untruthful statement,
14 correct?
15 A Well, we're lacking some key pieces of data to
16 know whether he was using illicit drugs and
17 when.
18 Q Well, you would agree that purchasing
19 narcotics off the street, crushing them, and
20 snorting them, that would constitute using
21 illicit drugs, true?
22 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
23 can answer.
24 A Yes, that would constitute use of illicit
25 drugs.
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

80
1 Q Did Mr. Dukeshire give an untruthful response
2 when he was asked whether he was taking pain
3 pills that were not prescribed for him?
4 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
5 can answer.
6 A Yes.
7 Q So if he had given a truthful answer to that
8 question, do you believe that it would have
9 had an impact upon Dr. Travis' treatment
10 recommendations?
11 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
12 can answer.
13 A Yes.
14 Q In what way?
15 A It would have increased Dr. Travis' concern
16 for substance use disorder.
17 Q And likely would have caused him to recommend
18 referral to an addiction specialist?
19 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
20 can answer.
21 A Likely would have, yes.
22 Q Dr. Travis' diagnosis was major depressive
23 disorder. First of all, do you have any
24 reason to doubt that diagnosis?
25 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

81
1 can answer.
2 A No.
3 Q Do you have an opinion as to the cause of that
4 disorder?
5 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
6 can answer.
7 A Well, cause of major depressive disorder?
8 Hum? So again, usually a genetic
9 predisposition, and then psychodynamic factors
10 going on in one's life; but I will say in the
11 setting of an active substance use disorder,
12 which he was potentially experiencing, likely
13 experiencing, it's difficult to make a mood
14 disorder diagnosis.
15 Q So I am not sure I follow you there. What are
16 you trying to tell me?
17 A I guess my sense is if Dr. Travis had been
18 addiction trained, I don't know that he was, I
19 think he would have considered addiction a
20 little more thoroughly on a differential
21 diagnosis, would have probably also ordered a
22 urine drug test himself; but he was concerned
23 about mood disorder and I have already stated
24 I don't have any reason to doubt that that was
25 present.
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

82
1 Q But from what we can see from the records,
2 Dr. Travis didn't raise substance use disorder
3 as a potential diagnosis, correct?
4 A Correct.
5 Q It looks like he increased the patient's anti
6 depressants, the Lexapro, the Abilify; was
7 that an acceptable thing to do?
8 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
9 can answer.
10 A Yes.
11 Q Did you see any indication that Dr. Travis
12 said to Mr. Dukeshire stop taking the Valium?
13 A Gosh? I would have to review. I believe he
14 warned him about the black box interaction,
15 but I have to review for certainty; but I
16 don't believe he said frankly stop taking it.
17 Q Was either Dr. Travis or the therapist,
18 Mr. Seymour, who was seeing Mr. Dukeshire,
19 aware of the fact that Dr. Gallagher had
20 reduced Mr. Dukeshire's narcotic dosage at
21 around that time?
22 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
23 can answer.
24 A I'm not sure.
25 Q If they were aware of that, would that have
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

83
1 raised any red flags on their part with
2 respect to Mr. Dukeshire's potential need to
3 see an addiction medicine specialist?
4 A Oh, I'm not sure.
5 Q You would agree that Dr, maybe I asked you
6 this, but I apologize, Dr. Travis did not
7 diagnose opioid use disorder, correct?
8 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
9 can answer.
10 A I did not see that in the consultation note.
11 Q Do you believe it was within the standard of
12 care for Dr. Gallagher to be prescribing
13 Valium?
14 A No.
15 Q Are you aware of any physician who said that
16 narcotics and benzodiazepines should not be
17 prescribed concurrently?
18 A Am I aware of any physician who said that?
19 Q Yeah.
20 A I'm aware of physicians who say that should be
21 avoided whenever possible.
22 Q So you believe it was a breach of the standard
23 of care for Dr. Gallagher to prescribe a
24 benzodiazepine for Mr. Dukeshire?
25 A In this particular case, he was prescribing
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

84
1 opioids in an unmonitored way, he was not
2 recognizing the signs and symptoms of opioid
3 use disorder, so one should not be prescribing
4 opioids in that situation, much less
5 prescribing benzodiazepines and opioids. So
6 it's sort of a cascade of things one should
7 not be doing.
8 Q At what point do you believe the diagnosis of
9 opioid use disorder should have been made
10 according to the standard of care?
11 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
12 can answer.
13 A Once there was a clear pattern of loss of
14 control of the use of the medication, which I
15 would say was about a year into their
16 treatment relationship.
17 Q And you believe at that point that's when
18 there should have been a referral to an
19 addiction medicine specialist?
20 A Correct.
21 Q To your knowledge, did you see anyone document
22 Mr. Dukeshire suffering ill effects from the
23 concurrent use of narcotics and
24 benzodiazepines?
25 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

85
1 can answer.
2 A Documenting ill effects? Well, there were
3 documentation -- there is documentation of
4 delirium and other effects that very likely
5 could have been due to that combination.
6 People weren't necessarily recognizing those
7 as such, but they were documenting the
8 presence of those symptoms.
9 Q Did any doctor document those symptoms as
10 being potentially due to a combination of
11 narcotics and benzos?
12 A Not that I saw.
13 Q I assume you saw testimony from family members
14 about the family intervention that took place
15 when the family expressed their concern to
16 Mr. Dukeshire about his narcotic usage?
17 A Yes.
18 Q What is your understanding as to the outcome
19 of that?
20 A I don't believe it was effective.
21 Q In what respect was it not effective?
22 A He didn't -- it didn't result in him seeking
23 treatment.
24 Q Do you have an opinion as to why Mr. Dukeshire
25 chose not to follow up on the family's desires
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

86
1 that he seek treatment?
2 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
3 can answer.
4 A He was likely in denial.
5 Q Denial that he had a problem?
6 A Yes.
7 Q What is your understanding of the overall
8 success rate of methadone treatment?
9 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
10 can answer.
11 A Compared to no treatment, it reduces cravings
12 and return to drug use in about 75 percent of
13 individuals.
14 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Marc, just one
15 second. Somebody walking by that works here.
16 MR. GROEDEL: It is fuzzy, but it's
17 okay.
18 Q What is your understanding then as to why
19 there is a 25 percent rate where methadone
20 treatment is not successful?
21 A Patients -- well, few treatments are perfect,
22 and patients don't always respond; but
23 compared to many other medical interventions,
24 it's considered high rates of success.
25 Q What about Suboxone treatment, is the success
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

87
1 rate any different?
2 A It's about the same. Maybe a hair lower, but
3 still in the, you know, highly effective zone.
4 Q So those patients that receive initial success
5 from medication assisted treatment, is there a
6 significant percentage of those patients that
7 suffer relapses?
8 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
9 can answer.
10 A Significant? Sort of a tough word to try to
11 define for you. Some do, yes.
12 Q I have seen literature which indicates that 40
13 to 60 percent of recovering addicts will
14 suffer a relapse; does that sound accurate to
15 you?
16 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
17 can answer.
18 A I would put it lower than that.
19 Q How much lower?
20 A More like 15 to 30.
21 Q Is the relapse rate higher for those patients
22 who have used heroin in the past?
23 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
24 can answer.
25 A I don't know.
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

88
1 Q Is the success rate lower for those patients
2 who have a history of cocaine and alcohol
3 abuse?
4 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
5 can answer.
6 A I would say it is who had active, not
7 necessarily history of.
8 Q Did you have an understanding that towards the
9 last few months of Mr. Dukeshire's care,
10 Dr. Gallagher was tapering Mr. Dukeshire's
11 narcotic dosage downward?
12 A Yes, attempting to.
13 Q Well, he was prescribing a lower dose of
14 narcotic for him during the last few months of
15 his life, correct?
16 A Yes, although there were a couple instances, I
17 believe, where that was the intention and that
18 was what the prescription said, but then the
19 patient would use it faster and was given a
20 bridge prescription. So how much it was
21 actually lowered is less than what was
22 intended.
23 Q What is your understanding as to when a bridge
24 prescription was given?
25 A I would have to look back at the exact date.
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

89
1 Q How many times was it done?
2 A Over the whole treatment course?
3 Q Let's just say over the period of time when
4 the dosage was being tapered downward?
5 A In those last three months, I would say at
6 least once, and I think possibly twice.
7 Q If Dr. Gallagher didn't refer Mr. Dukeshire to
8 an addiction specialist in the Summer of 2017,
9 would it have been appropriate for him to
10 taper the narcotic dose, as he was doing?
11 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
12 can answer.
13 A The evidence based treatment for opiate
14 addiction, and by that I mean what we know
15 from the scientific literature works, is
16 getting the patient on medication. The new
17 term is medications for opioid use disorder,
18 it is not tapering, so you know, just tapering
19 is below the standard of care.
20 Q What else then was required?
21 A Getting an earnest actionable referral to an
22 addiction treatment center that could provide
23 medication for opioid use disorder. I should
24 remind us, prescribing it himself, which
25 primary care docs can do so with Suboxone.
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

90
1 Q Do you know whether or not Dr. Gallagher was
2 capable of managing somebody either on
3 Suboxone or methadone?
4 A Considering the fact that he wasn't capable of
5 diagnosing opioid use disorder, I would say
6 almost certainly not.
7 Q If a patient is going to receive methadone
8 treatment to treat an opioid use disorder,
9 does that treatment also involve therapy
10 sessions?
11 A It does. Most opiate treatment programs
12 require counseling, along with medication
13 administration.
14 Q How often are those counseling sessions
15 required?
16 A Varies from state to state, but usually in the
17 order of once or twice per month.
18 Q In this case if Mr. Dukeshire was receiving
19 methadone, are you able to state to within a
20 reasonable degree of probability that he would
21 have attended counseling sessions as required?
22 A I have no reason to believe that he would not
23 have.
24 Q And you say that, even though you would agree
25 that there were many aspects of
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

91
1 Mr. Dukeshire's care where he was non
2 compliant as a patient, correct?
3 A That's correct.
4 Q In fact, he missed a number of appointments
5 with Dr. Gallagher, correct?
6 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
7 can answer.
8 A He did.
9 Q Would you agree that he was also dismissed
10 from the Coumadin clinic because he failed to
11 show up for a number of scheduled
12 appointments?
13 A He was.
14 Q In your review of the records, did you see
15 that he missed numerous wound care clinic
16 appointments as well, correct?
17 A That is correct.
18 Q And of course, we've already talked about how
19 he failed to keep two appointments for sleep
20 study evaluations, true?
21 A That's true.
22 Q It looks like from the records that he had an
23 appointment for a colonoscopy and he failed to
24 keep that appointment also, correct?
25 A That's correct.
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

92
1 Q Does the record indicate that he also missed a
2 number of appointments with his cardiologist?
3 A It does show that, yes.
4 Q Does the record also tell us that on several
5 occasions he refused to accept pain management
6 referrals that had been offered to him?
7 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
8 can answer.
9 A I believe that is the case.
10 Q Wouldn't it be fair to state that even if he
11 had seen a pain management specialist at any
12 point in time, there's a very good possibility
13 that this outcome would have been averted?
14 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
15 can answer.
16 A No. Pain specialists really have historically
17 not engaged in diagnosing and management of
18 addiction, so I would not think that this
19 would have been averted had he been referred
20 to -- or had he attended a pain management
21 appointment.
22 Q But pain management specialists certainly can
23 suspect when somebody is suffering from an
24 opioid use disorder, correct?
25 A They can, yes.
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

93
1 Q I mean, you believe that this internist should
2 have had that suspicion, right?
3 A I believe that the person prescribing the
4 opioids has a duty to be ever watchful for
5 this problem.
6 Q What was your understanding as to how
7 Mr. Dukeshire received the narcotics, drugs,
8 whatever you want to call them, that ended up
9 leading to his death?
10 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
11 can answer.
12 A I am not sure.
13 Q Well, I assume you know that the drugs that he
14 ingested just prior to his death were received
15 from one of his friends or associates, a
16 Mr. Jurovcik, you're aware of that, aren't
17 you?
18 A I believe that's what his wife speculates in
19 the -- in her testimony. Is that correct?
20 Q Well, she didn't speculate. She actually saw
21 it happen; you're aware of that, aren't you?
22 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
23 can answer.
24 A I'm aware that she states she saw it happen,
25 yes.
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

94
1 Q Assuming that the drugs that immediately led
2 to Mr. Dukeshire's death were provided by
3 Mr. Jurovcik, you would agree that his
4 criminal conduct contributed to
5 Mr. Dukeshire's death, true?
6 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
7 can answer.
8 A His criminal conduct contributed to? Yes, it
9 did contribute.
10 Q Do you believe that Mrs. Dukeshire should have
11 told Dr. Gallagher about the fact that her
12 husband was purchasing narcotics on an illicit
13 basis over the last two years of his life?
14 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
15 can answer.
16 A Well, I believe it was reasonable for her to
17 express concern, which she did.
18 Q But she never told Dr. Gallagher that her
19 husband was buying narcotics off the street,
20 crushing them, and snorting them, correct?
21 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
22 can answer.
23 A I am not sure what she did or did not tell
24 him, but what I saw was that she says I came
25 to him, I called him, I said I am worried
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

95
1 about him being addicted to these medications
2 and I'm worried what is going to happen to
3 him; which I am not -- I guess it sounds like
4 mention of the word heroin would have really
5 sealed it off, but it sounds like she did
6 exactly what she was supposed to do, or what I
7 would have advised her to do, which is express
8 concern.
9 Q Well, if she knew that her husband was buying
10 drugs on the street, crushing them, and
11 snorting them, that's specific information she
12 should have given Dr. Gallagher, true?
13 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
14 can answer.
15 A I'm not -- yeah, I'm not going to put that on
16 her. That would have -
17 Q That would have helped, right?
18 A I am not going to comment on that. What I
19 will again comment on is any number of urine
20 drug screens would have shown that in black
21 and white and it wouldn't have mattered what
22 she was reporting or not reporting. So I am
23 not going to put that on her.
24 Q Well, you can't say that a urine drug screen
25 would have shown anything other than the
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

96
1 narcotics he was receiving, can you?
2 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
3 can answer.
4 A If you are asserting that you are certain that
5 he was snorting heroin, it would have shown up
6 in a urine drug screen.
7 Q I am not saying he was snorting heroin. I'm
8 saying he was crushing up his ox -- his
9 narcotic and snorting that.
10 A Only his?
11 Q What do you mean only his?
12 A The ones prescribed to him?
13 Q No. And medications that he was getting off
14 the street.
15 A But only oxycodone?
16 Q Right.
17 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
18 can answer.
19 Q If that's the case, a urine drug screen isn't
20 going to tell us anything other than that a
21 narcotic that's being prescribed for him is in
22 his system, true?
23 A I don't believe that if he was snorting
24 opioids, it was only ever oxycodone.
25 Q What's the basis for that testimony?
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

97
1 A My belief.
2 Q Well, what do you mean your belief? I don't
3 follow that.
4 A Well, there is a wide array of opioids
5 available on the street, and if he was, as you
6 say, using illicit opioids from the streets,
7 it seems highly unlikely that it would always
8 only be oxycodone.
9 Q But as you sit here today, you see no
10 testimony from anybody which indicated that
11 Mr. Dukeshire was snorting heroin, correct?
12 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
13 can answer.
14 A Correct.
15 Q You mentioned at the beginning of your
16 deposition that in February of 2016 there was
17 an episode of what you considered drug
18 toxicity that could have been secondary to a
19 narcotic overdose; do you recall that?
20 A Yes.
21 Q And the records from that February 2016
22 admission, you have seen those records,
23 correct?
24 A Yes.
25 Q Did any of the physicians who were involved in
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

98
1 Mr. Dukeshire's care during that hospital
2 admission diagnose an overdose?
3 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
4 can answer.
5 A They did not.
6 Q And they were aware of the fact that he was on
7 narcotics, correct?
8 A They were.
9 Q And I think the diagnosis from the physicians
10 during that admission was that he had suffered
11 a conversion reaction secondary to anxiety and
12 depression, correct?
13 A Correct.
14 Q Are you critical of the physicians who were
15 involved in that aspect of his care?
16 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
17 can answer.
18 A I'm critical of them leaving off the
19 possibility that this was a -- the possibility
20 that this could have been a drug toxicity
21 reaction.
22 Q They did tell him that he should follow up
23 with a psychiatrist, though, correct?
24 A I believe so, yes.
25 Q And he didn't do that, correct?
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

99
1 A Correct.
2 Q And I think you also made reference to an
3 emergency room visit in August of 2017 as a
4 potential episode of narcotic overdose; would
5 you agree that no one during that ER visit
6 found any evidence of an addiction issue,
7 correct?
8 A That's correct.
9 Q Would you agree that at various points in time
10 during Mr. Dukeshire's care with
11 Dr. Gallagher, he was admitted to hospitals
12 and placed on some pretty high doses of
13 narcotics during those admissions, correct?
14 A Yes.
15 Q For instance, I saw from the record in
16 December of 2014 when he was treated at the
17 Cleveland Clinic for back issues, he was on a
18 narcotic dose that was the equivalent of 225
19 mme, you saw that, correct?
20 A Yes.
21 Q That was appropriate?
22 A It's difficult to say without direct knowledge
23 of other factors going on in the care at that
24 time.
25 Q But as you sit here today, you are not

2 of those issues at that point in time breached
3 the standard of care, are you?
4 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
5 can answer.
6 A I'm not saying that.
7 Q And the records show that in December of 2015
8 when Mr. Dukeshire was at Saint Luke's
9 Hospital for his knee abscess, he was on 220
10 mme, was that within the standard of care?
11 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
12 can answer.
13 A Nothing during the hospitalization that I saw
14 suggested below the standard of care.
15 Q In January of 2017 he was at Freemont Hospital
16 again for his right knee issues and he was on
17 200 mme of narcotics, that was within the
18 standard of care?
19 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
20 can answer.
21 A I am not willing to suggest it was below.
22 Q Then in May of 2017 he was at the Toledo
23 Hospital for his buttocks ulcer and he was on
24 a dose of 220 mme for narcotics, that wasn't
25 below the standard of care, was it?
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.

101
1 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
2 can answer.
3 A I saw nothing to suggest it was below the
4 standard of care.
5 Q Then in June of 2017 he was back at Freemont
6 Hospital for right knee and buttocks issues,
7 and it looks like he was actually on 500 mme
8 for a period of time, are you critical of that
9 usage?
10 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
11 can answer.
12 A When we start to talk about, you know, three,
13 four times what his outpatient dose was, it
14 does start to call into question what's the
15 explanation for the need for that high of a
16 dose.
17 Q So that's a little high?
18 A That's a little high.
19 Q And then it looks like in July of 2017 he was
20 at the Bethesda Care Center for his buttocks
21 and right knee issues and they had him on 300
22 mme, was that within the accepted standard of
23 care?
24 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
25 can answer.
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

102
1 A Nothing to state that it was below the
2 standard of care, but I will note in all these
3 instances you're talking about a controlled
4 setting, where monitoring can easily take
5 place. In an outpatient setting where the
6 prescriber really needs to be relying on, and
7 I'll say it again, not to be a broken record,
8 but urine drug screens to know exactly what
9 the patient is taking.
10 Q What's your understanding as to what
11 Mr. Dukeshire was doing from a working
12 standpoint during the years 2014 through 2017?
13 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
14 can answer.
15 A I don't have a precise timeline. I believe
16 some period of that time he was repossessing
17 cars.
18 Q So it appears as though he was able to do some
19 sort of physical activity?
20 A Yes.
21 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
22 can answer.
23 A Yes.
24 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Marc, are you done or
25 should we take a break now?
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

103
1 MR. GROEDEL: I would say I got
2 another maybe 15, 20 minutes, or so. You can
3 take a break. If you would like to take a
4 break, I'm perfectly fine; or we can continue
5 to just plow ahead. Either way.
6 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Let's take a break
7 then.
9 (Recess taken)
11 MR. GROEDEL: Doctor, we're back on
12 the record.
13 Q Is it your understanding that the narcotics
14 that or the drugs that Mr. Dukeshire received
15 on the day he died, that he also received
16 narcotics from that person previously?
17 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
18 can answer.
19 A I don't know.
20 Q You don't recall seeing that in
21 Mrs. Dukeshire's deposition?
22 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
23 can answer.
24 A Correct, I don't recall.
25 Q If the family knew that Mr. Dukeshire was
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

104
1 using heroin, is that something they should
2 have brought to Dr. Gallagher's attention?
3 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
4 can answer.
5 A Not necessarily.
6 Q Would you agree that the carfentanil that was
7 found on toxicology was of a sufficient dose
8 in and of itself to cause Mr. Dukeshire's
9 death by respiratory depression?
10 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
11 can answer.
12 A Yes.
13 Q Would you agree that the oxycodone that they
14 found in his system, while it was above the
15 therapeutic level, was not at a toxic level?
16 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection.
17 A There is a very weak correlation between serum
18 and other fluid levels postmortem, and what
19 one would call quote/unquote toxic levels.
20 It's something some pathologists like to opine
21 on, but there is really no data to support
22 this. What we can say for sure is that the
23 combination of benzodiazepine, oxycodone, and
24 carfentanil was enough to kill him, because
25 that's what killed him.
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

105
1 Q But you would agree, though, that the level of
2 oxycodone in his system, particularly for
3 somebody who was tolerant like Mr. Dukeshire
4 was, wasn't at a toxic level?
5 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, asked and
6 answered, but you can answer.
7 A We don't know the level that he -- that is in
8 his system when he dies, could have been at
9 any stage of metabolism. We don't know what
10 it was at its peak. We just know what it was
11 when the blood is drawn, so it's sort of a
12 meaningless bit of data.
13 Q So based upon that answer, you really can't
14 say whether or not the oxycodone was a
15 significant contributing factor to his death,
16 correct?
17 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
18 can answer.
19 MR. MCMANUS: I'm sorry. I didn't
20 hear that question.
21 Q You would agree that based upon what you just
22 told me, that you really can't say that the
23 oxycodone was a significant contributing
24 factor to the patient's death, can you?
25 MR. MCMANUS: Thank you.
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

106
1 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection.
2 A I can't. I can say that it was likely a
3 significant contributor to his death.
4 Q Would you agree that he would have died if he
5 had just received the carfentanil?
6 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
7 can answer.
8 A It is possible that just receiving the
9 carfentanil could have been fatal.
10 Q Do you know what carfentanil looks like?
11 A Yes.
12 Q What's it looked like?
13 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
14 can answer.
15 A I can -- I don't care to answer.
16 Q Why not?
17 A Is it relevant?
18 Q Well, here's the point I'm trying to figure
19 out: Does crushed carfentanil look different
20 than crushed oxycodone?
21 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
22 can answer.
23 A Does it look different? Yes.
24 Q In what way?
25 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

107
1 can answer.
2 A Well, I guess depending on the degree of
3 crushing that goes on, it may look -- it may
4 not look different. I'm going to revise my
5 statement that it looks different.
6 Q Is the color different?
7 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
8 can answer.
9 A Not necessarily.
10 Q Have you seen carfentanil?
11 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
12 can answer.
13 A I have seen a picture.
14 Q What color was it in the picture?
15 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
16 can answer.
17 A It was white.
18 Q This was a narcotic overdose death, is that
19 your opinion?
20 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
21 can answer.
22 A Yes.
23 Q How does a narcotic overdose death manifest
24 itself from a clinical standpoint, what do we
25 see?
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

108
1 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
2 can answer.
3 A The respiratory depression and depression of
4 consciousness. In the fatal version we see
5 complete cessation of respiration and then
6 cardiopulmonary collapse.
7 Q Is it a gradual process?
8 A No.
9 Q How long does it usually take?
10 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
11 can answer.
12 A A matter of seconds to minutes.
13 Q So with a narcotic overdose death, is there
14 usually a period of an increasing sedation?
15 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
16 can answer.
17 A I mean, there could be, yes.
18 Q Then there is a slowing of respiration?
19 A Yes.
20 Q Followed by a cessation of respiration?
21 A Correct.
22 Q To your knowledge, did Mr. Dukeshire's final
23 moments, according to Mrs. Dukeshire, follow
24 that course?
25 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

109
1 can answer.
2 A I'm not sure.
3 Q Why aren't you sure?
4 A I don't recall how she described the event.
5 Q Did Mr. Dukeshire's cardiac condition place
6 him at high risk for a sudden cardiac death?
7 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
8 can answer.
9 A Yes.
10 Q What cardiac conditions did he have that would
11 have placed him at a higher risk for a sudden
12 cardiac death?
13 A I want to be clear that I am convinced that he
14 died of opioid overdose, but in terms of his
15 risk for sudden cardiac death, which I don't
16 believe is at play here, he had a history of
17 atrial fibrillation.
18 Q In your opinion did Mr. Dukeshire have any
19 chronic conditions that would have had an
20 adverse impact upon his life expectancy,
21 assuming he didn't die on the day that he did?
22 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
23 can answer.
24 A Yes, he did.
25 Q So what conditions did he have that would have
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

110
1 had an adverse impact upon his life
2 expectancy?
3 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
4 can answer.
5 A Morbid obesity and sleep apnea.
6 Q According to the autopsy he also had severe
7 cardiomegaly, true?
8 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
9 can answer.
10 A Yes, that's true.
11 Q What was the cause of that severe
12 cardiomegaly?
13 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
14 can answer.
15 A So he had an echocardiogram in I believe 2016
16 that shows pretty well preserved ejection
17 fraction. So the cardiomegaly was likely due
18 to enlarged right-sided heart from obstructive
19 sleep apnea.
20 Q How would you characterize the degree of
21 cardiomegaly?
22 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
23 can answer, if you can answer.
24 A I would need to look at the pathology report
25 again.
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

111
1 Q So his heart, according to the pathology
2 report, weighed 680 grams. It's my
3 understanding that an adult normal heart
4 weighs anywhere from 280 to 312 grams.
5 So assuming my figures aren't that far
6 off, his heart was about double the size of a
7 normal human heart, correct, for an adult?
8 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
9 can answer.
10 A I am not aware of any of those measurements,
11 but your math is correct.
12 Q Would the presence of that degree of
13 cardiomegaly also have had an adverse impact
14 upon Mr. Dukeshire's life expectancy had he
15 not died on the die he did?
16 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
17 can answer, if you can.
18 A As a physician who deals with living people,
19 we think about symptoms and disease states
20 that are manifest by symptoms, and when I hear
21 cardiomegaly, I hear congestive heart failure,
22 which based on his relatively preserved
23 ejection fraction of 55 to 60 percent, didn't
24 appear that he had.
25 Q So you don't believe he ever had evidence of
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

112
1 congestive heart failure during the course of
2 time he was treated by Dr. Gallagher?
3 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
4 can answer.
5 A I can only tell you that the echocardiogram
6 report showing a relatively preserved ejection
7 fraction of 55 to 60 percent.
8 Q Well, that was more than a year before he
9 died, right?
10 A Yeah. It's a chronic condition, can worsen
11 gradually over time, true.
12 Q Would you agree that his autopsy showed
13 evidence of significant cardiomyopathy?
14 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
15 can answer, if you can.
16 A Yeah, I would need to go back and look. You
17 were talking about according to the weight of
18 the heart, which isn't really -- I'm not
19 familiar with.
20 Q Here, I'll tell you. The right ventricle
21 thickness was measured at 1 centimeter, and
22 according to what I have seen, the normal
23 thickness of a right ventricle is 3 to 5
24 millimeters. So Mr. Dukeshire's right
25 ventricle thickness was almost three times
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

113
1 normal. If my numbers are correct, would you
2 agree with that?
3 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
4 can answer, if you can.
5 A Yes, I agree with that, and that right-sided
6 hypertrophy is consistent with his history of
7 obstructive sleep apnea.
8 Q Is it also consistent with hypertensive heart
9 disease?
10 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
11 can answer, if you can.
12 A As we typically see in hypertensive heart
13 disease, it presents on the left side of the
14 heart, left ventricular contractility, that's
15 where we see the reduced ejection fraction;
16 and as I mentioned, last known EF was close to
17 normal.
18 Q So if his left ventricle was thicker than
19 normal, would that be consistent with
20 hypertensive heart disease?
21 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
22 can answer, if you can.
23 A It would be, but the thicker than normal is
24 actually just the first stage. Then over
25 time, decades, the heart starts to thin out
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

114
1 and become floppy, and that's when your
2 ejection fraction starts to come down. So I'm
3 actually impressed by the fact that there was
4 no evidence of that.
5 Q No evidence of what?
6 A Thinning of the left ventricle.
7 Q His lung was noted to weigh 760 grams, his
8 right lung. His left lung was noted to weigh
9 640 grams. Would you consider those weights
10 to be abnormal?
11 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
12 can answer.
13 A Yeah, as a non pathologist, I don't know.
14 Q He also had an enlarged liver. It looks like
15 his liver weighed about twice the normal
16 weight of a liver, do you have an opinion as
17 to the cause of that?
18 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
19 can answer, if you can.
20 A Very well could be fatty liver, which wouldn't
21 surprise me in a man of his weight.
22 Q Would you agree that based upon what we know
23 about Mr. Dukeshire's medical history and what
24 was found on the autopsy, he had a reduced
25 life expectancy had he not died on the day
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

115
1 that he did?
2 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, but you
3 can answer, if you can.
4 A Reduced? I would say yeah, you know, by a
5 matter of a couple of years.
6 Q So it's your testimony that Mr. Dukeshire's
7 life expectancy, had he not died when he did,
8 would only be a couple years less than what
9 the normal life expectancy would be for a 55
10 year old gentleman?
11 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection. Calls for
12 speculation.
13 A His life was cut short by well more than a
14 decade, in my view.
15 Q As a result of his pre-existing conditions?
16 A No. As a result of overdose death, as a
17 result of unmonitored, untreated opioid
18 addiction.
19 Q So is it your belief then that his life
20 expectancy would have been an additional ten
21 years had he not died from opioid use
22 disorder?
23 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection. That's
24 not what he said.
25 MR. GROEDEL: That's what I thought
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

116
1 he said.
2 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Over ten years. You
3 limited his testimony, limited it and changed
4 the way he referenced it.
5 Q What is your testimony then as to what
6 Mr. Dukeshire's probable life expectancy would
7 have been had he not died from opioid
8 overdose?
9 A I would say he had at least ten more years to
10 live.
11 Q Just one quick question about the research
12 that you told us about oh, a long time ago, it
13 seems.
14 The research that you are doing, can
15 you just explain for me a little bit about
16 what's involved with that research?
17 A Yeah. I'm glad I'm having a chance to clarify
18 this. So the research is very much what we
19 call patient oriented research. We are
20 enrolling patients into clinical studies where
21 we deliver actual clinical care. So even
22 though it's done under research protocols, we
23 are treating patients, I am treating patients
24 with usual clinical intervention. It's very
25 much hands-on patient care, it's just done
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

117
1 under the scope of a research protocol.
2 Q So the patients that are involved in these
3 research protocols, are the patients that you
4 see on Tuesday?
5 A No. By and large they are other patients from
6 around the -- from the VA population.
7 Q So they are not your patients then, are they?
8 A Well, they're patients who have enrolled in
9 our studies, so I -- when you say they are not
10 my patients, you mean am I their primary care
11 doctor or?
12 Q Right. Are you the doctor of any of the
13 patients that are enrolled in these research
14 projects?
15 MR. ABRAMOWITZ: Objection, that's
16 asked and answered. He said he was. But you
17 can answer again.
18 A I'm treating them under a study protocol, so
19 that would be they are my patients.
20 Q So are these the patients then that you see on
21 Tuesday?
22 A Those patients are typically not enrolled in a
23 study protocol, so they are typically a
24 different set of patients.
25 Q I got the impression from your earlier
Versagi Court Reporters, Inc.


-----

118
1 testimony that the only day you actually see
2 patients is on Tuesday. So when is it that
3 you see these other patients that you say are
4 yours that are enrolled in these research
5 projects?
6 A Right. Any of the other days of the week,
7 Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
8 Q Where do you see them?
9 A In the outpatient setting. We have separate
10 facilities for people involved in clinical
11 trials.
12 Q So these patients then that are involved in
13 these research projects, are you actually, are
14 you yourself the physician actually providing
15 hands-on care, or do you supervise the care
16 that's provided by others?
17 A A mixture of both. I do some hands-on and
18 some supervision.
19 Q And to what extent do you provide hands-on
20 care to these patients?
21 A A good two-thirds of that time.
22 Q Doctor, have we covered all of the standard of
23 care criticisms that you plan on offering at
24 trial?
25 A Yes.

1 Q As we have requested previously with regard to
2 your opinions as to the standard of care of a
3 primary care physician, specifically those set
4 forth against Dr. Gallagher in this case, if
5 you are going to be presenting any of the
6 evidence that you just discussed, articles, or
